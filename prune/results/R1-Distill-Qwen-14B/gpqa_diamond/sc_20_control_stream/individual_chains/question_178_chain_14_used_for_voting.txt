Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine whether the theory is renormalizable. Let's see. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. Right, and F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field, I think, or maybe another gauge field. Wait, in this case, since the fields are ψ, which is a spinor, and F is antisymmetric, it's probably something like a gauge interaction term.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should determine the mass dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because action is dimensionless, and action is integral of Lagrangian over d^4x, which has dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So, the term is κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me break it down. Each field has a specific dimension. I think the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because, in four dimensions, the action is ∫ L d^4x, so each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. The kinetic term for ψ is something like iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which would be [ψ̄][∂][ψ]. Since ∂ has dimension 1, ψ must have dimension 3/2 because 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4. So ψ has [ψ] = 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, I think. So the σ_{μν} doesn't change the dimension of the term. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimension [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ_{μν}] but wait, σ is made of γ matrices which are dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3, but wait, no—wait, ψ̄ is the adjoint, which has the same dimension as ψ, right? So ψ̄ is 3/2, and ψ is 3/2, so together, 3/2 +3/2=3. Then multiply by σ, which is dimensionless, so the term ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Then we have F^{μν}. The field strength tensor F is typically ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A (the gauge field) is dimension 1. Because the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is like F^2, which would be (∂A)^2, so each F has dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) times F. So that's κ * (3) * (2) = 3 + 2 =5, but wait, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) F must have dimension 4.

Wait, wait, let's recalculate that. Let's see:

[ψ̄] = 3/2

[σ_{μν}] = 0 (since it's made of γ matrices, dimensionless)

[ψ] =3/2

So [ψ̄ σ ψ] =3/2 + 3/2=3.

[F^{μν}] =2.

So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F] =3 * 2 =5.

So the entire term is κ * (5). Since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ] is -1. That would make the dimension correct. So the first part of the question: the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at options, options A and C have [κ]=-1. Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable.

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constant must have a mass dimension ≤ 0. Wait, wait, what's the condition? Let me think. The general rule is that in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ (4 - [vertices dimension]). Wait, maybe I should think about the superficial degree of divergence.

In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the superficial degree of divergence is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields at the vertex). If D is negative, the amplitude is convergent, which is good. So for each vertex, the dimension from the fields plus the coupling's dimension must be ≤4.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a term in the Lagrangian, the mass dimension of the coupling is [κ] = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields). So for this term, sum of the fields' dimensions is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F]. [ψ̄] = 3/2, [ψ] =3/2, [F] =2. So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2= 3 +2=5. So [κ] =4 -5= -1.

Wait, but in terms of renormalizability, the coupling's mass dimension must be ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because for each loop, you get a factor of momentum integrals, which contribute to the dimension. So if the coupling has negative dimension, each loop would make it more divergent, so the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The renormalizability condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0. Because, for each vertex, the coupling's dimension plus the sum of the fields' dimensions (each field comes with a certain dimension) must be ≤ 4. Wait, no, the condition is that for each term in the Lagrangian, the dimension must be 4. So when considering the possible terms, the coupling must have a dimension that allows the term to be of dimension 4.

Wait, no, perhaps another way: If the coupling has negative mass dimension, then each insertion of that term would contribute negative dimensions to the amplitude. So when you have loops, each loop brings a factor of momentum, which is dimension 1. So in a loop integral, each loop would contribute 4 dimensions (since it's four-dimensional integral), but the coupling might make it worse.

Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4L - (sum for each vertex of ( [vertex] + sum of [fields] )). Wait, perhaps a better formula is D = 4 - E, where E is the number of propagators. Or wait, maybe the formula is D = d - (sum over each vertex ( [coupling] + number of fields at vertex * [field] )) × ?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the superficial degree of divergence for Feynman diagrams. The formula is D = 4 - (sum over vertices of ( (n - 2) * [coupling] )), where n is the number of lines at the vertex? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, the general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction term has a higher dimension, which would require more fields than possible in a renormalizable theory.

In our case, κ has dimension -1, which is less than zero. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable. Because each vertex introduces a factor of κ, which has negative dimension, so each vertex contributes to making the diagram more divergent as you add more loops. So the theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. So the answer should be C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, so $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has dimension $[A_\mu] = 1$. Since $F^{\mu\nu} \sim \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, it follows that $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4, as the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking it down:
- $[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 = 3$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

Thus, the product $[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 3 \times 2 = 5$. To ensure the term has dimension 4, $\kappa$ must have:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension $\geq 0$. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies the interaction term is non-renormalizable because the coupling constant introduces divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
