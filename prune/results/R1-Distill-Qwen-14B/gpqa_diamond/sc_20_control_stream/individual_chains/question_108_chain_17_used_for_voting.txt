Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

The question is talking about a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. Since the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, I guess that means m is either 0 or maybe 1, but not a large number. Oh wait, m can take values from -l to +l, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. But the exact value might not matter here, more the fact that it's small.

The problem mentions a paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. I remember that the paramagnetic effect arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but in the context of orbital angular momentum, maybe it's the orbital magnetic moment, which is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l/(l+1/2)) or something like that? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for the paramagnetic term, maybe it's the Zeeman effect we're talking about here.

Wait, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels when a magnetic field is applied. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital angular momentum, μ = (μ_B) m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So the energy shift would be ΔE = μ_B * B * m. But wait, since m is small, like maybe m=0 or m=1, the shift would be proportional to that.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism typically involves the interaction of the electron's spin with the magnetic field. Oh, right, the Zeeman effect can be split into the orbital and spin contributions. So the paramagnetic term is the spin part. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is about 2 for electrons. So the energy shift would be ΔE_paramag = μ_s · B = g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, for the ground state, l=0, so the orbital contribution would be zero. So the paramagnetic effect here would be due to the spin part. But wait, no, the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh, wait, no, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but m is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is the same as m, which is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. But for the paramagnetic effect, I believe we're considering the spin magnetic moment. So maybe the question is about the orbital contribution, which would be part of the diamagnetic term. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spin-orbit coupling. But I'm not sure. Let me read the question again. It says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom". Oh, right, transition energy is the energy difference between two states, like when an electron transitions between energy levels and emits or absorbs a photon. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm, but wait 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the Balmer beta line, like the H-beta line. So the energy difference ΔE would be the energy corresponding to that photon.

So first, I need to compute ΔE. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is wavelength. So let's compute that. Let me get the numbers right.

h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c = 3.00 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 0.4861 micrometers = 486.1 x 10^-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approximately 4.089e-18 J.

Wait, but wait. Hydrogen's energy levels are quantized. The transition for H-alpha is from n=3 to n=2, but H-beta is from n=4 to n=2, I think. Anyway, the exact n values might not matter; what matters is the energy scale of the transition.

But wait, 486 nm is approximately the wavelength for the transition from n=4 to n=2, which is the H-beta line. The energy of the photon emitted is the difference between the two energy levels. So the energy of the photon is given by E = hc/λ, which I calculated as about 4.089e-18 J.

Alternatively, it's more common to express this energy in electron volts (eV). So let's convert that. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 4.089e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 25.5 eV. Wait, that can't be right because the energy levels of hydrogen are much lower. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. 486 nm is about 4.86e-7 meters. Oh wait, no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1e-6 meters? No, wait, micrometers is 1e-6 meters. 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1e-9 meters. So λ = 4.861e-7 meters? Wait no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nanometers, which is 4.861e-7 meters. Oh, okay, correct.

Wait, no, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1e-9 meters.

So h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) )

Wait, 4.861e-7 is 486.1e-9, so 4.861e-7 meters.

So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = let me compute this.

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ approximately 0.409 * 1e-18 = 4.09e-19 J.

So E = about 4.09e-19 J.

Converting to eV: 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels of hydrogen are much smaller. For example, the ground state is about -13.6 eV, n=2 is about -3.4 eV, n=3 is about -1.5 eV, n=4 is about -0.85 eV. So the transition from n=4 to n=2 would release energy: E = E_2 - E_4. Let me compute that.

The energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV.

E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.

So ΔE = E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. Which matches our earlier calculation. So that makes sense.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman shift due to the spin magnetic moment. The energy shift is given by ΔE_paramag = μ_B * g_s * m_s * B.

Wait, but μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.27e-24 J/T.

g_s is the Landé g-factor for spin, which is approximately 2 for electrons.

m_s is the spin quantum number, which can be +1/2 or -1/2.

B is given as 1 Tesla.

So substituting, ΔE_paramag = (9.27e-24 J/T) * 2 * (0.5) * 1 T.

Wait, m_s is 1/2, so 0.5.

So ΔE_paramag = 9.27e-24 * 2 * 0.5 * 1 = 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, let's compute that. 9.27e-24 J is about 9.27e-24 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

So ΔE_paramag ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term compared to ΔE, which is 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the ratio is about 5.8e-5 eV compared to 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the paramagnetic coupling term is ⟨H⟩. The problem states: compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (⟨H⟩) with ΔE. So ⟨H⟩ is the energy shift due to the magnetic field.

So in the question, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

So looking at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → No, 5.8e-5 eV is much less than 2.55 eV.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → No, it's much smaller.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → Yes, it's much less.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → No.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but another thing to consider: the question says "for small values of m". Oh wait, wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. But I thought the paramagnetic effect is due to spin (m_s). But perhaps in this problem, the coupling is due to the orbital effect. Let me think again.

Wait, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (μ_B) * m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So for orbital magnetic quantum number m, which is l, m can range from -l to +l. But the problem says small m, so perhaps m is 0 or 1, but if l is small, like l=0 (s orbital), m=0, then the orbital contribution is zero. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is zero, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the spin contribution.

Wait, but the question says "paramagnetic coupling term", which is the spin term. So in that case, m_s is either +1/2 or -1/2. So the energy shift would be proportional to m_s, which is 0.5. But earlier, I calculated that the shift is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way less than 2.55 eV.

So the conclusion remains that the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE. So the correct answer would be option C.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energy scales.

### Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)
The transition energy corresponds to the photon emitted during the \( n=4 \to n=2 \) transition in hydrogen, which has a wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu \text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). The energy of the photon is given by:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E \approx \frac{4.09 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the spin magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). The energy shift due to this interaction is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{paramag}} = \mu_B g_s m_s B
\]

where:
- \( \mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton,
- \( g_s \approx 2 \) is the Landé g-factor for spin,
- \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) is the spin quantum number,
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength.

Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{paramag}} = (9.27 \times 10^{-24})(2)(0.5)(1) \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{paramag}} \approx \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{paramag}} \) is approximately \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Clearly:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{paramag}} \ll \Delta E
\]

### Correct Option
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \)**

Answer: C
