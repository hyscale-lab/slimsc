Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me think. I remember that Lagrangians are used in quantum field theory to describe the dynamics of particles and fields.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think σ_{μν} is a antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the electromagnetic field tensor, right? So this term probably represents some interaction between fermions and electromagnetism, maybe a higher-order term.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. From what I remember, the mass dimension of a coupling constant is important for determining renormalizability. If the theory is renormalizable, the dimension is such that the interaction doesn't introduce higher-order divergences beyond what can be absorbed by the existing terms.

So, first step: determine the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4), you get an action which is dimensionless (in natural units, where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me break down the term: κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each component has a certain dimension.

I know that for fermions, the field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac Lagrangian is something like iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, and each derivative has dimension 1, so ψ̄ and ψ must each have dimension 3/2 to make the term dimension 4.

σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix is dimensionless (since they're just matrices), so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism. The Maxwell term is like F_{μν} F^{μν}, and each F has dimension 2. Because the Maxwell Lagrangian is (F_{μν}^2)/4, which is dimension 4. So each F has dimension 2.

Wait, but wait. F^{μν} is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. The field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which would give each F^{μν} a mass dimension of 2. Because the derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1 (since the Maxwell term is (∂A)^2, so (∂A) has dimension 2, so A has dimension 1, and each F^{μν} is ∂ A, so dimension 2).

So, putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{mu nu}, psi, and F^{mu nu}.

Let me compute the dimensions:

ψ̄ has [3/2], ψ has [3/2], σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, F^{mu nu} has [2]. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the whole term has dimension 5. But since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, κ must adjust the dimension to get 4. So [κ] must be [5 -4] = +1? Wait wait, no. Wait, the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F). The product of the fields is dimension 5. So the entire term has dimension [κ] + 5. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, then [κ] +5=4 → [κ]= -1.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Because the Lagrangian is the integrand, so each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σμν ψ F^{μν}). The fields are all in this product. Let me compute the dimensions again.

ψ̄ and ψ each have 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ has 3. Then σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, so still 3. F^{mu nu} has 2. So the product is 3 + 2 = 5. So the entire term has dimension [κ] +5. But the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: The general rule is that the coupling constant's dimension can be found by considering the term. The term must have dimension 4. So,

κ [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}] = 4.

We know [ψ] = 3/2, [F^{μν}] = 2. [σ_{μν}] is [γ matrices squared], which are dimensionless.

So:

[κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 4.

Adding them: 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1. Yes, that's correct.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that narrows down the options to A or C.

Now the second part: Is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant's mass dimension. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constant must have a non-negative mass dimension. Because in perturbation theory, each vertex contributes a factor of the coupling constant, and the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the number of loops and the number of vertices.

Wait, wait, I think the rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (in 4D spacetime). Or wait, no, more accurately, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤4. But when considering the coupling constants, their dimension must be ≥0. Because if the dimension is negative, that means the coupling is dimensionful, and you can have an infinite number of terms when you go to higher energies (since you can multiply by higher powers of the momentum scale, leading to nonrenormalizable interactions).

Wait, another way: The dimension of the coupling constant in a renormalizable theory must satisfy [g] ≥ 0, because in 4D, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. The coupling constant is the coefficient of an operator of dimension d, so [g] =4 - d. So for the operator to be renormalizable, d ≤4, so [g] ≥0.

In this case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the term is nonrenormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. Because for each loop, you bring in a momentum factor, and if the coupling is dimensionful, you can't absorb all the divergences with a finite number of counterterms.

So the term is nonrenormalizable because [kappa] is -1.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me think again. The interaction term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So if the coupling κ has dimension -1, then the term is dimension 4. But when you write the Feynman rules, each vertex is multiplied by κ. But when considering the superficial degree of divergence, each vertex contributes [κ] in mass dimension. Wait, the superficial degree is computed as D = 4L - (E-1)(V), or some other formula. But perhaps a better approach is to think about the scaling.

In a renormalizable theory, all divergences can be absorbed into the existing terms. But if the coupling is dimensionful, you get higher-order terms in the Lagrangian that you haven't accounted for, which can't be absorbed by the existing counterterms, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

So since [κ]=-1, which is less than zero, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

So putting it together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left[ \gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu \right] \) and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the electromagnetic field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because it is integrated over spacetime (dimension 4) to yield a dimensionless action. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore have mass dimension 4.

- The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \), so \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has mass dimension \( 3 \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a commutator of gamma matrices and is dimensionless.
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( 2 \) because it is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has mass dimension \( 1 \).

The product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) therefore has mass dimension \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must adjust the dimension to 4. Thus:

\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that all divergences can be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. In this case, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) has mass dimension \( -1 \), which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the coupling is dimensionful, leading to an infinite number of higher-order terms that cannot be absorbed by the existing counterterms. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
