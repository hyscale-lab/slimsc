Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is similar to the 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which is a standard problem in quantum mechanics.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, each giving a possible energy and a number.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the energy levels of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, for a 3D isotropic HO, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again.

In each dimension (x, y, z), the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that dimension. So in 3D, the total energy is the sum across x, y, z. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Oh, right, and the total n is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each state can be specified by n_x, n_y, n_z, but the energy depends on their sum.

Wait, but another way to look at it is that for each energy level, the energy is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number, the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z. But wait, wait, that can't be exactly right. Because in three dimensions, each direction contributes, so n is the sum, and each state with the same n has the same energy. So the energy levels are degenerate.

So the energy for each state depends on the value of n = n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is when n=0, which gives E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1, so E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. The next state, n=2, E = (2 + 3/2) = 7/2. Then n=3, E= (3 + 3/2) = 9/2 ħω.

Wait, wait, the question is about the third excited state. Hmm, I need to clarify what the 'third excited state' refers to. In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, then first excited, second, etc. So, the ground state is n=0 (E=3/2 ħω), first excited is n=1 (E=5/2), second excited is n=2 (E=7/2), third excited would then be n=3 (E=9/2 ħω). So the energy for the third excited state is (9/2) ħω. That would match one of the options.

Now, the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. So for a given n, how many eigenfunctions are there with the same energy? Oh, this is the degeneracy of the energy level. The degeneracy is the number of distinct quantum states (i.e., distinct sets of quantum numbers) that have the same energy.

In 3D, for a given n = nx + ny + nz, the number of possible states is the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation. That's a combinatorics problem. The formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3-1) choose (3-1), which is (n+2 choose 2). Wait, yes, because in three variables, the number of solutions is (n + 3-1) choose (3-1) ) → (n+2 choose 2).

So for n=3, the number would be (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So for the third excited state (n=3), the energy is (9/2) ħω and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħ ω and 10. That matches. Option C says 9/2 ħω but with 3, which seems wrong. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm not getting confused with the excited state numbering. Ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state energy is indeed (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. So yes, correct.

Another option is looking at the possible states for each energy level. Let me see: n=0: 1 state (0,0,0). n=1: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) → 3 states. n=2: combinations where two are 0 and one is 2, or two are 1 and one is 0. So (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2) → 3, and (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) → 3 more. Total 6. So for n=2, degeneracy is 6. n=3: the number of solutions is (3+2 choose 2) = 10. So yes, 10 eigenfunctions.

So the correct answer is option A: (9/2) ħω, 10.

The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), which is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The energy eigenvalues are given by:

\[
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

Here, \( n \) is the total quantum number, and the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given \( n \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \). This is calculated using the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2}
\]

### Analysis of the Problem
1. **Energy of the Third Excited State**:  
   - The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), with energy \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \).  
   - The first excited state corresponds to \( n = 1 \), with energy \( E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \).  
   - The second excited state corresponds to \( n = 2 \), with energy \( E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \).  
   - The third excited state corresponds to \( n = 3 \), with energy \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).  

2. **Number of Eigenfunctions for the Third Excited State**:  
   For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
   \]  
   Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \)  
  This matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.  

- **Option B**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 10 \)  
  This energy expression is incorrect for the given potential.  

- **Option C**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \)  
  While the energy is correct, the degeneracy is incorrectly stated as 3 instead of 10.  

- **Option D**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 3 \)  
  Both the energy and degeneracy are incorrect.  

### Final Answer
The correct option is **A**, as it provides the correct energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the correct degeneracy of 10.
