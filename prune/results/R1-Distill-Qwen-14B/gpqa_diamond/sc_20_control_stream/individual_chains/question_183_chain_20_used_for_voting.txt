Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index. So the formula for calculating it is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens.

Wait, but in this case, we're looking at the product of a reaction. So I need to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break that down. The main structure is a cyclohexene ring. Cyclohexene has a double bond, so that's one degree of unsaturation right there.

Let me imagine the structure. The cyclohexene ring is substituted at positions 2, 3, and 5. Wait, position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?), and position 3 is part of the double bond. Or wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 maybe? So the ring has a double bond, so that's one degree.

Then, there's a formyl group on carbon 2. Formyl is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond (C=O), adding another degree. So that's two degrees so far.

The 5-vinyl group is a substituent attached to carbon 5. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so that's another double bond. So that's three degrees.

Wait, but wait. The parent is cyclohex-3-ene, which has one double bond. The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl (another double bond). The vinyl group is a double bond as well (CH2=CH-). So each of these contributes to the degree of unsaturation.

So the starting molecule's degree of unsaturation is 1 (from the ring) + 1 (carbonyl) +1 (vinyl double bond) =3? But wait, wait, the cyclohex-3-ene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one degree. The formyl group is a carbonyl, another. The vinyl group is another double bond. So 3 degrees in the starting material.

Now, what happens when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI?

Red phosphorus and HI usually do something... I think it's a reaction to remove carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but red phosphorus and HI is the same as the Wolff-Kishner conditions? Or maybe it's another reaction.

Wait no, wait. Red phosphorus with I2 (iodine) and a base is used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but that doesn't seem right here. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be used to reduce carbonyl groups. Oh wait! I think that's the phosphorus pentoxide method for ketone reductions. Or perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction.

Alternatively, wait, when carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) react with red phosphorus and HI, it's called the Fittig reaction, or another type of elimination. Or perhaps it's the reduction of ketones to alkanes.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carbonyl group to deoxygenate it. For example, aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to alkanes. So the formyl group (CHO) would be converted to CH2I (maybe). Because HI is in excess.

Wait, so the formyl group is a carbonyl, RCHO becomes RCH2I after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Or perhaps it becomes RCH2- something else? Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Alternatively, I'm mixing this up with another reaction. Let me try to think: when a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's known as the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction? No, that's for forming alkenes.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the individual reactions. The starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), and a cyclohexene ring.

The reaction conditions: red phosphorus (P) and excess HI. I think that this is a deoxygenation reaction. So the formyl group (CHO) is at position 2. So in the reaction, the carbonyl group (from CHO) would be converted into CH2I, perhaps?

Wait, I'm trying to recall. The Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones and aldehydes to CH2 groups using Zn-Hg (mercury) and HCl. But the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is called the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which eliminates the carbonyl group, replacing it with a methylene group (CH2).

Wait, no. The Wolff-Kishner reaction uses hydrazine, then strong base and heat to eliminate the carbonyl group, forming a C=N-NH2, which upon heating with a strong base (like KOH) eliminates to form a double bond. Wait, that's for ketones or aldehydes, giving alkanes or alkenes.

Wait, or maybe it's the Clemmensen that gives alkanes. Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn/Hg, which is a milder condition, leading to CH2 groups.

But wait, the question is about red phosphorus and HI. I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a case where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodide.

Wait, I think in this reaction, the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted to CH2I. Because red phosphorus and HI can deoxygenate carbonyl groups. Let me think of the mechanism. Red phosphorus might act as a reducing agent. The aldehyde group would react to form an aldehyde iodide, maybe RCH2I.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Staudinger reaction, but that involves triphenylphosphine and azides, not HI.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is cleavage of the carbonyl. Or maybe, more accurately, the reaction is the elimination of O and adding H and I. Let me think of the formyl group (CHO). If it's treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the O is replaced by H and I. Wait, maybe the aldehyde group is converted into CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group, releasing HIO3 or something similar.

So if the starting molecule has a CHO group, after reaction, it becomes CH2I? Or CH2.

Wait, but another point: the starting material has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) as a substituent. So that's a double bond, which would add to the degree of unsaturation.

Now, the reaction conditions: HI in excess. Maybe the vinyl group would also react. Wait, but wait, in the presence of HI, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would undergo some addition.

Wait, but the vinyl group is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the structure is cyclohexene with a substituent at position 5 which is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So when HI is added, maybe the vinyl group could undergo some addition. But vinyl groups are generally not that reactive unless under specific conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of HI, perhaps the double bond in the vinyl group could undergo an addition, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus as well. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the aldehyde group.

Let me try to outline the structure:

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So the cyclohexene ring (which is six-membered with one double bond) has substituents:

- At position 2: a formyl group (CHO)
- At position 5: a vinyl group (CH2=CH-)
- And a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 3? Wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3. So the cyclohexene has a double bond from 3-4 (if 3-en) and a carboxylic acid at 3. Wait, that might not be possible because the position of the double bond and the substituent could be overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at different positions.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (3-en), the carboxylic acid is at carbon 1, and the formyl at 2, and the vinyl at 5. But I might be getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, substituents: at carbon 2, formyl group; at carbon 5, vinyl group; and at carbon 1, a carboxylic acid group. Hmm, maybe, but it's a bit complicated.

But the key point is that the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (1), the formyl carbonyl (another), and the vinyl group (another). So the degree of unsaturation is 3.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens?

I think the aldehyde group (CHO) would be reduced. But I'm not exactly sure how. Another possibility is that the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodine, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation of the aldehyde group. The CHO group could be converted into CH2I. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is completely reduced to CH2 group.

Wait, the Clemmensen reaction reduces aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. So in that case, the CHO group becomes CH2.

But in this reaction, the conditions are red phosphorus and HI. I think that's the same as the Wolffenstein reaction, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a carbonyl deoxygenation, replacing the carbonyl with a CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with HI and red phosphorus can deoxygenate the aldehyde group to form an alkane. So the aldehyde CHO becomes CH2.

So the product would have the formyl group converted to a CH2 group. So the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2I? Or CH3? Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Another possibility is that the aldehyde group is converted to a CH2 group. So the formula changes from CHO to CH2.

Let me consider each part:

Original molecule:

- Cyclohexene ring (6 carbons, one double bond)
- Formyl group (CHO) at position 2: contributes another double bond.
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5: another double bond.
- Carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 3: which has a double bond (the carbonyl in COOH).

Wait, oh! I didn't consider the carboxylic acid. The COOH group has a carbonyl (C=O), which is another double bond, increasing the degree of unsaturation by one.

So starting molecule's degree of unsaturation: cyclohexene (1) + formyl (1) + vinyl (1) + COOH (1) = 4.

Wait, that's 4 degrees.

But wait, the question is about the product. So what happens to each of these when reacted.

Red phosphorus and HI: 

- The formyl group (CHO) is probably converted to CH2I or CH2. Let's say CH2I.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is a double bond. Would it react with HI? Maybe, but under what conditions. Excess HI would typically lead to addition, but in presence of red phosphorus, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Red phosphorus might be acting as a reducing agent. So perhaps the aldehyde group is being reduced. Alternatively, the reaction could be a substitution, replacing the O with I.

Wait, I found in my notes that when aldehydes react with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group is converted into a methyl iodide group. So, RCHO + (HI, red P) → RCH2I.

So in this case, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I. So that would change the structure.

Now, what about the other groups?

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is a double bond. Would this react under the same conditions? Maybe. Because HI is a dihalogen, perhaps the double bond would undergo addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the presence of excess HI, the vinyl group might undergo hydrohalogenation. But where? The vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Adding HI would lead to CH2I-CH2I? Or perhaps it would add H and I across the double bond, leading to CH2I-CH2.

Wait, but that would require the double bond to open. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group doesn't react under these conditions, as red phosphorus is a stronger reducing agent, and the aldehyde is the reactive group.

So, perhaps, the vinyl group remains as is.

As for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), what happens when it reacts with HI and red phosphorus? Carboxylic acids can be tricky. Maybe they are converted into something else. Alternatively, perhaps they are reduced as well.

Wait, another thought: the -COOH group is a carbonyl, so perhaps it would be reduced. Using red phosphorus and HI, the COOH might be converted into CH2OH, or perhaps into CH2I.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH group remains unchanged because it's more resistant to such conditions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the steps.

Original molecule has:

- Cyclohexene (1 double bond)
- Formyl group (1 double bond)
- Vinyl group (1 double bond)
- COOH group (1 double bond)

Total of 4 double bonds, so degree of unsaturation is 4.

After reaction:

- Formyl group becomes CH2I (so losing one double bond, from CHO to CH2I)
- What about the others?

Wait, the carboxylic acid, -COOH, if it's a carbonyl, would react. Maybe it's reduced as well. Suppose it becomes CH2OH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's converted to CH2I as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is converted into a methyl iodide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is unaffected because it's not reactive under these conditions.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are strong enough to reduce some functional groups, but maybe the carboxylic acid is more resistant.

So, let's assume:

- Formyl group (CHO) → CH2I (loses one degree)
- COOH remains as COOH → doesn't change (so still a carbonyl, contributing a degree)
- The vinyl group remains as is (so still a double bond, another degree)
- The cyclohexene ring remains as is (another degree)

So now, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene (1)
- Vinyl (1)
- COOH (1)
- CH2I (no double bond, so 0)
So total degrees: 3.

Wait, but that's not matching any options. The options are 0, 1,3,5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is reduced as well.

If the -COOH is reduced, for example, to -CH2OH, which is an alcohol, but that doesn't have a carbonyl, so it doesn't contribute to the degree. Or maybe even to -CH3.

Wait, but if the COOH is reduced to CH2OH, then the degree of unsaturation from the COOH group would decrease by one.

So let's recalculate.

Original degrees: 4.

After reaction:

- Formyl group: CHO → CH2I (loses 1)
- COOH → CH2OH (loses 1)
- Vinyl group remains (1)
- Cyclohexene remains (1)
So total is 1+1+1=3. Hmm, but the options have B)3 as an option.

Wait, but that would make the index 3, but wait, the product would have:

- cyclohexene (1)
- vinyl group (1)
- COOH (1 if it's still present as COOH, but if it's reduced, it may not contribute)
Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts all carbonyl groups into CH2 groups. So, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I (losing a double bond), the COOH group's carbonyl (C=O) becomes CH2, so the COOH becomes CH2OH (maybe) or CH2I. Alternatively, maybe both are converted to CH2 groups.

But wait, if the COOH is reduced, then the carboxylic acid becomes CH2OH (a primary alcohol), which would have no double bonds. So the COOH group's carbonyl (which was one degree) is gone.

So let's think:

Original degrees: 4 (1 from ring, 1 from formyl, 1 from vinyl, 1 from COOH).

After reaction:

- Formyl becomes CH2I (no double bond)
- COOH becomes CH2OH or CH2I (no double bond)
- Vinyl group remains (1 double bond)
- Ring remains (1 double bond)
So degrees after reaction: 1 (ring) +1 (vinyl) = 2.

But that's not an option either. The options are 0,1,3,5.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the reaction more accurately.

Another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is supposed to eliminate oxygen and add iodine. So, each carbonyl group (like CHO and COOH) would lose a double bond.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring (1 double bond)
- The vinyl group (1 double bond)
But no formyl or COOH carbonyls, as they are converted into CH2I or similar.

Wait, but what about the COOH group? If it's a carboxylic acid, can it react under these conditions?

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is not reactive here, so it remains as COOH, having a carbonyl. Then the degrees would be 1 (ring) +1 (vinyl) +1 (COOH). That's 3.

But what about the formyl group? It would have been converted to CH2I, so no longer a carbonyl.

So total degrees would be 3.

Which matches option B.

So the index is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains the following structural features:

1. A cyclohexene ring with one double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).
2. A formyl group (CHO) with a carbonyl double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) with a double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).
4. A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) with a carbonyl double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).

Thus, the starting material has a total degree of unsaturation of **4**.

When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. The formyl group (CHO) is deoxygenated to CH2I, eliminating the carbonyl double bond.
2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) remains unchanged, retaining its double bond.
3. The cyclohexene ring retains its double bond.
4. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged, retaining its carbonyl double bond.

After the reaction, the product has:

1. One double bond from the cyclohexene ring.
2. One double bond from the vinyl group.
3. One double bond from the carboxylic acid group.

The formyl group no longer contributes to the degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total degree of unsaturation of the product is **3**.

The correct answer is **B) 3**.

Answer: B
