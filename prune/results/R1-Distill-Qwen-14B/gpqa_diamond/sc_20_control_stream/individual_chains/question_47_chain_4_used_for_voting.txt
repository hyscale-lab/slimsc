Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem where I need to identify the compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (two oxygen atoms), y=1 (one nitrogen). Plugging in: (2*9 + 2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So DoU is 3. That could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus maybe a double bond or ring. Hmm, wait, benzene is three double bonds, so that's 4 DoU? Let me think again. Benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So each double bond is one DoU, but the ring itself is another. Wait, no, each ring or double bond is a DoU. So a benzene ring is three DoU: three double bonds. Wait no, each double bond is one, and each ring is another. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring? No, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So each double bond is a DoU, and the ring itself is another. So benzene has 4 DoU. But wait, if a molecule has a benzene ring, then the DoU from it would be 4. So if our compound has a benzene ring, which uses 4 of the 3 available DoU, that's a problem because 4>3. So maybe the benzene isn't the main contributor? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the DoU. The formula is C9H11NO2.

DoU = (2*9 +2 - 11 - 2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2= 3. So 3 DoU.

So if the compound has a benzene ring, that's 4 DoU, which is more than 3. So benzene can't be present. Wait, but that's confusing because the IR shows strong absorption around 3420 and 3325, which are indicative of N-H stretches, possibly amide or amine groups. And the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe ester or amide.

Wait, but if benzene isn't possible, maybe it's a substituted aromatic ring, but that requires 4 DoU. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound has a benzene ring plus a substituent that's a double bond or another ring. But that would require more DoU. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzene with something else. Let me think of the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has a benzene ring (4 DoU), and the carbonyl group (1 DoU), but that would sum to 5, which is way over the DoU of 3. So that can't be right. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2, so molecular formula is C7H7NO. Hmm, but our compound is C9H11NO2. So that would imply substituents. Let me check the molecular formulas of the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: Benzoic acid amide with an ethoxy group. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with NH2 would give C7H5NO2, but adding an ethoxy group would add C2H5, making it C9H10NO2. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps the structure is C6H5-O-C2H5 attached to another group. Wait, maybe I should compute the molecular formulas for each option.

Let me calculate each option's molecular formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2 (benzene ring, CONH2). Adding an ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C7 (from benzamide) + C2H5O (ethoxy) → so C9H10NO2? Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2 → C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group: OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C7 + C2H5O: So C9H10O2N? Wait, but our target is C9H11NO2, so perhaps the H count is off. Let me think: benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group would substitute a hydrogen on the benzene ring. So the formula would become C9H9NO2? Because benzamide is C7H7NO2: benzamide is C6H5-CONH2, which is C7H5NO2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write out the structures:

3-ethoxybenzamide is benzamide (PhCONH2) with an OCH2CH3 group at position 3. So the benzene has two substituents: OCH2CH3 and CONH2. So the molecular formula would be C6H5 (but with two substituents: OCH2CH3 and CONH2). So each substituent adds their own atoms.

Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 is C2H5O. CONH2 is C O N2 H2. Wait, wait: Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 adds 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens (since O is linked). CONH2 is one C, one O, two N, two H. So adding all together:

C6 + C2 (from ethoxy) + C1 (from CONH2) = 9 C. O is 2 (one from CONH2, one from ethoxy). N is 1 (from CONH2). Hydrogen: benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 takes one H, and CONH2 takes another; wait, benzene has five H in total when two substituents are present? No, benzene with two substituents would have four H. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me compute the molecular formula correctly.

3-Ethoxybenzamide: structure is O
           |
OCH2CH3-C6H4-CONH2

So the formula would be C6 (from benzene) + 2 C (ethoxy) + 2 C (from CONH2) → Wait, no. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group would add C2H5O. So molecular formula would be:

C7 (from benzamide) + C2H5O → C9 H11 O2 N? Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C9 H12 O3 N? But that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's C6H5-O-C2H5 connected to a CONH2, which is C6H5-O-C2H5-CONH2. So the formula is C6 + O (from O) + C2 (from ethoxy) + C (from CONH2) + N2 (from CONH2) + Hs.

Wait, let me compute:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide CO) = 9 C.

H: Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and CONH2). Each substituent takes one H each. So 5 H. Then, OCH2CH3 has 5 H (since the oxygen is connected to CH2CH3, which has 2 and 3 H, but the oxygen is connected to the CH2, so that group has 5 H. Plus the amide group: CONH2 has two H. So total H: 5 (benzene) +5 (ethoxy) +2 (amide) = 12? But molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: O
           |
OCH2CH3-C6H4-CONH2.

So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (CONH2) → Wait, CONH2 is one C. So total C is 6+2+2? No, CONH2 is one C. So 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide) =9 C. Correct.

Hydrogen: Benzene has 4 H (two substituents), ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), and amide has 2 H (NH2). So 4 +5 +2 =11 H. O: ethoxy has one O, amide has one O. So 2 O. N: one N from amide. So that's C9H11NO2. So yes, option A's formula matches.

So that's possible.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

Formamide is HCONR2. So structure would be HCO-NH-Ph-OCH2CH3, attached at the 4 position.

Molecular formula:

Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 adds 2C, 5H, 1O. HCONH adds H, C, O, N.

So:

Ph (C6) + ethoxy (C2) + HCONH (C2? Wait, HCONH is one C, one O, one N. So total C:6+2+1=9. O: ethoxy (1) + formamide (1) =2. N: 1. H: Let's see. Benzene with substituents: two substituents (ethoxy and formamide) → 4 H on benzene. Ethoxy has 5 H. Formamide: HCONH has the H from HCO, and the NH has two H. So wait, HCONH: HCO-NH-... So HCONH would have H from HCO and H from NH. So HCO has one H, NH has two H. So 3 H. So total H:4 (benzene) +5 (ethoxy) +3 (formamide) =12. But molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. So Option B's formula would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match. So Option B is out.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH3.

Ph is C6H5. Propionate is OCO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? No, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the carboxylate. But in this case, it's the ester: OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the structure is 4-aminophenyl propionate: benzene with NH2 at position 4, connected to a COOCH2CH2CH3 group.

So molecular formula:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (adds N and H) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (adds C3H6O2).

So C6 + (COOCH2CH2CH3: 3 C) → C9. O: COO has two O, O from ethoxy? No, wait, the ester is OCOCH2CH2CH3, so two O from COO. Plus the benzene's O? No, the benzene is attached via the amino group. Wait, the structure is PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula:

Ph is C6H5. NH2 adds N. COO adds two O and two C (the COO is one C from the acid and one from the ester). Wait, no: COO is from the carboxylic acid. So the structure is NH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene.

So the formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + 1 (COO) + 3 (OCH2CH2CH3) → C6+1+3=10 C. Wait, but target is C9. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let's break it down:

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → C6H7N2?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is phenyl group (C6H5), connected to NH2, which is connected to COOCH2CH2CH3. So the entire molecule is C6H5-NH-COOCH2CH2CH3. So:

Ph (C6H5): 6 C, 5 H.

NH: 1 N, 2 H (since it's NH2? Wait, no. The structure is PhNH2, so Ph-NH2. Then, connected to COOCH2CH2CH3. So the chain is NH2-COOCH2CH2CH3.

So the COOCH2CH2CH3 is three carbons (the propionyl group). So total C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) + 1 (the C from NH2-COO) → 6 +3 +1=10. But our target is C9. So this doesn't match. So option C's formula is C10H13NO3? Let me calculate:

Ph (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

NH2: adds 1 N, 2 H.

COOCH2CH2CH3: adds 3 C, 6 H (since OCH2CH2CH3 has 3*2=6 H), and 2 O.

So overall:

C:6 +3 =9 (since COO is from the NH2-COO- group, so one C from the acid, and two from the ester? Wait, no. The COO is one C (the carbonyl C) and the ester is O-linked to CH2CH2CH3. So COOCH2CH2CH3 has 3 C (the O-connected CH2CH2CH3). So total C:6 (Ph) + 3 (ester) + 1 (COO) =10 C. So formula is C10H? Let's compute H.

Ph has 5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

COOCH2CH2CH3: the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H (each CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3; but the oxygen is connected to the first CH2, so it's O-CH2-CH2-CH3 → that's 2+2+3=7 H). The COO group is O=C-O-, which doesn't add H. So H from COOCH2CH2CH3:7.

The NH2-COO- part: the NH2 has 2 H, and the COO doesn't add any (as it's a carbonyl and an ester O). So total H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (ester) =14. Plus any from the COO part? No. So total H:14. But target is C9H11NO2. So option C's formula is C10H14NO3, which doesn't match. So option C is out.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So structure is PhNH2-COOCH2CH3.

Ph is C6H5. NH2 is attached at position 4. COOCH2CH3 is the ester group.

Molecular formula:

Ph (C6H5) →6 C,5 H.

NH2 → adds 1 N, 2 H.

COOCH2CH3 → adds 2 C (the ethoxy part) and the COO group has one C from the benzoic acid.

Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2 (PhCOOH). Replacing the OH with OCH2CH3 gives C7H6O2 → becomes C9H10O2? Wait, let me compute.

PhCOOCH2CH3: that's C6H5-COOCH2CH3. So C:6 +2 (from ester) +1 (from COO) =9. Wait, no: Ph (6 C) + COO (2 C: one from the acid, one from the ester) → 6+2=8? Wait, the COO is in the benzoate. Let me think:

Benzoate: C6H5COO-. Ester with ethyl: so C6H5COOCH2CH3.

So:

C:6 (Ph) +2 (COO) +2 (ethyl) → 6+2+2=10? Hmm, I'm confused. Let me count the carbons:

Ph →6 C.

COO → 2 C (the C from COO and the O-linked ethyl).

Wait, no: the structure is Ph-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3. So the carbons are:

Ph (6 C) + C from C=O (1 C) + O-CH2CH3 (2 C). So total C:6 +1 +2=9.

O: two from the ester (O in C=O and O in OCH2CH3), plus any others? No, that's two O. N comes from the amine in 4-aminobenzoate. So structure is 4-aminophenyl benzoate? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is PhNH2COOCH2CH3? No, no. Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be PhNH2-COOCH2CH3. So the Ph has NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1 (since benzoate is at position 1). So the formula:

Ph (6 C) + NH2 (1 N) + COOCH2CH3 (3 C: COO has one C, ethyl has two). So total C:6 + 3=9. O: two from COO. H: Let's compute.

Ph has 5 H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt). NH2 contributes 2 H. The COOEt group: OCH2CH3 has 5 H (CH2:2, CH3:3; but attached via O, so O-CH2CH3 → 5 H). The COO group doesn't add H.

So H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) =12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So option D's formula would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match. So that's a problem.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount the H for option D correctly.

Structure: PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is C6H5. But with two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. So the benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). NH2 has 2 H. COOEt group: OCH2CH3 has 5 H. The COO group doesn't add H. So total H:4 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) =11 H. O: two from COO. N: one from NH2. So the formula is C9 (6+3) H11 O2 N. So that matches C9H11NO2. So option D's formula is correct.

So earlier miscalculation was my mistake. So now, options A, D have the correct formula.

Now, looking at the spectroscopic data.

IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. The intensity is medium to strong, which suggests either amide or amine N-H. Amides typically have two N-H stretches (asymmetric and symmetric), but the strong band at 3420 and 3325 could be two N-H stretches, as in an amide. Alternatively, a primary amine would have a broad N-H stretch around 3300-3500, but if it's a secondary amine, the absorption might be different. Wait, but in the options, A is a benzamide (amide), D is a benzoate with an amine group (4-aminophenyl benzoate → which would be a secondary amine? Or is it a primary amine? Wait, 4-aminophenyl benzoate would be PhNH2 attached to a COOEt group. So the amine is primary. So the N-H would be a primary amine, which typically has a broad peak around 3300-3500 cm^-1. But here, two peaks: 3420 and 3325, which could be due to two N-H groups in an amide (asymmetric and symmetric stretching), or possibly an amine with some hydrogen bonding.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. For an ester, the carbonyl is around 1725-1740. For an amide, it's lower, around 1650-1700. So 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but in this case, since we're looking at options with a carbonyl, the ester is more likely. So the 1720 peak suggests ester carbonyl.

So looking at options A and D:

Option A is an amide (benzamide derivative), so the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700 cm-1. But the IR shows 1720, which is higher. So perhaps it's an ester, as in option D.

Option D is an ester, so the 1720 cm-1 would fit. So that suggests option D is more likely.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): triplet, likely an ethyl group's CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, which would be the case for an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So this is probably the ethoxy group's CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet integrating for 2H. This could be the NH2 group, but wait, NH protons usually appear downfield, around 1-5 ppm, but as broad signals. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N. Wait, but in the case of an ethoxy group, the CH2 would be around 4 ppm, but as a quartet. Wait, in the NMR, the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3, and the quartet would be at around 4.0? Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2 is usually around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet. So in option D, the ethoxy group's CH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm. So the NMR shows 4.0 as a quartet (q, 2H). Wait, in the data, it's 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Hmm.

Wait, let me look at the NMR data again:

1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H); → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); → possibly the NH2 protons, but that's a broad signal. Or perhaps something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H); → quartet, 2H. That's probably the CH2 connected to the oxygen in an ester group. Like OCH2CH3, where the CH2 is attached to oxygen. The quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring CH3 (which would be the triplet at 1.20). So this fits with an ethoxy group.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H); 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. For example, if the benzene has substituents in the para positions, the protons adjacent to substituents would split into two doublets. Alternatively, this could be a meta-substitution, but in that case, the splitting might be more complex. Wait, in para substitution, the two protons on one side are equivalent, and the two on the other are equivalent. So each set would be a doublet. So for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like OCH2CH3 and something else, the H NMR would show two doublets.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzene ring has ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1. So the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions. That would make the ring have two substituents not in para positions. So the H NMR would not show two doublets. Instead, it might show a more complex splitting, like a triplet or quartet, depending on substitution pattern. So in this case, the aromatic protons might not be two doublets.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2-COOCH2CH3. The substituents on benzene are NH2 (position 4) and COOEt (position 1). Wait, in this structure, the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. Because NH2 is at position 4 (assuming COOEt is at position 1), so they're para. So the benzene would have two substituents in para positions. The aromatic protons would be the two H adjacent to the NH2 and the two adjacent to the COOEt. But wait, let me draw it:

Positions:

1: COOEt

4: NH2

So the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. The H adjacent to substituent at 1 would be at positions 2 and 6. The H adjacent to substituent at 4 would be at positions 3 and 5. So each pair would be a doublet.

So the H NMR would show two doublets, one for the H next to COOEt and another next to NH2.

Wait, but in reality, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, so the aromatic protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt) would be a pair, and at 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2) would be another pair. So they would each be doublets, which fits the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So that matches.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm doublet would be the H ortho to COOEt, and the 8.0 ppm would be H ortho to NH2.

Now, looking back at the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (bs, 2H). What could that be? If the molecule has an NH2 group, the protons would typically appear as a broad peak. NH2 protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, but in this case, at 4.0 ppm. But in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has a primary amine (PhNH2), so the NH2 protons would show up as a broad signal. However, in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H, which matches the NH2 group.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, and the amine has two H. So that fits. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2 from the ethoxy group. So the ethoxy in the ester would have the CH2 as a quartet coupling with the CH3 as triplet. The CH2 would be around 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 at 1.20 ppm. That matches.

So putting it all together:

IR shows strong ester carbonyl at 1720, which fits option D (ester). The N-H in D is a primary amine, which would give a broad peak around 4.0 ppm, which matches the NMR.

In the aromatic region, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm suggest para-substituted benzene, which is the case for D.

Option A is an amide, which would have a lower carbonyl stretch (around 1680), but the IR shows 1720, which is higher, more consistent with an ester. So option A is less likely.

So the correct answer should be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, the spectroscopic data and the options provided were analyzed systematically.

### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)
The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 9 + 2 - 11 - 2 - 1)}{2} = 3
\]

This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) is unlikely, as it exceeds the calculated DoU. However, the IR and NMR data indicate the presence of a benzene ring with substituents.

---

### IR Analysis
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Medium to strong bands, likely N-H stretches, consistent with either an amide or a primary amine.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong band, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester (ester carbonyls typically appear around 1720 cm⁻¹).

This suggests the compound contains both a carbonyl group and an N-H group.

---

### 1H NMR Analysis
The NMR data is as follows:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely the CH3 group of an ethoxy group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely the NH2 group of a primary amine.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, consistent with the CH2 group of an ethoxy group.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### Option Analysis
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- **Structure**: Benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- **Molecular Formula**: C9H11NO2 (matches).
- **IR**: Amides typically show N-H stretches (asymmetric and symmetric) and a carbonyl stretch around 1680–1700 cm⁻¹. However, the IR data shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more consistent with an ester than an amide.
- **NMR**: The substitution pattern (ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1) would not produce two simple doublets for the aromatic protons. This does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- **Structure**: Formamide with an ethoxy group at position 4.
- **Molecular Formula**: C9H12NO2 (does not match the given formula).
- **Conclusion**: The molecular formula mismatch eliminates this option.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- **Structure**: Aminophenyl group attached to a propionate ester.
- **Molecular Formula**: C10H13NO3 (does not match the given formula).
- **Conclusion**: The molecular formula mismatch eliminates this option.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- **Structure**: Ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid.
- **Molecular Formula**: C9H11NO2 (matches).
- **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an ester. The N-H stretches at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are consistent with a primary amine.
- **NMR**:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Matches the CH3 group of the ethoxy group.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Matches the NH2 group of the primary amine.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Matches the CH2 group of the ethoxy group.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Matches the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene ring (COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4).
- **Conclusion**: The IR and NMR data fully support this option.

---

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem where I need to identify the compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (two oxygen atoms), y=1 (one nitrogen). Plugging in: (2*9 + 2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So DoU is 3. That could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus maybe a double bond or ring. Hmm, wait, benzene is three double bonds, so that's 4 DoU? Let me think again. Benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So each double bond is one DoU, but the ring itself is another. Wait, no, each ring or double bond is a DoU. So a benzene ring is three DoU: three double bonds. Wait no, each double bond is one, and each ring is another. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring? No, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So each double bond is a DoU, and the ring itself is another. So benzene has 4 DoU. But wait, if a molecule has a benzene ring, then the DoU from it would be 4. So if our compound has a benzene ring, which uses 4 of the 3 available DoU, that's a problem because 4>3. So maybe the benzene isn't the main contributor? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the DoU. The formula is C9H11NO2.

DoU = (2*9 +2 - 11 - 2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2= 3. So 3 DoU.

So if the compound has a benzene ring, that's 4 DoU, which is more than 3. So benzene can't be present. Wait, but that's confusing because the IR shows strong absorption around 3420 and 3325, which are indicative of N-H stretches, possibly amide or amine groups. And the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe ester or amide.

Wait, but if benzene isn't possible, maybe it's a substituted aromatic ring, but that requires 4 DoU. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound has a benzene ring plus a substituent that's a double bond or another ring. But that would require more DoU. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzene with something else. Let me think of the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has a benzene ring (4 DoU), and the carbonyl group (1 DoU), but that would sum to 5, which is way over the DoU of 3. So that can't be right. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2, so molecular formula is C7H7NO. Hmm, but our compound is C9H11NO2. So that would imply substituents. Let me check the molecular formulas of the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: Benzoic acid amide with an ethoxy group. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with NH2 would give C7H5NO2, but adding an ethoxy group would add C2H5, making it C9H10NO2. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps the structure is C6H5-O-C2H5 attached to another group. Wait, maybe I should compute the molecular formulas for each option.

Let me calculate each option's molecular formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2 (benzene ring, CONH2). Adding an ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C7 (from benzamide) + C2H5O (ethoxy) → so C9H10NO2? Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2 → C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group: OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C7 + C2H5O: So C9H10O2N? Wait, but our target is C9H11NO2, so perhaps the H count is off. Let me think: benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group would substitute a hydrogen on the benzene ring. So the formula would become C9H9NO2? Because benzamide is C7H7NO2: benzamide is C6H5-CONH2, which is C7H5NO2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write out the structures:

3-ethoxybenzamide is benzamide (PhCONH2) with an OCH2CH3 group at position 3. So the benzene has two substituents: OCH2CH3 and CONH2. So the molecular formula would be C6H5 (but with two substituents: OCH2CH3 and CONH2). So each substituent adds their own atoms.

Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 is C2H5O. CONH2 is C O N2 H2. Wait, wait: Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 adds 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens (since O is linked). CONH2 is one C, one O, two N, two H. So adding all together:

C6 + C2 (from ethoxy) + C1 (from CONH2) = 9 C. O is 2 (one from CONH2, one from ethoxy). N is 1 (from CONH2). Hydrogen: benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 takes one H, and CONH2 takes another; wait, benzene has five H in total when two substituents are present? No, benzene with two substituents would have four H. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me compute the molecular formula correctly.

3-Ethoxybenzamide: structure is O
           |
OCH2CH3-C6H4-CONH2

So the formula would be C6 (from benzene) + 2 C (ethoxy) + 2 C (from CONH2) → Wait, no. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group would add C2H5O. So molecular formula would be:

C7 (from benzamide) + C2H5O → C9 H11 O2 N? Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C9 H12 O3 N? But that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's C6H5-O-C2H5 connected to a CONH2, which is C6H5-O-C2H5-CONH2. So the formula is C6 + O (from O) + C2 (from ethoxy) + C (from CONH2) + N2 (from CONH2) + Hs.

Wait, let me compute:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide CO) = 9 C.

H: Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and CONH2). Each substituent takes one H each. So 5 H. Then, OCH2CH3 has 5 H (since the oxygen is connected to CH2CH3, which has 2 and 3 H, but the oxygen is connected to the CH2, so that group has 5 H. Plus the amide group: CONH2 has two H. So total H: 5 (benzene) +5 (ethoxy) +2 (amide) = 12? But molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: O
           |
OCH2CH3-C6H4-CONH2.

So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (CONH2) → Wait, CONH2 is one C. So total C is 6+2+2? No, CONH2 is one C. So 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide) =9 C. Correct.

Hydrogen: Benzene has 4 H (two substituents), ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), and amide has 2 H (NH2). So 4 +5 +2 =11 H. O: ethoxy has one O, amide has one O. So 2 O. N: one N from amide. So that's C9H11NO2. So yes, option A's formula matches.

So that's possible.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

Formamide is HCONR2. So structure would be HCO-NH-Ph-OCH2CH3, attached at the 4 position.

Molecular formula:

Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 adds 2C, 5H, 1O. HCONH adds H, C, O, N.

So:

Ph (C6) + ethoxy (C2) + HCONH (C2? Wait, HCONH is one C, one O, one N. So total C:6+2+1=9. O: ethoxy (1) + formamide (1) =2. N: 1. H: Let's see. Benzene with substituents: two substituents (ethoxy and formamide) → 4 H on benzene. Ethoxy has 5 H. Formamide: HCONH has the H from HCO, and the NH has two H. So wait, HCONH: HCO-NH-... So HCONH would have H from HCO and H from NH. So HCO has one H, NH has two H. So 3 H. So total H:4 (benzene) +5 (ethoxy) +3 (formamide) =12. But molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. So Option B's formula would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match. So Option B is out.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH3.

Ph is C6H5. Propionate is OCO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? No, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the carboxylate. But in this case, it's the ester: OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the structure is 4-aminophenyl propionate: benzene with NH2 at position 4, connected to a COOCH2CH2CH3 group.

So molecular formula:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (adds N and H) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (adds C3H6O2).

So C6 + (COOCH2CH2CH3: 3 C) → C9. O: COO has two O, O from ethoxy? No, wait, the ester is OCOCH2CH2CH3, so two O from COO. Plus the benzene's O? No, the benzene is attached via the amino group. Wait, the structure is PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula:

Ph is C6H5. NH2 adds N. COO adds two O and two C (the COO is one C from the acid and one from the ester). Wait, no: COO is from the carboxylic acid. So the structure is NH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene.

So the formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + 1 (COO) + 3 (OCH2CH2CH3) → C6+1+3=10 C. Wait, but target is C9. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let's break it down:

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → C6H7N2?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is phenyl group (C6H5), connected to NH2, which is connected to COOCH2CH2CH3. So the entire molecule is C6H5-NH-COOCH2CH2CH3. So:

Ph (C6H5): 6 C, 5 H.

NH: 1 N, 2 H (since it's NH2? Wait, no. The structure is PhNH2, so Ph-NH2. Then, connected to COOCH2CH2CH3. So the chain is NH2-COOCH2CH2CH3.

So the COOCH2CH2CH3 is three carbons (the propionyl group). So total C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) + 1 (the C from NH2-COO) → 6 +3 +1=10. But our target is C9. So this doesn't match. So option C's formula is C10H13NO3? Let me calculate:

Ph (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

NH2: adds 1 N, 2 H.

COOCH2CH2CH3: adds 3 C, 6 H (since OCH2CH2CH3 has 3*2=6 H), and 2 O.

So overall:

C:6 +3 =9 (since COO is from the NH2-COO- group, so one C from the acid, and two from the ester? Wait, no. The COO is one C (the carbonyl C) and the ester is O-linked to CH2CH2CH3. So COOCH2CH2CH3 has 3 C (the O-connected CH2CH2CH3). So total C:6 (Ph) + 3 (ester) + 1 (COO) =10 C. So formula is C10H? Let's compute H.

Ph has 5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

COOCH2CH2CH3: the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H (each CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3; but the oxygen is connected to the first CH2, so it's O-CH2-CH2-CH3 → that's 2+2+3=7 H). The COO group is O=C-O-, which doesn't add H. So H from COOCH2CH2CH3:7.

The NH2-COO- part: the NH2 has 2 H, and the COO doesn't add any (as it's a carbonyl and an ester O). So total H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (ester) =14. Plus any from the COO part? No. So total H:14. But target is C9H11NO2. So option C's formula is C10H14NO3, which doesn't match. So option C is out.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So structure is PhNH2-COOCH2CH3.

Ph is C6H5. NH2 is attached at position 4. COOCH2CH3 is the ester group.

Molecular formula:

Ph (C6H5) →6 C,5 H.

NH2 → adds 1 N, 2 H.

COOCH2CH3 → adds 2 C (the ethoxy part) and the COO group has one C from the benzoic acid.

Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2 (PhCOOH). Replacing the OH with OCH2CH3 gives C7H6O2 → becomes C9H10O2? Wait, let me compute.

PhCOOCH2CH3: that's C6H5-COOCH2CH3. So C:6 +2 (from ester) +1 (from COO) =9. Wait, no: Ph (6 C) + COO (2 C: one from the acid, one from the ester) → 6+2=8? Wait, the COO is in the benzoate. Let me think:

Benzoate: C6H5COO-. Ester with ethyl: so C6H5COOCH2CH3.

So:

C:6 (Ph) +2 (COO) +2 (ethyl) → 6+2+2=10? Hmm, I'm confused. Let me count the carbons:

Ph →6 C.

COO → 2 C (the C from COO and the O-linked ethyl).

Wait, no: the structure is Ph-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3. So the carbons are:

Ph (6 C) + C from C=O (1 C) + O-CH2CH3 (2 C). So total C:6 +1 +2=9.

O: two from the ester (O in C=O and O in OCH2CH3), plus any others? No, that's two O. N comes from the amine in 4-aminobenzoate. So structure is 4-aminophenyl benzoate? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is PhNH2COOCH2CH3? No, no. Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be PhNH2-COOCH2CH3. So the Ph has NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1 (since benzoate is at position 1). So the formula:

Ph (6 C) + NH2 (1 N) + COOCH2CH3 (3 C: COO has one C, ethyl has two). So total C:6 + 3=9. O: two from COO. H: Let's compute.

Ph has 5 H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt). NH2 contributes 2 H. The COOEt group: OCH2CH3 has 5 H (CH2:2, CH3:3; but attached via O, so O-CH2CH3 → 5 H). The COO group doesn't add H.

So H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) =12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So option D's formula would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match. So that's a problem.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount the H for option D correctly.

Structure: PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is C6H5. But with two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. So the benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). NH2 has 2 H. COOEt group: OCH2CH3 has 5 H. The COO group doesn't add H. So total H:4 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) =11 H. O: two from COO. N: one from NH2. So the formula is C9 (6+3) H11 O2 N. So that matches C9H11NO2. So option D's formula is correct.

So earlier miscalculation was my mistake. So now, options A, D have the correct formula.

Now, looking at the spectroscopic data.

IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. The intensity is medium to strong, which suggests either amide or amine N-H. Amides typically have two N-H stretches (asymmetric and symmetric), but the strong band at 3420 and 3325 could be two N-H stretches, as in an amide. Alternatively, a primary amine would have a broad N-H stretch around 3300-3500, but if it's a secondary amine, the absorption might be different. Wait, but in the options, A is a benzamide (amide), D is a benzoate with an amine group (4-aminophenyl benzoate → which would be a secondary amine? Or is it a primary amine? Wait, 4-aminophenyl benzoate would be PhNH2 attached to a COOEt group. So the amine is primary. So the N-H would be a primary amine, which typically has a broad peak around 3300-3500 cm^-1. But here, two peaks: 3420 and 3325, which could be due to two N-H groups in an amide (asymmetric and symmetric stretching), or possibly an amine with some hydrogen bonding.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. For an ester, the carbonyl is around 1725-1740. For an amide, it's lower, around 1650-1700. So 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but in this case, since we're looking at options with a carbonyl, the ester is more likely. So the 1720 peak suggests ester carbonyl.

So looking at options A and D:

Option A is an amide (benzamide derivative), so the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700 cm-1. But the IR shows 1720, which is higher. So perhaps it's an ester, as in option D.

Option D is an ester, so the 1720 cm-1 would fit. So that suggests option D is more likely.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): triplet, likely an ethyl group's CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, which would be the case for an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So this is probably the ethoxy group's CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet integrating for 2H. This could be the NH2 group, but wait, NH protons usually appear downfield, around 1-5 ppm, but as broad signals. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N. Wait, but in the case of an ethoxy group, the CH2 would be around 4 ppm, but as a quartet. Wait, in the NMR, the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3, and the quartet would be at around 4.0? Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2 is usually around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet. So in option D, the ethoxy group's CH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm. So the NMR shows 4.0 as a quartet (q, 2H). Wait, in the data, it's 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Hmm.

Wait, let me look at the NMR data again:

1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H); → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); → possibly the NH2 protons, but that's a broad signal. Or perhaps something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H); → quartet, 2H. That's probably the CH2 connected to the oxygen in an ester group. Like OCH2CH3, where the CH2 is attached to oxygen. The quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring CH3 (which would be the triplet at 1.20). So this fits with an ethoxy group.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H); 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. For example, if the benzene has substituents in the para positions, the protons adjacent to substituents would split into two doublets. Alternatively, this could be a meta-substitution, but in that case, the splitting might be more complex. Wait, in para substitution, the two protons on one side are equivalent, and the two on the other are equivalent. So each set would be a doublet. So for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like OCH2CH3 and something else, the H NMR would show two doublets.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzene ring has ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1. So the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions. That would make the ring have two substituents not in para positions. So the H NMR would not show two doublets. Instead, it might show a more complex splitting, like a triplet or quartet, depending on substitution pattern. So in this case, the aromatic protons might not be two doublets.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2-COOCH2CH3. The substituents on benzene are NH2 (position 4) and COOEt (position 1). Wait, in this structure, the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. Because NH2 is at position 4 (assuming COOEt is at position 1), so they're para. So the benzene would have two substituents in para positions. The aromatic protons would be the two H adjacent to the NH2 and the two adjacent to the COOEt. But wait, let me draw it:

Positions:

1: COOEt

4: NH2

So the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. The H adjacent to substituent at 1 would be at positions 2 and 6. The H adjacent to substituent at 4 would be at positions 3 and 5. So each pair would be a doublet.

So the H NMR would show two doublets, one for the H next to COOEt and another next to NH2.

Wait, but in reality, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, so the aromatic protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt) would be a pair, and at 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2) would be another pair. So they would each be doublets, which fits the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So that matches.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm doublet would be the H ortho to COOEt, and the 8.0 ppm would be H ortho to NH2.

Now, looking back at the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (bs, 2H). What could that be? If the molecule has an NH2 group, the protons would typically appear as a broad peak. NH2 protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, but in this case, at 4.0 ppm. But in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has a primary amine (PhNH2), so the NH2 protons would show up as a broad signal. However, in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H, which matches the NH2 group.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, and the amine has two H. So that fits. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2 from the ethoxy group. So the ethoxy in the ester would have the CH2 as a quartet coupling with the CH3 as triplet. The CH2 would be around 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 at 1.20 ppm. That matches.

So putting it all together:

IR shows strong ester carbonyl at 1720, which fits option D (ester). The N-H in D is a primary amine, which would give a broad peak around 4.0 ppm, which matches the NMR.

In the aromatic region, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm suggest para-substituted benzene, which is the case for D.

Option A is an amide, which would have a lower carbonyl stretch (around 1680), but the IR shows 1720, which is higher, more consistent with an ester. So option A is less likely.

So the correct answer should be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, the spectroscopic data and the options provided were analyzed systematically.

### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)
The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 9 + 2 - 11 - 2 - 1)}{2} = 3
\]

This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) is unlikely, as it exceeds the calculated DoU. However, the IR and NMR data indicate the presence of a benzene ring with substituents.

---

### IR Analysis
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Medium to strong bands, likely N-H stretches, consistent with either an amide or a primary amine.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong band, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester (ester carbonyls typically appear around 1720 cm⁻¹).

This suggests the compound contains both a carbonyl group and an N-H group.

---

### 1H NMR Analysis
The NMR data is as follows:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely the CH3 group of an ethoxy group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely the NH2 group of a primary amine.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, consistent with the CH2 group of an ethoxy group.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### Final Answer

**Answer: D**
