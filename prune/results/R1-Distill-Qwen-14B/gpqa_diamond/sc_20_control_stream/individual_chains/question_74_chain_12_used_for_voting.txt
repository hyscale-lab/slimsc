Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. I've studied a bit about this before, but I need to think carefully.

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, I'm assuming that means 32% chance of decaying in that time frame. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the setup right. So, the initial statement is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That probably refers to the half-life or something related to exponential decay. But wait, 32% is not a typical fraction for a half-life. The half-life is the time when half the atoms have decayed. If 32% decay in 100 minutes, that doesn't fit the half-life because, for example, the half-life is when 50% have decayed. Hmm, maybe 32% is the probability in 100 minutes from the start.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the exponential decay formula. So, the decay probability in a given time is modeled as P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But wait, the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, perhaps P=0.32 when t=100.

So, first, I can find the decay constant λ. From P = 1 - e^(-λt), solving for λ:

λ = - (ln(1 - P)) / t

Substituting P=0.32 and t=100:

λ = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857. So λ is about 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

But wait, another approach: Maybe the decay is following an exponential decay law, so the number of undecayed nuclei is N(t)=N0 e^(-λt), so the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). So yes, that's correct.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait. The next 150 minutes is from the current time. So the atom has already survived 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150. So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes since the start. But the survival probability up to 200 minutes is e^(-λ * 200). But since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the probability that it will survive the next 150 minutes is e^(-λ *150) multiplied by the fact that it's already been 50 minutes.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt). So, up to 50 minutes, the survival probability is e^(-λ *50). Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So that would be the survival probability at t=50 minus the survival probability at t=200.

So P_decay_next = [1 - e^(-λ *50)] - [1 - e^(-λ *200)] = e^(-λ *200) - e^(-λ *50).

Alternatively, since it's given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [P(decays between 50 and 200) ] / [P(survives the first 50 minutes)].

But wait, in radioactive decay, the probability is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of how long it's been since the start. Because the decay process has no memory of previous events.

So, maybe the answer is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start, which is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but the given initial condition is that the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, so λ is known. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, but considering that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.

Alternatively, maybe the way to approach it is to compute the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Since the decay is memoryless, the conditional probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in t minutes from the start, regardless of how long it's been.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, then let's compute that. So first, find λ.

We know that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100)

So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → -λ *100 = ln(0.68) → λ = (- ln(0.68)) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. So λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, compute the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (since the memoryless property means it's as if we're starting fresh in terms of decay probability, given that it hasn't decayed yet).

So P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute that:

λ *150 = 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5613.

So P = 1 - 0.5613 ≈ 0.4387, which is approximately 43.87%, so around 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the 32% is the probability per 100 minutes, and after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150. So perhaps the way to think about it is the total time is 200 minutes, but that's not how I approached it before. Oh, but that's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the 32% is the probability in the first 100 minutes, and after 50 minutes, I need to compute the probability between t=50 and t=200.

So, the survival probability at t=50 is e^(-λ *50), and at t=200 is e^(-λ *200).

So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)].

Wait, no. Because the probability of decaying by t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So the probability of decaying between t1 and t2 is (1 - e^(-λ t2)) - (1 - e^(-λ t1)) ), which is e^(-λ t1) - e^(-λ t2).

But in this case, t1 is 50, t2 is 200.

So P = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Let me compute that.

λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Compute e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831) ≈ 0.8253.

e^(-λ *200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) ≈ 0.4613.

So P = 0.8253 - 0.4613 ≈ 0.364, which is 36.4%. But that's not one of the options. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, why? Because I think I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. So t=50 to t=200 (150 minutes). So the correct way is to compute the probability as:

P = [1 - e^(-λ*(50+150)) ] - [1 - e^(-λ*50) ].

Which is the same as e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Wait, but earlier I calculated that to be about 0.364, which isn't an option. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the decay constant. Let me re-calculate.

Given that P = 0.32 in 100 minutes, so:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100)

So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

Take natural log on both sides: -λ *100 = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662.

So λ = 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

That seems correct.

So, for the 150 minutes after 50, the time from start is 200 minutes. So t = 200.

Compute e^(-λ *200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) ≈ e^(-0.7713) ≈ approx 0.4613.

Wait, e^(-0.7713) is about 0.4613?

Wait, e^(-0.7) is about 0.4966. e^(-0.77) would be a bit lower. Let me compute 0.7713.

Alternatively, using calculator-like approximations:

ln(0.46) ≈ -0.7709. Oh, because e^(-0.7709) ≈ 0.46. So yes, e^(-0.7713) ≈ 0.46.

So, e^(-λ *50) is e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831). e^(-0.1928) ≈ around 0.8253.

So, P(decay between 50 and 200) = 0.8253 - 0.4613 = 0.364 or 36.4%. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the process is memoryless, the probability after 50 minutes is the same as starting fresh for the next 150 minutes.

Wait, that would give P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ *150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5613.

So P = 1 - 0.5613 = 0.4387 or 43.87%, which is about 44% as before.

But that's option A.

So, which approach is correct? The first approach gives 36%, which isn't an option. The second approach gives about 44%, which is option A.

But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, the key point is whether the decay probability is additive over time. Because radioactive decay is a Poisson process with independent events, the conditional probability after t1 time that the atom decays in the next t2 time is the same as the probability of decaying in any t2 time interval, regardless of t1.

So the correct approach is to calculate it as 1 - e^(-λ t2), where t2 is the next 150 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is about 44%, which is option A.

So, the answer should be A) 44%.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom decaying in a given time is modeled as:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so we can calculate \( \lambda \) as follows:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). Thus, we calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.5613
\]

\[
P = 1 - 0.5613 \approx 0.4387 \, \text{or} \, 43.87\%.
\]

This rounds to approximately 44%. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is **44%**, which corresponds to option A.

So, first, I can find the decay constant λ. From P = 1 - e^(-λt), solving for λ:

λ = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857. So λ is about 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait. The next 150 minutes is from the current time. So the atom has already survived 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150. So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes since the start. But the survival probability up to 200 minutes is e^(-λ * 200). But since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the probability that it will survive the next 150 minutes is e^(-λ *150) multiplied by the fact that it's already been 50 minutes.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt). So, up to 50 minutes, the survival probability is e^(-λ *50). Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So that would be the survival probability at t=50 minus the survival probability at t=200.

So P_decay_next = [1 - e^(-λ *50)] - [1 - e^(-λ *200)] = e^(-λ *200) - e^(-λ *50).

Alternatively, since it's given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [P(decays between 50 and 200) ] / [P(survives the first 50 minutes)].

But wait, in radioactive decay, the probability is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of how long it's been since the start. Because the decay process has no memory of previous events.

So, maybe the answer is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start, which is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but the given initial condition is that the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, so λ is known. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, but considering that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.

Alternatively, maybe the way to approach it is to compute the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Since the decay is memoryless, the conditional probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in t minutes from the start, regardless of how long it's been.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, then let's compute that. So first, find λ.

We know that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100)

So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → -λ *100 = ln(0.68) → λ = (- ln(0.68)) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. So λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, compute the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (since the memoryless property means it's as if we're starting fresh in terms of decay probability, given that it hasn't decayed yet).

So P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute that:

λ *150 = 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5613.

So P = 1 - 0.5613 ≈ 0.4387, which is approximately 43.87%, so around 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the 32% is the probability per 100 minutes, and after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150. So perhaps the way to think about it is the total time is 200 minutes, but that's not how I approached it before. Oh, but that's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the 32% is the probability in the first 100 minutes, and after 50 minutes, I need to compute the probability between t=50 and t=200.

So, the survival probability at t=50 is e^(-λ *50), and at t=200 is e^(-λ *200).

So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)].

Wait, no. Because the probability of decaying by t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So the probability of decaying between t1 and t2 is (1 - e^(-λ t2)) - (1 - e^(-λ t1)) ), which is e^(-λ t1) - e^(-λ t2).

But in this case, t1 is 50, t2 is 200.

So P = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Let me compute that.

λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Compute e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831) ≈ 0.8253.

e^(-λ *200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) ≈ 0.4613.

So P = 0.8253 - 0.4613 ≈ 0.364, which is 36.4%. But that's not one of the options. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, why? Because I think I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. So t=50 to t=200 (150 minutes). So the correct way is to compute the probability as:

P = [1 - e^(-λ*(50+150)) ] - [1 - e^(-λ*50) ].

Which is the same as e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Wait, but earlier I calculated that to be about 0.364, which isn't an option. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the decay constant. Let me re-calculate.

Given that P = 0.32 in 100 minutes, so:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100)

So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

Take natural log on both sides: -λ *100 = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662.

So λ = 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

That seems correct.

So, for the 150 minutes after 50, the time from start is 200 minutes. So t = 200.

Compute e^(-λ *200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) ≈ e^(-0.7713) ≈ approx 0.4613.

Wait, e^(-0.7713) is about 0.4613?

Wait, e^(-0.7) is about 0.4966. e^(-0.77) would be a bit lower. Let me compute 0.7713.

Alternatively, using calculator-like approximations:

ln(0.46) ≈ -0.7709. Oh, because e^(-0.7709) ≈ 0.46. So yes, e^(-0.7713) ≈ 0.46.

So, e^(-λ *50) is e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831). e^(-0.1928) ≈ around 0.8253.

So, P(decay between 50 and 200) = 0.8253 - 0.4613 = 0.364 or 36.4%. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the process is memoryless, the probability after 50 minutes is the same as starting fresh for the next 150 minutes.

Wait, that would give P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ *150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5613.

So P = 1 - 0.5613 = 0.4387 or 43.87%, which is about 44% as before.

But that's option A.

So, which approach is correct? The first approach gives 36%, which isn't an option. The second approach gives about 44%, which is option A.

But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, the key point is whether the decay probability is additive over time. Because radioactive decay is a Poisson process with independent events, the conditional probability after t1 time that the atom decays in the next t2 time is the same as the probability of decaying in any t2 time interval, regardless of t1.

So the correct approach is to calculate it as 1 - e^(-λ t2), where t2 is the next 150 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is about 44%, which is option A.

So, the answer should be A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom decaying in a given time is modeled as:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so we can calculate \( \lambda \) as follows:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). Thus, we calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.5613
\]

\[
P = 1 - 0.5613 \approx 0.4387 \, \text{or} \, 43.87\%.
\]

This rounds to approximately 44%. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is **44%**, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
