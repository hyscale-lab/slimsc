Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is a way to count the number of rings plus double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me try to draw this structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is such that the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 because it's cyclohex-3-ene. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 in the ring.

Wait, no, actually, cyclohexene is usually numbered so that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, but the numbering can vary based on substituents. Hmm, but the name here is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

So, the ring is cyclohexene, which already has a double bond. So, in the ring, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, maybe? Wait, no. The numbering goes such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. So, the ring has a double bond, which is one degree of unsaturation.

Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (-CHO). And at position 5, there's a vinyl group (-CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). Wait, no, vinyl is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached. So, the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, which is an alkene, so that's another double bond.

Wait, let me count the double bonds in the starting material. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond (1), the vinyl group has another double bond (2). Also, the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is another double bond (3). Oh wait, so the starting molecule has three double bonds, right? But wait, the cyclohexene has one, vinyl has another, and formyl has a third. So that's three double bonds. So the index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting material is 3 + any rings. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one ring and one double bond. Wait, no, the ring itself is a six-membered ring that's a cyclohexene, so that ring has one double bond, making it a ring plus a double bond. Wait, no, the index counts each ring and each double bond as one each. So a cyclohexene ring is a ring (counts as 1) and has a double bond (counts as 1), but wait, wait no. Wait, the cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond. So the ring itself is a structure that already includes a double bond. So the ring contributes 1, the double bond in the ring is part of the ring's structure, so maybe I'm overcounting.

Wait, no. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, N is nitrogen. But perhaps I should think in terms of the structure.

Alternatively, the index is the sum of the number of rings and double bonds. So, for the starting material:

- The cyclohexene ring has one double bond and is a six-membered ring. Wait, no, the ring is a cyclohexene, which is a cyclohexane with a double bond, so the ring itself doesn't add to the double bond count beyond the ring's structure. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's one double bond (from the ring), plus any substituents. The substituent at position 2 is a formyl group (-CHO), which has a double bond (carbonyl). The substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?), no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached. So the vinyl group has a double bond. So the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (1), formyl group (2), and vinyl group (3). So the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 3 plus any rings. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, which is a single ring. So the index would be 3 (from double bonds) + 1 (from the ring) = 4? Or is the cyclohexene's double bond considered part of the ring, so the ring contributes one to the index (the ring itself is a single ring and the double bond is part of the ring's structure, so it doesn't add an extra double bond). Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring has one double bond, so it's a cyclohexene. So the ring contributes one to the index (as a ring). But the double bond within the ring is part of the ring structure, so it doesn't add an extra. So the substituents are a formyl and a vinyl group. So the formyl group has a carbonyl (one double bond), the vinyl group has another double bond.

So total double bonds: formyl (1), vinyl (1). The cyclohexene's double bond is part of the ring, so each ring and each double bond (not part of a ring) contribute.

Wait, but the index calculation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Maybe I should calculate it that way to avoid confusion.

Let me count the carbons, hydrogens, etc.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is:

- A cyclohexene ring: that's 6 carbons in the ring.

- The substituents: at position 2, a formyl group (-CHO), which has one carbon (the aldehyde group).

- At position 5, a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?), no, wait, vinyl is -CH2-CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached, so the vinyl group is a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, no. The vinyl group is -CH2-CH2-? No, wait, no. The vinyl group is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond: actually, it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the vinyl group adds two carbons, with a double bond between them.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring is 6 carbons, the formyl is 1 carbon (CHO), the vinyl is 2 carbons (CH2=CH-), and the carboxylic acid is another group. Wait, the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3. So the ring has substituents at 2 (CHO), 3 (COOH), and 5 (vinyl, CH2=CH-).

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify the structure.

The base structure is cyclohex-3-ene. So the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming positions 1-6 in the ring). So position 3 is connected to position 4 via a double bond.

Then, substituents are:

- At position 2: a formyl group (-CHO).

- At position 5: a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?), noâ€”vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's attached to the ring.

Wait, but the substituent is at position 5, so the ring has a vinyl group attached at C5.

So the molecule is:

Cyclohexene ring: C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6, with a double bond between C3 and C4.

At C2: -CHO (formyl group).

At C5: -CH2-CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent at C5 is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So that's a double bond.

So the total structure has:

- Cyclohexene ring (1 ring, but the double bond is part of the ring, so it's one ring and one double bond? Or is the ring considered to have the double bond, so it's a single unit contributing to the index as a ring and a double bond? No, the index counts each ring and each double bond as separate. Wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond, so it contributes two to the index (one for the ring, one for the double bond). But wait, that's not correct. The index is the sum of the number of rings and the number of double bonds. So a cyclohexene ring (one ring) plus one double bond (from the ring's structure) would contribute 2 to the index. But wait, no. Wait, the ring structure already includes the double bond as part of its structure. So the cyclohexene has a ring (which contributes 1 to the index) and a double bond (another 1), so total 2. But wait, no. Wait, the ring itself is a single unit. Each ring counts as one, each double bond (including those in rings) counts as one. So, for instance, cyclopropane has one ring, no double bonds, so index 1. Cyclopropene (a three-membered ring with a double bond) has two rings? No, cyclopropene is a three-membered ring with a double bond, so index would be 2 (one ring, one double bond).

So in the starting molecule, the cyclohexene has a ring (1) and a double bond (1), so that's two. Then, the substituents: formyl group has a double bond (CHO), and the vinyl group has another double bond (CH2=CH-). So the substituents add two more double bonds. So total index is 2 (from ring and double bond in the ring) + 2 (from substituents) = 4.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formyl group is -CHO. That's a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a double bond. So that's one. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is another double bond. So the substituents contribute two double bonds.

So the starting molecule has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond (so index += 2).

- Substituents: formyl (1 double bond), vinyl (1 double bond): index += 2.

Total index: 2 + 2 = 4.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Wait, the starting molecule's formula would be C8H6O3? Because:

- The cyclohexene ring is C6H8. But wait, no. Wait, a cyclohexene is C6H8? No, wait, cyclohexene would be C6H10 if it's a six-membered ring with a double bond. Wait, no. Wait, for a cyclohexane, it's C6H12. If you have a double bond, it loses two hydrogens, so C6H10. But when substituents are added, they can affect the count.

But perhaps I should compute the index using the formula method.

The formula for index (IHD) is:

IHD = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

In this case, X (halogens) and N (nitrogen) are zero.

So, let's find the molecular formula of the starting material.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: 6 carbons.

- Formyl group: CHO (1 C).

- Vinyl group: CH2=CH- (2 C).

- Carboxylic acid: COOH (which is -CO2H, so 2 O and 2 O in the formula, but the carbons are part of the ring or substituents. Wait, the COOH is at position 3, so it's part of the ring's substituent.

So the total number of carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (carboxylic acid's COOH is part of the ring's substituent, but wait, no. Wait, the carboxylic acid is -COOH, which is a substituent on the ring. So the ring has a COOH group, which is -COOH (so 2 carbons: the one attached to the ring and the oxygen). Wait, no, the COOH group is (COOH), which is -C(O)OH, so it's one carbon attached to the ring, with two oxygen atoms.

So the total carbons are: 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 carbons.

Wait, no. Wait, the ring is 6 carbons. The substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (COOH), and 5 (vinyl, which is CH2=CH-). So the substituents add 1 (CHO) + 1 (COOH's C) + 2 (vinyl's CH2 and CH2) = 4 carbons added. So total C is 6 + 4 = 10.

Hydrogens: Let's see. The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons and, normally, 10 H. But with substituents, it's less.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count all the H in the molecule.

The starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The structure is:

- The ring: cyclohexene (6 C, 8 H?), but with substituents.

Wait, let's think of each substituent:

- At position 2: CHO (formyl group). The CHO has one carbon (the aldehyde), which is attached to the ring. The aldehyde group has one H (RCHO: the aldehyde H).

- At position 3: COOH (carboxylic acid). The COOH group is -C(O)OH. So, that would have two oxygen atoms, but the H is the acidic H.

- At position 5: vinyl group, which is CH2=CH-. So each vinyl group has two carbons. The vinyl group is attached to the ring at position 5.

Now, the cyclohexene ring: the ring has a double bond (so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond). So, the number of H in the ring would be 6 (since each carbon in the ring, considering the substituents and double bonds, would have varying H).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the degree of unsaturation formula.

The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

So for the starting material, let's get the formula.

The starting molecule is:

- 6 carbons in the ring (cyclohexene).

- 1 C from formyl group (CHO).

- 2 C from vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

- 1 C from COOH (the one attached to the ring).

Wait, no. Wait, COOH is a substituent on the ring. So the COOH is -COOH, which has one carbon attached to the ring, and then two O's. So the COOH adds one carbon.

So total C: 6 +1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) = 10 C.

Hydrogens: Let's count.

- The cyclohexene ring (before substituents) would have 6 C and, considering the double bond, 6 H in the ring (since each CH2 in a cyclohexane is 2 H, but with a double bond, two CH groups, so more H? Wait, no, wait: the formula for a cyclohexene (C6H10) is C6H10, which has 10 H. But when substituents are added, each substituent replaces a hydrogen.

So substituents:

- CHO: has one H (the aldehyde H).

- COOH: the COOH group is -C(O)OH. The structure is O=C(OH)-. Wait, no, the COOH is -COOH, which is O=C(O-)OH2. But in the molecule, it's -COOH, which has two O's. The H count for the COOH group: in the COOH substituent, the -COOH group has two H's: one in the -OH and the others? Wait, no, the structure is -C(O)OH. So the substituent is attached to the ring as -C(O)OH, which has one H in the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each substituent as replacing a hydrogen on the ring.

So the cyclohexene ring has 6 H (from C6H10), but with substituents, each substituent will take away one H.

So:

Original ring: 6 H.

Substituents: formyl (CHO), COOH, vinyl (CH2=CH-).

Wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is a substituent attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, so it's actually -CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the two CH2s. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond, so it's -CH2-CH2- but with the double bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2-, but the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, making it CH2=CH-. So the substituent is attached as -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond, making it CH2=CH-.

So, for the substituents:

- Formyl (CHO): replaces one H on the ring. CHO has one H (the aldehyde H).

- COOH: replaces another H on the ring. COOH has two H: one in the -OH group and the other in the ring (but wait, the ring's C is attached to the COOH, so in the COOH group, the H is just the one in the -OH.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't the best. Let's try to count H another way.

The formula is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Assuming the formula is C10H10O3.

Wait, how?

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

The substituents add 4 more carbons: formyl (1 C), vinyl (2 C), COOH (1 C) â†’ total 6 +4 = 10?

Wait, but wait, cyclohexene is C6H10.

Each substituent adds (for each group):

- Formyl (CHO): adds one C, one O. The formula would be CHO â†’ C: +1, O: +1. Hydrogens: the CHO group has one H (the aldehyde H).

- COOH: adds one C, two O. Hydrogens: the COOH group has two H (the -OH and maybe another from the structure).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to figure out the molecular formula.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the parent chain is cyclohex-3-ene (C6H10).

Adding substituents:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) â†’ adds C and O. So the formula becomes C7H10O.

Wait, but wait, each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So adding a CHO group would mean adding one C and one O, but losing a H.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the formula is better computed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to the reaction part first, as that may be necessary to find the product's structure.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I recall that red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no. Wait, maybe it's for elimination reactions. Alternatively, it's used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: when alkenes are treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to perform an addition reaction. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when alkenes are treated with HI, it's a halogenation via hydrohalogenation. But with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, red phosphorus can be used as a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought. Red phosphorus with HI could be used in the hydrolysis of alkynes to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction here is a hydration of the triple bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the starting material and the possible reactions.

The starting material has a formyl group and a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. It also has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that this is a reaction that converts triple bonds to carboxylic acids, but perhaps I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example, nitriles (R-Câ‰¡N) can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids (R-COOH) using a strong acid like HI and a catalyst like red phosphorus. But in this starting material, I don't think there's a nitrile group. The substituents are formyl, vinyl, and a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the formyl group. The formyl group is CHO. Red phosphorus and HI: I remember that HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes, but I'm not sure about red phosphorus and HI. Wait, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, yes, I think red phosphorus and HI can reduce aldehydes (formyl groups) to alkanes. For example, the reaction of an aldehyde with excess HI and red phosphorus would convert RCHO â†’ RCH2I. Wait, but maybe in this case, with excess HI, it's further reacted.

Wait, let's think. So, the reaction is:

RCHO + excess HI â†’ RCH2I ?

But wait, another possibility: the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2OH (alcohol) under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to CH2I (iodomethane) under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting molecule and the possible reactions. Let's list the functional groups:

- Cyclohexene ring (with a double bond).

- Formyl group (CHO) at position 2.

- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5.

- Carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 3.

When this is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens?

Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, an aldehyde (RCHO) is converted into RCH2I. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I.

Wait, but then the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is also an alkene. How would that react with HI?

HI is a strong acid and can add to alkenes. But in the presence of excess HI, perhaps the alkene would undergo addition, not elimination.

Wait, but the vinyl group is a substituent on the ring. So, when treated with HI, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI via addition. The reaction with an alkene and HI would add HI across the double bond, so the vinyl group would become CH2-CH2I (but wait, it would actually be CH2-I and CH2- attached to something else).

Wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. Adding HI would protonate the double bond, leading to a carbocation, which would then be attacked by iodide. The result would be 1-iodoethane addition. So the vinyl group CH2=CH- would become CH2-I-CH2-Ring? No, perhaps more accurately, the addition would lead to CH2-CH2-I, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the vinyl group would add two equivalents of HI, leading to CH2I-CH2I? No, that's unlikely because each addition would happen once.

Wait, but in the presence of excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group would be completely saturated, but let's think step by step.

So, the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI.

Red phosphorus reacts with HI to produce H3PO3 and I2. So, the environment is rich in I- ions.

So, the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2I. Because red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of aldehydes to alkanes, but in this case, since it's in excess HI, perhaps it's a different outcome. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is converted into an alkoxy group or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the exact reaction, but I think the formyl group is reduced.

So, the formyl group (CHO) at position 2 would become CH2I.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI. Since HI is in excess, the reaction would add HI across the double bond. So the vinyl group would become CH2I-CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, no. When an alkene reacts with HI, it adds H and I across the double bond. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-CH2I, but the actual structure would be CH2-CH2I, but more accurately, CH2-I-CH2- attached to the ring? Or would it be CH2-CH2I attached as CH2-CH2I, but connected to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substitution is such that the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-CH2I. But in reality, when an alkene reacts with HI, it adds H and I across the double bond, so the structure would become CH2-I-CH2- ... Wait, no, the addition would be to each end. So the vinyl group CH2=CH- would add H and I, becoming CH2-CH2I. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-I-CH2- but connected to the ring. So the substituent at position 5 becomes CH2-CH2I.

Wait, but let me think again: when an alkene (like CH2=CH-) reacts with HI, it undergoes addition, so each carbon of the double bond gets an H and an I. So, the structure becomes CH2-CH2I, but that's not possible. Wait, no. The correct product would be CH2-I-CH2- but with each carbon having one H and one I. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2-I and CH2-I connected together? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it would be CH2-I-CH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. Adding HI would add H to one end and I to the other. So, the double bond CH2=CH- would become CH2-CH2I, but that's not correct. Wait, when you add HI to propene (CH2=CH2), it becomes CH2-I-CH2-CH3, but wait, no: actually, the addition is in a way that each end of the double bond gets an H and I. So, CH2=CH2 + HI â†’ CH2I-CH2I? No, wait, no. It's more accurate to say that the double bond opens up, and each carbon gets an H and an I. So, for CH2=CH- (vinyl group), adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2- (but that's not possible). Alternatively, perhaps the addition is CH2-CH2I, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should find the product structure first.

So, the reaction of the starting material with excess HI and red phosphorus.

1. The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2I.

2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds HI across the double bond, becoming CH2-CH2I. Wait, but in reality, when you add HI to an alkene, you get a diiodide? No, because each carbon can only take one I. So, perhaps the product is CH2-I-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, adding HI would give CH2-I and CH2-H. No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2I with the I on one end. So the substituent becomes CH2-CH2I, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with HI and red phosphorus leads to the breaking of the double bond in the vinyl group and the substituent becomes CH2-CH2I.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the overall effect on the product's structure.

The product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring, but perhaps the double bond is still present unless the reaction affects it.

Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the cyclohexene double bond. Because the reaction conditions are for the formyl and vinyl groups. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce the formyl group and add to the vinyl group.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring: if the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond, it remains. But wait, the ring's double bond is part of the ring structure. The reaction is focused on the substituents, not the ring's double bond. So the ring's double bond may remain.

- The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2I.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds HI, becoming CH2-CH2I.

Wait, but then what about the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product?

Product structure:

- Cyclohexene ring: has a double bond (1), contributing 1 to index.

- The formyl group is now CH2I: no double bonds, so nothing.

- The vinyl group is now CH2-CH2I: no double bonds, so nothing.

Wait, but wait, the vinyl group was a double bond before the reaction, but after the reaction, it's a single bond. So the product's substituents no longer have any double bonds (other than the ring's).

So, the product's index would be:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2.

Wait, no, the index counts each ring and each double bond as one each. So the ring contributes 1, and the double bond in the ring contributes another, so total 2. The other groups (CH2I and CH2-CH2I) don't have any double bonds or rings.

So the product has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond (so index 2) and no other double bonds or rings from substituents.

Wait, but wait, the product may have other double bonds. For example, if the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond, then the product's index would be 2 (from the ring and its double bond) plus any other double bonds from substituents.

But in this case, the substituents (formyl and vinyl) have been modified. The formyl became CH2I (no double bond), and the vinyl became CH2-CH2I (no double bond). So, the product has only the ring's double bond and the ring itself.

So the index is 2.

Wait, but wait, the starting material had an index of 4, and the product has an index of 2. So the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, but none of the options is 2. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product's structure is different. Maybe the reaction doesn't just modify the substituents but also affects the ring.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI: perhaps the formyl group is converted into CH2I (so, no double bond), and the vinyl group's double bond is saturated (so no double bond). The cyclohexene ring's double bond remains.

So the product's structure would have:

- A cyclohexene ring (still has a double bond, so 1 ring, 1 double bond: index 2).

- A CH2I group at position 2.

- A CH2-CH2I group at position 5.

- A COOH group at position 3.

Wait, but wait, the COOH group is a carboxylic acid, which has a carbonyl group (double bond). So that's another double bond.

So the product has:

- Cyclohexene ring: ring (1) and double bond (1) â†’ 2.

- COOH group: carbonyl (1) â†’ 1.

- Other substituents: CH2I and CH2-CH2I (no double bonds).

So, the index would be 2 (from ring and its double bond) + 1 (from COOH's carbonyl) = 3.

So the index is 3. Looking at the options, option B is 3.

Wait, but wait, the starting material had a COOH group. The reaction is with HI and red phosphorus; would the COOH group undergo any reaction? Well, HI is a strong acid, but in the presence of a carboxylic acid, which is a stronger acid than HI, perhaps the HI would deprotonate the COOH, but I don't think it would cause any reaction beyond that. So the COOH group remains as is in the product.

Therefore, the product has index 3. So the correct answer is option B.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following features:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: This contributes 1 ring and 1 double bond (total = 2).
2. **Formyl group (-CHO)**: This contributes 1 double bond (total = 1).
3. **Vinyl group (-CH=CH-)**: This contributes 1 double bond (total = 1).
4. **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This contributes 1 double bond (total = 1).

Thus, the starting material has an index of hydrogen deficiency of **4**.

When the starting material is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI:

1. **Reduction of the formyl group (-CHO)**: The formyl group is reduced to -CH2I, eliminating its double bond.
2. **Addition to the vinyl group (-CH=CH-)**: The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated by addition of HI, converting it to -CH2-CH2I.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring remains unaffected, contributing 1 to the index.
4. **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: The carbonyl group remains intact, contributing 1 to the index.

In the product:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: 1 ring and 1 double bond (total = 2).
2. **Formyl group (-CHO)**: Converted to -CH2I, with no double bonds.
3. **Vinyl group (-CH=CH-)**: Converted to -CH2-CH2I, with no double bonds.
4. **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: 1 double bond (total = 1).

Thus, the product has an index of hydrogen deficiency of **3**.

The correct answer is **B) 3**.
