Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that qubits are represented in a two-dimensional space, but when we talk about geometrical positions, I think it's in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1| ). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because both |0> and |1> are equally probable, so the state is completely mixed, not pure.

In the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and its representation on the Bloch sphere is a point on the surface. But this ρ is a mixed state because it's a mixture of |0> and |1> with equal probabilities.

Wait, how do density matrices correspond to points in the Bloch sphere? I think the Bloch vector (or sometimes called the purity vector) is calculated from the density matrix. For a general 2x2 density matrix, the Bloch vector (let's call it r) is given by:

r = [x, y, z]

And each component is calculated as follows:

x = Tr(ρ (A_x)), where A_x is the Pauli X matrix times some factor?
Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that for a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components can be found using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So:

x = <σ_x> = Tr(ρ σ_x)
y = <σ_y> = Tr(ρ σ_y)
z = <σ_z> = Tr(ρ σ_z)

But since ρ is diagonal here, let me think about that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, let's compute each component.

First, the density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let's write this out.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So ρ is (1/2)([[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] ) = [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

Now compute each trace with the Pauli matrices.

For σ_x: [[0,1],[1,0]]
ρ σ_x = (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] * [[0,1],[1,0]] → Let me compute the product.

Wait, matrix multiplication: first row of ρ is [1/2, 0], σ_x first column is [0,1]. So (1/2)(0*1 + 0*1) = 0 for (1,1) element? Wait no, maybe I should compute each element.

Wait, no. Alternatively, since ρ is diagonal and σ_x is off-diagonal, their product might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the trace of ρ multiplied by each Pauli matrix.

The trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements. So Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*0? Let's compute.

Wait, ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], and σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρ σ_x is:

[ [ (1/2)(0) + 0*(1), (1/2)(1) + 0*(0) ],
  [ 0*(0) + (1/2)(1), 0*(1) + (1/2)(0) ] ]

Wait, no, matrix multiplication: (ρ σ_x)_{i,j} = sum_k ρ_ik σ_x_kj.

So:

Element (1,1): ρ_11 σ_x_11 + ρ_12 σ_x_12
But ρ_12 is 0. So ρ_11 is 1/2, σ_x_11 is 0. So element (1,1)=0.

Element (1,2): ρ_11 σ_x_12 + ρ_12 σ_x_22. σ_x_12 is 1, σ_x_22 is 0. So (1/2)*1 + 0 * 0 = 1/2.

Similarly, Element (2,1): ρ_21 σ_x_11 + ρ_22 σ_x_21. ρ_21 is 0, σ_x_21 is 1. So 0 + (1/2)*1 = 1/2.

Element (2,2): ρ_21 σ_x_12 + ρ_22 σ_x_22. Both are zero except ρ_22 is 1/2, σ_x_22 is 0. So 0.

So ρ σ_x is:
[[0, 1/2],
 [1/2, 0]]

The trace is 0 + 0 = 0. So x = Tr(ρ σ_x) = 0.

Similarly, for Tr(ρ σ_y):

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So ρ σ_y will be [[0, (-i)(1/2)], [ (i)(1/2), 0 ]]

Trace is 0 + 0 = 0. So y = 0.

Now for σ_z: [[1,0],[0,-1]]

ρ σ_z = (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = (1/2) * [[1*1 + 0*0, 1*0 +0*(-1) ], [0*1 +1*0, 0*0 +1*(-1) ] ]

Wait, actually, ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so each element:

(1/2)*1 = 1/2 at (1,1), (1/2)*(-1) at (2,2). So ρ σ_z is [[1/2, 0], [0, -1/2]]

The trace is (1/2) + (-1/2) = 0. Wait, no, wait: Tr is the sum of diagonals, so 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0. So z = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because the Bloch vector would then be (0,0,0), which is the completely mixed state. Oh wait, but that's exactly what this state is. Because ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. The maximally mixed state has no coherence and equal probabilities, so it's in the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin.

So the coordinates would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This is a maximally mixed state, as it represents equal probabilities for the qubit to be in states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) with no coherence. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we map it to the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\), respectively:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the density matrix
The density matrix is explicitly:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x)\)
The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). The product \(\rho \sigma_x\) is:
\[
\rho \sigma_x = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The trace of this matrix is \(0 + 0 = 0\), so \(x = 0\).

### Step 3: Compute \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y)\)
The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). The product \(\rho \sigma_y\) is:
\[
\rho \sigma_y = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The trace of this matrix is \(0 + 0 = 0\), so \(y = 0\).

### Step 4: Compute \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z)\)
The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). The product \(\rho \sigma_z\) is:
\[
\rho \sigma_z = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The trace of this matrix is \(\frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0\), so \(z = 0\).

### Step 5: Determine the Bloch vector
The Bloch vector is \(r = (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

### Final Answer:
The geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
