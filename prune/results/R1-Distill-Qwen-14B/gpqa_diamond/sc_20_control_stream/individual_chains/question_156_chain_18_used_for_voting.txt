Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions using (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard (achiral) and chiral.

Hmm, right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is used in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it should form an epoxide. Wait, but wait—how does the geometry of the starting alkene affect the epoxide formation?

Epoxidation with mCPBA typically occurs through an electrocyclic ring-opening and then a ring-closing. Oh, right, it's an peracid adding across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific, so the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) would influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no. Let me think. For alkenes reacting with mCPBA, the epoxidation forms an epoxide where the oxygen adds across the double bond. The process is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the two substituents opposite each other, what happens? When mCPBA adds, the peracid attacks the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds with a specific stereochemistry. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me recall: mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, creating an epoxide. The addition is such that the new oxygen atoms are added with the same stereochemistry as the double bond.

Wait, no, perhaps the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For (E) alkenes, the substituents are on opposite sides, so when the epoxide forms, the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen substituents on opposite sides, making it a trans-dihydroxy epoxide? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Diastereomer aspects. When mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, this would result in different epoxide structures.

Wait, if the starting alkene is (E)-oct-4-ene, then the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the epoxide would form with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, so the epoxide would have a trans configuration. Similarly, if the starting alkene is (Z), the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same side, making it cis.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → trans epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, what happens? I remember that epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making the ring more electrophilic. Then a nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon, leading to a diol.

Wait, but wait, in acid conditions, after epoxide formation, the ring-opening leads to the diol. So each epoxide would form a diol. The configuration of the diol depends on the epoxide's stereochemistry.

Let me think about the (E) epoxide. It's trans. So when the acid is added, the ring opens to form a diol. The trans epoxide would result in a trans diol, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the trans epoxide leads to an anti addition of water, hence a trans diol. Or perhaps the diol's stereochemistry is determined differently.

Wait, no, let me be more precise. When an epoxide opens under acidic conditions, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving oxygen. So the attack is from the side opposite to the protonated oxygen. This leads to a trans diol.

Wait, so if the epoxide is trans, the attack would lead to the diol. Let me imagine the structure. Let's say the epoxide is from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is CH₂CH₂-CH₂CH₂ in the middle, but the substituents (CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. Wait, actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, octene is C8H16. Structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Or wait, perhaps I should draw it.

But maybe another approach: when the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the diol formed will have adjacent hydroxyl groups in a trans configuration if the epoxide was trans, or cis if the epoxide was cis. Wait, no, perhaps the diol's configuration depends on the attack direction.

Wait, for a trans epoxide, each oxygen has the same substituents on opposite sides. So when water attacks the more substituted carbon (which is the same for both in octene?), but perhaps not. Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, right? Because it's (E) and (Z) but the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, the structure is actually CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps I should correct myself.

Wait, let me get the structure right. Oct-4-ene is an eight-carbon chain with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that can't be right because the double bond is between C4 and C5. So more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. No, that's not correct. Let me write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, perhaps I should think of it as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, so the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps it's not necessary for the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the diastereomers and whether the products are the same or different.

So, if Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene and forms a trans epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, it opens to form a diol. Similarly, Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene, which forms a cis epoxide, which then opens to form another diol.

Wait, but when the epoxide is opened under acid, the diol formed would have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. The configuration of the diol would depend on whether the epoxide was cis or trans.

Wait, for a trans epoxide, when the ring opens, the hydroxyl groups would be on opposite sides, leading to a diol with a trans configuration. For a cis epoxide, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side, leading to a cis diol.

Wait, but wait, actually, the epoxide ring opening under acid conditions leads to the formation of a diol with adjacent OH groups. Let's imagine the epoxide as a three-membered ring. When the acid protonates the epoxide, making it positively polarized, water attacks the more substituted carbon. The attack occurs from the opposite side of the leaving oxygen. So for a trans epoxide, the attack would lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the oct-4-ene epoxidation. Let me imagine that the alkene is symmetric. Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are geometric isomers, but since the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (each end has two CH2 groups on one side and two CH2 groups on the other?), perhaps the epoxide formed from (E) is a trans epoxide, and from (Z) is a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but perhaps each carbon of the double bond has two CH2 groups on either side. So maybe the (E) and (Z) isomers are actually the same because the substituents are identical on each end. Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, (E) and (Z) isomerism requires different substituents on each carbon of the double bond. So for oct-4-ene, each carbon of the double bond has a CH2CH2 group on one side and a CH2CH2CH2CH3 on the other. Wait, no, perhaps each end of the double bond is CH2CH2 on one side and CH2CH2CH2CH3 on the other. So, wait, no, perhaps each carbon of the double bond is attached to two different substituents, making (E) and (Z) possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me take a step back.

The key point is that when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene forms another epoxide, which may be different. Then, each epoxide is opened under acidic conditions to form diols.

Wait, but if the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), then their epoxides would be different, leading to different diols upon ring opening.

Wait, but when the diol forms, does it form as a pair of enantiomers or as a single compound? If the diol is chiral, then each epoxide would form a single diastereomer, but perhaps with different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the epoxides would lead to a single diol, but as enantiomers. Or maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, so Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → acid → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → acid → diol B.

Now, are diol A and diol B the same, or are they different compounds?

Wait, if the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), then the epoxides would be different, leading to different diols. But perhaps the diols are diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, if diol A is from a trans epoxide, and diol B from a cis epoxide, then diol A and diol B could be enantiomers or diastereomers, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe diol A and diol B are the same compound. No, wait, that can't be right. Because the starting alkenes are different, the epoxides are different, so the diols would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structures.

Let me imagine that oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that's 6 carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as (CH2)3-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that can't be right. Maybe it's better to think of it as 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane... Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps the key point is that the diols from the (E) and (Z) starting materials are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps when mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms an epoxide that, when opened, gives a diol with a specific configuration, and (Z) does the same but gives a different diol.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, perhaps the ring-opening leads to a single diol. But if the starting epoxide is asymmetric, then the diol would have two chiral centers, leading to possible enantiomers.

Wait, so suppose the diol has two adjacent chiral centers. Then, when the epoxide is opened, each diol would have a specific configuration.

Wait, let's say the diol from (E) is (R,R) and (S,S), and the diol from (Z) is (R,S) and (S,R), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (E)-epoxide is a single enantiomer, and the diol from (Z) is another single enantiomer, but maybe they are the same.

Wait, maybe each diol is a pair of enantiomers. No, wait, under acidic conditions, the epoxide would open into a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach.

Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA gives a trans epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, this epoxide would ring-open to form a diol. Similarly, the (Z) would form a cis epoxide, which would then form a diol upon ring-opening.

Now, the diol from the trans epoxide would have adjacent hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans-diol. The diol from the cis epoxide would have adjacent OH groups on the same side, leading to a cis-diol.

Wait, but in an eight-carbon chain, the diol would be in the middle. So, for example, the structure would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but the exact configuration depends on the epoxide. Let me think: for the (E) epoxide, the diol formed would be trans, and for the (Z) epoxide, the diol would be cis.

So after both reactions, the chemist has two diols: one trans and one cis.

Wait, but wait, when you open a trans epoxide, do you get a trans diol? Or does it depend on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the (E) epoxide is a single enantiomer, and the diol from the (Z) is another single enantiomer, but perhaps they are the same molecule. Or perhaps they're different.

Wait, perhaps the diols are enantiomers. Because if the epoxide is trans, the diol might have two chiral centers with R and R configuration, while the cis epoxide might lead to S and S. Alternatively, perhaps each diol has two chiral centers, making them diastereomers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the diastereomers and enantiomers.

When the epoxide is symmetric, like in a cyclic structure, the diol formed may not be chiral. But in this case, the starting material is oct-4-ene, which is a straight chain. So the epoxide would have two substituents on each oxygen. Wait, perhaps the diol formed has two adjacent chiral centers.

So for example, suppose the diol is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The two CH(OH) groups are on adjacent carbons. Each would have two different substituents, making them chiral centers.

So, for the (E) epoxide, the diol would have the two OH groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol with, say, R and S configurations. Wait, no, that would be anti, but perhaps it's more about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the (E) epoxide is a racemic mixture, but no, because the reaction is 100% complete and goes to a single product. Wait, but epoxide formation with mCPBA is stereospecific, leading to a single epoxide. Then, the acid treatment leads to a single diol. So each reaction produces a single diol.

Wait, so Reaction 1 gives diol A, and Reaction 2 gives diol B. Are A and B the same? Or are they enantiomers or diastereomers?

In the case of (E) and (Z) alkenes leading to different epoxides, which in turn produce different diols, then the diols would be different. Let me think: the diol from (E) would have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol, while the diol from (Z) would have hydroxyl groups on the same side, leading to a cis diol.

Wait, no, because the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration and the ring-opening. So in the case of a trans epoxide, when the ring opens, the hydroxyl groups would be on opposite sides, making a trans diol. Similarly, a cis epoxide would form a cis diol.

So, each reaction produces a single diol, which is either cis or trans.

Wait, but wait, then when the products are combined, the mixture would have two different diols: one cis and one trans. But are these diols chiral?

If each diol has two chiral centers, then each would be a pair of enantiomers. But if the diol is meso, then it would be achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, so for example, a diol with two adjacent chiral centers might be a meso compound. Let me imagine the structure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. If the two OH groups are on opposite sides, it might be a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, suppose the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound (because the two OHs are on opposite sides, making it symmetrical). Similarly, the diol from (Z) would also be a meso compound but perhaps a different configuration.

Wait, no, if the diol from (E) is a meso compound, then it's achiral, and the diol from (Z) would also be a meso compound, perhaps. But that can't be right because in such a case, both would be the same compound, which is not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a meso compound, but they are different meso compounds. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereomer aspect. So, when combining the products, the mixture will have two diastereomers. Because each reaction produces a diol that's a diastereomer of the other.

Wait, but if each diol is a meso compound, then the two diols would be the same, but that's not possible because the starting materials were different.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. For example, diol A from (E) is (R,R) and (S,S), and diol B from (Z) is (R,S) and (S,R), but then combining them would give a mixture.

Wait, but the reactions go to 100% completion, so each reaction produces a single enantiomer. Then, combining them would give two enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is stereospecific. So (E) would lead to one diol, and (Z) to another diol, each of which may consist of a pair of enantiomers. So, for example, Reaction 1 produces (R,R) and (S,S) as a racemic mixture. But since the reaction goes to 100% completion, perhaps it's a single enantiomer, which would require some other condition. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the epoxide is a single diastereomer, and upon ring-opening, the diol is a single enantiomer. Similarly, the (Z) epoxide leads to a diol that is another enantiomer.

Wait, but in either case, the diol would have two chiral centers, and if the diol is a meso compound, then it would be achiral. So each diol would be a meso compound, but for the two epoxides, perhaps they are different meso compounds.

Wait, but let's consider the actual product structures. Suppose oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, then the epoxide would have two new oxygen atoms bridging the C4 and C5.

Upon acid treatment, the epoxide would open to form a diol. For the (E) epoxide, the diol would have the two OH groups on opposite positions, and for the (Z), on the same side.

Wait, but in any case, the diol from (E) and (Z) would have different configurations, but perhaps each diol is a meso compound, making them achiral.

No, because for a molecule to be meso, it needs to have a plane of symmetry. So, if the diol from (E) has two OH groups on opposite sides, leading to a symmetrical structure, it would be a meso compound (achiral). Similarly, the diol from (Z) would have OHs on the same side, which might not be symmetrical, making it a chiral molecule.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take the diol from (E) epoxide: suppose the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. If the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Alternatively, if the OHs are on the same side, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E) is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z) is another meso compound, but that's not possible because (E) and (Z) would lead to different structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (E) is a meso compound, while the diol from (Z) is chiral, leading to two different molecules.

Wait, but I'm not making progress with this approach. Let me try to think about what the HPLC would show.

The question asks about the number of peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC and chiral HPLC.

In standard HPLC, enantiomers would co-elute because the column is achiral. So any enantiomeric pairs would appear as a single peak.

In chiral HPLC, enantiomers would separate into two peaks.

Now, considering that the chemist combines the products of both reactions. Let's say each reaction gives a diol.

If each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then when combined, the mixture would have two enantiomeric pairs. But wait, no, each reaction produces a single diastereomer, perhaps a single enantiomer.

Wait, let's think: each reaction produces a specific diol. Let's say Reaction 1 produces diol A as a single enantiomer, and Reaction 2 produces diol B as a single enantiomer. Are A and B enantiomers or diastereomers?

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a mixture of enantiomers, but I think the reactions are stereospecific and go to 100% completion, so each produces a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 gives diol A as a single enantiomer, and Reaction 2 gives diol B as another single enantiomer, which is a different molecule. Then, combining these would give two different enantiomers. But if diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then in chiral HPLC, they would each produce two peaks, leading to four peaks. Alternatively, perhaps diol A and diol B are the same, so combining would give a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. So Reaction 1 produces diol A (R) and diol A (S), and Reaction 2 produces diol B (R) and diol B (S). But that doesn't seem right because the reaction conditions are 100% complete, so each would produce a single diol.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the answer in terms of the HPLC results.

Assuming that each reaction produces a diol, and the diols are different, then when combined, the mixture would have two different diols. Now, whether each diol is chiral or not would determine how many peaks appear in the HPLC.

If a diol is achiral (meso), then in standard HPLC (achiral) it would give one peak, and in chiral HPLC, also one peak because the column can't separate achiral molecules.

If a diol is chiral, then in standard HPLC it gives one peak (since it's a single compound), and in chiral HPLC, two peaks (enantiomers).

Wait, no. Wait, standard HPLC (achiral) would not separate enantiomers. So if a diol is chiral, standard HPLC would show it as a single peak. But in chiral HPLC, it would show two peaks (enantiomers).

So, let's say Reaction 1 gives a diol that's a meso compound (achiral). Then, in standard HPLC, it's one peak. In chiral HPLC, it's also one peak.

Reaction 2 gives a diol that's chiral. So in standard HPLC, it's one peak. In chiral HPLC, it's two peaks.

When the products are combined, the mixture has both diols.

So, the number of peaks in each HPLC would be:

Standard HPLC: two peaks (meso and chiral diol, each as single compounds).

Chiral HPLC: one peak for the meso diol (since it's achiral and doesn't separate) and two peaks for the chiral diol (enantiomers), so a total of three peaks.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me review the options.

Option B: 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

Option D: 3 in standard and 4 in chiral.

Wait, but in the scenario I'm considering, in standard HPLC, you have two peaks (each diol is a single compound, so you'd see two peaks). In chiral HPLC, the meso diol gives one peak, and the chiral diol gives two, so total three peaks. So that would be 2 and 3, which is option B.

But wait, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. Let's think again.

If Reaction 1 produces a diol that's a racemic mixture (two enantiomers), and Reaction 2 also produces a racemic mixture, then when combined, you have four enantiomers. But that's impossible because each reaction only goes to a single product. So each reaction produces a single enantiomer, not a racemic mix.

Wait, mCPBA adds with a specific stereochemistry, leading to a single epoxide. Then, the acid ring-opening leads to a single diol. So each reaction produces a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but that's not possible because the reaction is stereospecific and produces a single configuration.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible options and what each implies.

Option C is both standard and chiral giving two peaks. That would mean that the mixture contains two diastereomers, each of which is a single compound (either achiral or chiral but not in a way that produces additional peaks). But if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then standard HPLC would show two, but chiral would show four. But that's not one of the options.

Option B: standard 2, chiral 3. So in standard HPLC, two peaks. In chiral, three.

How? Suppose the mixture has two diols: one is a meso compound (achiral), and the other is a chiral diol.

In standard HPLC: each would be one peak, so two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: the meso is one peak, the chiral diol would separate into two, so total three peaks.

So that matches option B (2 and 3 peaks).

Another possibility: the two diols are each chiral, but are enantiomers of each other. So when combined, they form a racemic mixture. Then, in standard HPLC, each is a single compound, so two peaks. In chiral HPLC, each would split into two, leading to four peaks (each enantiomer of each diol). But that's option D (3 and 4 peaks?), no, option D is 3 and 4 in standard and chiral respectively. Wait, option D says 3 in standard and 4 in chiral. Wait, no, option D says standard has 3 and chiral has 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but each reaction produces only one enantiomer. So Reaction 1: produces diol A (R), and Reaction 2: produces diol B (S). If diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then combining them gives a racemic mixture. Then in standard HPLC, each would be a single peak (since they can't separate enantiomers), so two peaks. In chiral HPLC, each would split into two, leading to four peaks. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the options don't have 2 and 4. So perhaps that scenario isn't correct.

Another scenario: both diols are chiral and are enantiomers. Then, in standard HPLC, each is a single peak → two peaks. In chiral HPLC, each would split into two → four peaks (option not present).

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a meso compound, but they are different meso compounds. So each is achiral, leading to two peaks in standard HPLC, and each would be a single peak in chiral HPLC, so two peaks. So that would be option C (both 2 peaks).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereomers.

If the diols from (E) and (Z) are diastereomers, then each would be a single compound. So in standard HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, since each is a single enantiomer, they would each be a single peak, but if they have chiral centers, perhaps they're not. Wait, no, in chiral HPLC, diastereomers would elute at different times, leading to two peaks. So in standard HPLC: 2 peaks. In chiral HPLC: 2 peaks (each diastereomer is a single compound, but perhaps each has its own retention time).

Wait, that would lead to option C: both 2 peaks.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but each reaction produces a single enantiomer, leading to a total of two enantiomers. Then standard HPLC would show two peaks, and chiral HPLC would show four peaks (each enantiomer of each diol). But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps only one diol is chiral, and the other is achiral. Then, standard HPLC would show two peaks, and chiral HPLC would show three (the achiral as one, and the chiral as two). So that's option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the actual product.

Wait, when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the epoxide is trans. When this epoxide is opened under acid, the diol has the two OH groups on opposite sides, which in a symmetrical molecule would make it a meso compound. So, for example, if the diol is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, and the two OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, it's achiral.

On the other hand, the (Z) epoxide would form a diol with the OHs on the same side, leading to a chiral molecule (since there's no plane of symmetry). So, the diol from (Z) would have two chiral centers, and no plane of symmetry, making it a chiral compound.

So, the products are:

- From (E): meso diol (achiral).

- From (Z): chiral diol (two enantiomers, R and S).

Wait, but each reaction produces a single enantiomer, right? Because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to completion. So Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol (so one peak in any HPLC), and Reaction 2 produces a single enantiomer of the chiral diol, say R.

When combined, the mixture has:

- Meso diol (one peak in standard, one in chiral).

- R-enantiomer of chiral diol (one peak in standard, two in chiral because it would separate into R and S? No, wait, each reaction produces a single enantiomer. So Reaction 2 produces only R-enantiomer, so when combined, you have R-enantiomer. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 2 produces a single enantiomer of the chiral diol. So when you combine the two reactions' products, you have:

- Meso diol (1 peak in standard, 1 in chiral).

- One enantiomer of the chiral diol (1 peak in standard, 1 peak in chiral).

Wait, but that would mean standard HPLC has two peaks, and chiral HPLC has two peaks, which is option C.

But that doesn't fit with any observations. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture, but that's not the case because the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, perhaps I should think that Reaction 2 produces a single enantiomer of the chiral diol. So when combined with Reaction 1's meso diol, the mixture has two different diols.

In standard HPLC, each diol is a single compound → two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the meso diol → one peak, and the chiral diol (single enantiomer) → one peak. So total two peaks in chiral HPLC. But that would mean option C, but the options don't have that leading to 2 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If the diol from (E) is meso (achiral), then standard HPLC would show one peak for it. The diol from (Z) is chiral, and each reaction produces a single enantiomer. So when combined, you have the meso diol and one enantiomer of the chiral diol. So in standard HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, the meso diol is one peak, and the chiral diol (single enantiomer) is another peak, so two peaks total. So that would be option C (2 and 2), but option C says both have two peaks. So that would fit.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (Z) is a pair of enantiomers, but that's not the case because the reaction produces a single diastereomer.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

The correct answer is likely B: 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

Explanation: the products are a meso diol (1 peak in standard, 1 in chiral) and a chiral diol (1 peak in standard, 2 in chiral), totaling 2 in standard and 3 in chiral.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both reactions proceed to 100% completion. The products of these reactions are combined and analyzed using standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a **trans epoxide** due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the trans epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **diol**. The resulting diol has hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, making it a **meso compound** (achiral).  

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a **cis epoxide** due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the cis epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **diol**. The resulting diol has hydroxyl groups on the same side, making it a **chiral compound** with two enantiomers.  

3. **Combining the Products**  
   - The mixture contains:  
     - A meso diol (achiral) from Reaction 1.  
     - A chiral diol (with two enantiomers) from Reaction 2.  

4. **HPLC Analysis**  
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The meso diol appears as a single peak.  
     - The chiral diol also appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot distinguish enantiomers.  
     - Total: **2 peaks**.  

   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The meso diol appears as a single peak because it is achiral.  
     - The chiral diol separates into two peaks corresponding to its two enantiomers.  
     - Total: **3 peaks**.  

### Conclusion:
The standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks. This matches **Option B**.
