Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It asks about two parts: part A involves determining which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

The compounds given for part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. For part B, the options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, I need to understand what tautomerism and optical isomerism are.

Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton and a atom (usually hydrogen) moves between different positions, resulting in the same molecular formula but a different structure. For example, keto-enol tautomerism is common in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups. So, if a compound can undergo tautomerism, it means it can shift a hydrogen and a double bond between two positions, creating two different tautomers.

Optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is possible when there's an asymmetric carbon— a carbon attached to four different groups. Alternatively, compounds with other forms of asymmetry, like allenes or certain ring structures, can also exhibit optical isomerism.

Okay, now let's tackle part A first.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic di-ketone. Quinones generally can tautomerize because they have two ketone groups adjacent to each other (or in a conjugated system), allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait— benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So its structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen double bonds in adjacent positions? No, wait, benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups, which are across from each other (like para positions). For example, 1,4-benzoquinone. So in that case, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other. Could that lead to tautomerism?

In benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring, but I'm not sure if they're adjacent. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5, which are every other carbon. So, like O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C? No, wait, no— wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring, each at positions 1,3,5. So that's a six-membered ring with three alternating ketones. So, that makes it a conjugated triketone, which is more likely to undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, being a di-ketone, perhaps can't tautomerize because the two ketones are not adjacent. Let me think. Tautomerism usually requires adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, in furan, which has a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's consider if benzoquinone can tautomerize. Since the two carbonyl groups are in opposite positions on the benzene ring, they are not adjacent. So, can hydrogen shift occur? If the rings are large, maybe the groups are too far apart for tautomerism to happen. So perhaps benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are too far apart for the necessary hydrogen shift.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Wait, but they are 1,3,5 positions on a six-membered ring. So, each is separated by one carbon. For example, positions 1: O=C-O, position 3: another O=C-O, etc. Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, which is a six-membered ring with three ketones every other carbon. So, this arrangement could potentially allow for keto-enol tautomerism because adjacent carbonyl groups can facilitate the tautomer shift.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system that can delocalize the electrons, but without adjacent carbonyl groups, maybe tautomerism is not possible. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Tautomerism requires that a hydrogen atom can shift between two adjacent atoms, one of which must be involved in a double bond (like a carbonyl group). So, for example, in a diketone where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent (like 1,2-diketone), the molecule can tautomerize by moving a hydrogen from the carbon next to one carbonyl to the other, forming an enol. But for that, the two carbonyls need to be next to each other.

In benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are across the ring (para positions), so they are not adjacent. Thus, they can't tautomerize because the distance is too great for the hydrogen to shift. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are every other carbon. So, they are not adjacent either. Wait, but wait—1,3,5 in a six-membered ring means each is separated by one carbon. So, they are two carbons apart, not adjacent. That would mean they are not adjacent, so tautomerism is not possible. Hmm, but wait, in a cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, can the structure allow for any kind of conjugation that would permit tautomerism? I'm a bit uncertain here.

Wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, but they're not adjacent, so they can't tautomerize. But then, which of the two compounds can't tautomerize?

Alternatively, perhaps both can or both can't. Wait, but the question states that among the two, one doesn't show tautomerism. So, we have to choose which one.

Wait, another thought: maybe benzoquinone can undergo some kind of tautomerism. Let me think about the structure. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. If they are adjacent, like in 1,2-benzoquinone, then tautomerism is possible. But benzoquinone is more commonly 1,4-benzoquinone, where the carbonyls are across the ring. So, that structure can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should recall some examples. For instance, furan derivatives can tautomerize, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. Let me think about the structure. If it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at 1,3,5 positions, then each is separated by a CH2 group. So, perhaps the carbonyl groups are in positions that allow for a conjugated system but not necessarily adjacent. So, maybe tautomerism is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't tautomerize because the necessary adjacent carbonyl groups are not present.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to part B and then come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

So, I need to check if each has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is: 

The formula is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, propanoate is the propionate ion: CH2CH2COO^-. So, the ester would be methyl propionate, but with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure would be:

O
| 
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's:

The propanoate group is CH2CH2COO^-.

But with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the carbons are: COOCH3 is the ester group, then next is CH2, then CH(OH), then another CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO^-. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoate—so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, two CH2 groups attached, and the carbonyl group.

Wait, so the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to: a hydroxyl group (OH), two CH2 groups (one leading to the ester, the other to CH3?), or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

- The first carbon is connected to the ester group (COOCH3).

- The second carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) and is connected to the third carbon (which is CH2? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon chain:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So, the structure would be: the first carbon is CH3, the second is C(OH)H, and the third is COOCH3. So, the second carbon has a hydroxyl, two CH groups (wait, no, maybe one CH and one CH3? No, perhaps not.)

Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a chiral center. The second carbon (carbon 2) has the following attached groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's connected to four different groups.

Wait, if carbon 2 is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- another CH2 group? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-. In the ester, it's CH2CH2COOCH3.

But with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)

2: CH2

3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make it a three-carbon chain with the middle carbon (carbon 2) attached to a hydroxyl group and two CH2 groups. No, wait, the middle carbon would be connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH),

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- and two H's?

Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no, that would make it a four-carbon chain. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's easier to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center.

So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four groups attached: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The ester group is at carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2 is CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, that would make the structure: CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, carbon 2 is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- CH3,

- and another CH2 group (from carbon 1). Wait, no, that can't be. Because carbon 1 is CH2(COOCH3), so carbon 2 would be connected to carbon 1 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH3), OH, and maybe another CH2? I'm not so sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is better represented as CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, that would be four carbons, but propanoate is three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that would make the central carbon (CH2) connected to:

- COOCH3 group,

- the OH group,

- two CH3 groups.

Wait, if that's the case, then the central carbon (CH2) has two CH3 groups attached. So, in that case, the central carbon would have two identical groups (CH3), making it not a chiral center. Because for a chiral center, all four attached groups must be different.

So, if the central carbon has two CH3 groups, then it can't be a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait—maybe the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain: CH3, then CHOH, then COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from carbon 1).

Wait, but in that case, the groups attached to carbon 2 would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and H.

Wait, so carbon 2 would have four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that would make it a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So, the second carbon would have:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH3,

- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, if the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups,

- and the COOCH3.

So, the groups attached would be: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3, and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the possible structures for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-.

So, when it's 2-hydroxy, the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So, the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (position 2) is CH2(OH), which is connected to two CH2 groups and an OH.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-. So, the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3?

Wait, no, because propanoate is three carbons. So, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the middle carbon is CH2(OH), connected to:

- Left: CH2 group,

- Right: COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Wait, in that case, the middle carbon has:

- CH2 group (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- two H's,

- and an OH.

So, the four groups attached to the middle carbon would be:

- CH2 (from left),

- COOCH3 (from right),

- H,

- and OH.

Wait, so that's four different groups. Hence, the middle carbon would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait— the middle carbon is CH2(OH), so it's actually CH2, which has two H's. So, the groups attached are:

- CH2 (from left: which is connected to another CH2 and then the COOCH3),

Wait, perhaps that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (C) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- and H.

So, all four groups are different: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Hence, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and hence shows optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that's not correct. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer of maleic acid, so it's HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond.

In dimethyl fumarate, both carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methyl groups, so it's CH2(COOCH3)2 in a cis configuration around the double bond.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, fumarate is CH2=CH(COOH)2. So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Ah, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but wait: fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the structure is trans or cis? Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer. So, when you draw the structure, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the molecule would have a double bond with two ester groups on the same side. Does this create any form of stereoisomerism?

In the case of a double bond, if it's a geometric isomer, that's different from optical isomerism. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

Wait, but in this structure, can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see.

If the double bond has two identical groups on each side, then the molecule would be symmetrical. But in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, perhaps another way:

The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
But that's not correct because fumarate is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond between the two central carbons.

So, correct structure:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because that would mean each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's a single bond. No. Fumarate has a double bond.

So, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2=CH.

Wait, no, the correct structure is actually:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. No, because dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester, so each carboxylic acid group is esterified with a methyl group. So, each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then it might not have a chiral center but could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral. Because an object is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry. So, in dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, each carbon in the double bond has the same substituents (COOCH3 and CH2 groups?), making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, but that would make the molecule CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond in the middle, making it CH2=CH.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2=CH with each CH2 connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that would make the molecule symmetric across the double bond, meaning it has a plane of symmetry. So, it would be achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, then looking back: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (if the structure is correct), and dimethyl fumarate doesn't. So, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure has a chiral center. But wait, in the structure I'm considering, the middle carbon is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. So, that molecule would have optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: is dimethyl fumarate planar? Since it's a trans or cis di-substituted compound. Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, it's not chiral.

So, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, going back to part A.

Which of the two compounds (benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does, then A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about both compounds' ability to tautomerize.

Benzoquinone: if it's 1,4-benzoquinone (para positions), then the two carbonyl groups are across the ring. They are not adjacent, so tautomerism isn't possible. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: has three carbonyl groups, each separated by a CH2 group. Are any of them adjacent? No, so perhaps tautomerism isn't possible either. Wait, but wait: if the molecule can't rotate, maybe the conjugated system allows for some hydrogen shifting.

Alternatively, perhaps both can't tautomerize, but the question says one doesn't.

Wait, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because the three ketones are in a conjugated system, allowing for keto-enol shifts. Alternatively, perhaps it's more stable and can delocalize the electrons, but without adjacent carbonyl groups, tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, another thought: tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for a hydrogen on a carbon next to a carbonyl group to shift to the adjacent carbonyl group, creating an enol.

In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is on a benzene ring, with adjacent CH groups. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=C=O.

Wait, no— wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C=O, but the two carbonyls are opposite each other. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, in that case, the carbonyl groups are not adjacent to any CH groups that could donate a hydrogen. Wait, maybe in this case, tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary hydrogen isn't present adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl groups are in positions where a hydrogen isn't available for tautomerism.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Or the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps both can't tautomerize, but the question says one doesn't and the other does. So I need to decide.

Another way: perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone which can tautomerize. For example, in 1,3,5-triketones, tautomerism can occur by shifting a hydrogen from one position to another, leading to different enol forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are too far apart, so no tautomerism. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the triketone arrangement allows for tautomerism.

So, if the question is which one doesn't show tautomerism, that would be benzoquinone. Thus, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but in 1,3,5-trione, having three carbonyl groups, maybe tautomerism isn't possible because there's no adjacent H. Or perhaps it's possible because the molecule can have a conjugated system that allows for some shifting.

But I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

Tautomerism requires the presence of adjacent H and carbonyl groups. So, for a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it must have a structure where a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group has a hydrogen that can shift.

In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is part of the aromatic ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have hydrogens attached because they're in the ring. So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=C=O, but each C in the ring is double-bonded, so no hydrogens are available on the adjacent carbons. Thus, perhaps no tautomerism is possible.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So, each ketone is next to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 is adjacent to a ketone, meaning each may have a hydrogen that can shift, leading to tautomerism.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring with three ketones, the molecule would have CH2 groups between the ketones. So, each CH2 is between two ketones. For example, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, forming a ring.

In this case, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. So, the hydrogen on each CH2 is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps tautomerism is possible. For example, a hydrogen from the CH2 could shift to either adjacent carbonyl group, leading to enol forms.

Wait, but can a single CH2 between two ketones allow for tautomerism? Let me think about a simple case: 1,2-diketone. That would have two adjacent ketones and a CH group. The CH could lose a hydrogen, forming an enol.

In the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH2 is between two ketones. So, each CH2 has two adjacent carbonyl groups. So, perhaps a hydrogen on the CH2 can shift to either of the adjacent carbonyls, leading to different enol forms. So, the compound can tautomerize.

So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, while benzoquinone cannot.

Thus, for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

So, putting it all together:

A) A = benzoquinone. B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, wait— earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, I thought it doesn't.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking at the options, option B is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D is: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, option B would be the answer if both A and B are correct.

Yes, because A is benzoquinone (which doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which shows optical isomerism).

So, the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups and a hydrogen atom that can shift between them. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups in para positions on a benzene ring. Since the carbonyl groups are not adjacent, tautomerism is not possible. Additionally, the carbons in the benzene ring are part of a conjugated system, and no hydrogens are available on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl group is separated by a CH₂ group, and the CH₂ groups are adjacent to carbonyls. This arrangement allows for tautomerism, as hydrogens on the CH₂ groups can shift to the adjacent carbonyls. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)-CH₂-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C-2) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule is symmetric across the double bond, with identical substituents on either side. This symmetry prevents the formation of enantiomers, and thus, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It asks about two parts: part A involves determining which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

The compounds given for part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. For part B, the options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, I need to understand what tautomerism and optical isomerism are.

Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton and a atom (usually hydrogen) moves between different positions, resulting in the same molecular formula but a different structure. For example, keto-enol tautomerism is common in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups. So, if a compound can undergo tautomerism, it means it can shift a hydrogen and a double bond between two positions, creating two different tautomers.

Optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is possible when there's an asymmetric carbon— a carbon attached to four different groups. Alternatively, compounds with other forms of asymmetry, like allenes or certain ring structures, can also exhibit optical isomerism.

Okay, now let's tackle part A first.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic di-ketone. Quinones generally can tautomerize because they have two ketone groups adjacent to each other (or in a conjugated system), allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait— benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So its structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen double bonds in adjacent positions? No, wait, benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups, which are across from each other (like para positions). For example, 1,4-benzoquinone. So in that case, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other. Could that lead to tautomerism?

In benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring, but I'm not sure if they're adjacent. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5, which are every other carbon. So, like O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C? No, wait, no— wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring, each at positions 1,3,5. So that's a six-membered ring with three alternating ketones. So, that makes it a conjugated triketone, which is more likely to undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, being a di-ketone, perhaps can't tautomerize because the two ketones are not adjacent. Let me think. Tautomerism usually requires adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, in furan, which has a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's consider if benzoquinone can tautomerize. Since the two carbonyl groups are in opposite positions on the benzene ring, they are not adjacent. So, can hydrogen shift occur? If the rings are large, maybe the groups are too far apart for tautomerism to happen. So perhaps benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are too far apart for the necessary hydrogen shift.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Wait, but they are 1,3,5 positions on a six-membered ring. So, each is separated by one carbon. For example, positions 1: O=C-O, position 3: another O=C-O, etc. Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, which is a six-membered ring with three ketones every other carbon. So, this arrangement could potentially allow for keto-enol tautomerism because adjacent carbonyl groups can facilitate the tautomer shift.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system that can delocalize the electrons, but without adjacent carbonyl groups, maybe tautomerism is not possible. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Tautomerism requires that a hydrogen atom can shift between two adjacent atoms, one of which must be involved in a double bond (like a carbonyl group). So, for example, in a diketone where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent (like 1,2-diketone), the molecule can tautomerize by moving a hydrogen from the carbon next to one carbonyl to the other, forming an enol. But for that, the two carbonyls need to be next to each other.

In benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are across the ring (para positions), so they are not adjacent. Thus, they can't tautomerize because the distance is too great for the hydrogen to shift. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are every other carbon. So, they are not adjacent either. Wait, but wait—1,3,5 in a six-membered ring means each is separated by one carbon. So, they are two carbons apart, not adjacent. That would mean they are not adjacent, so tautomerism is not possible. Hmm, but wait, in a cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, can the structure allow for any kind of conjugation that would permit tautomerism? I'm a bit uncertain here.

Wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, but they're not adjacent, so they can't tautomerize. But then, which of the two compounds can't tautomerize?

Alternatively, perhaps both can or both can't. Wait, but the question states that among the two, one doesn't show tautomerism. So, we have to choose which one.

Wait, another thought: maybe benzoquinone can undergo some kind of tautomerism. Let me think about the structure. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. If they are adjacent, like in 1,2-benzoquinone, then tautomerism is possible. But benzoquinone is more commonly 1,4-benzoquinone, where the carbonyls are across the ring. So, that structure can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should recall some examples. For instance, furan derivatives can tautomerize, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. Let me think about the structure. If it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at 1,3,5 positions, then each is separated by a CH2 group. So, perhaps the carbonyl groups are in positions that allow for a conjugated system but not necessarily adjacent. So, maybe tautomerism is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't tautomerize because the necessary adjacent carbonyl groups are not present.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to part B and then come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

So, I need to check if each has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is: 

The formula is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, propanoate is the propionate ion: CH2CH2COO^-. So, the ester would be methyl propionate, but with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure would be:

O
| 
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's:

The propanoate group is CH2CH2COO^-.

But with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the carbons are: COOCH3 is the ester group, then next is CH2, then CH(OH), then another CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO^-. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoate—so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, two CH2 groups attached, and the carbonyl group.

Wait, so the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to: a hydroxyl group (OH), two CH2 groups (one leading to the ester, the other to CH3?), or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

- The first carbon is connected to the ester group (COOCH3).

- The second carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) and is connected to the third carbon (which is CH2? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon chain:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So, the structure would be: the first carbon is CH3, the second is C(OH)H, and the third is COOCH3. So, the second carbon has a hydroxyl, two CH groups (wait, no, maybe one CH and one CH3? No, perhaps not.)

Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a chiral center. The second carbon (carbon 2) has the following attached groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's connected to four different groups.

Wait, if carbon 2 is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- another CH2 group? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-. In the ester, it's CH2CH2COOCH3.

But with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)

2: CH2

3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make it a three-carbon chain with the middle carbon (carbon 2) attached to a hydroxyl group and two CH2 groups. No, wait, the middle carbon would be connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH),

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- and two H's?

Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no, that would make it a four-carbon chain. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's easier to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center.

So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four groups attached: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The ester group is at carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2 is CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, that would make the structure: CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, carbon 2 is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- CH3,

- and another CH2 group (from carbon 1). Wait, no, that can't be. Because carbon 1 is CH2(COOCH3), so carbon 2 would be connected to carbon 1 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH3), OH, and maybe another CH2? I'm not so sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is better represented as CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, that would be four carbons, but propanoate is three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that would make the central carbon (CH2) connected to:

- COOCH3 group,

- the OH group,

- two CH3 groups.

Wait, if that's the case, then the central carbon (CH2) has two CH3 groups attached. So, in that case, the central carbon would have two identical groups (CH3), making it not a chiral center. Because for a chiral center, all four attached groups must be different.

So, if the central carbon has two CH3 groups, then it can't be a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait—maybe the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain: CH3, then CHOH, then COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from carbon 1).

Wait, but in that case, the groups attached to carbon 2 would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and H.

Wait, so carbon 2 would have four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that would make it a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So, the second carbon would have:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH3,

- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, if the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups,

- and the COOCH3.

So, the groups attached would be: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3, and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the possible structures for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-.

So, when it's 2-hydroxy, the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So, the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (position 2) is CH2(OH), which is connected to two CH2 groups and an OH.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-. So, the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3?

Wait, no, because propanoate is three carbons. So, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the middle carbon is CH2(OH), connected to:

- Left: CH2 group,

- Right: COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Wait, in that case, the middle carbon has:

- CH2 group (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- two H's,

- and an OH.

So, the four groups attached to the middle carbon would be:

- CH2 (from left),

- COOCH3 (from right),

- H,

- and OH.

Wait, so that's four different groups. Hence, the middle carbon would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait— the middle carbon is CH2(OH), so it's actually CH2, which has two H's. So, the groups attached are:

- CH2 (from left: which is connected to another CH2 and then the COOCH3),

Wait, perhaps that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (C) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- and H.

So, all four groups are different: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Hence, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and hence shows optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that's not correct. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer of maleic acid, so it's HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond.

In dimethyl fumarate, both carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methyl groups, so it's CH2(COOCH3)2 in a cis configuration around the double bond.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, fumarate is CH2=CH(COOH)2. So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Ah, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but wait: fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the structure is trans or cis? Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer. So, when you draw the structure, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the molecule would have a double bond with two ester groups on the same side. Does this create any form of stereoisomerism?

In the case of a double bond, if it's a geometric isomer, that's different from optical isomerism. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

Wait, but in this structure, can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see.

If the double bond has two identical groups on each side, then the molecule would be symmetrical. But in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, perhaps another way:

The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
But that's not correct because fumarate is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond between the two central carbons.

So, correct structure:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because that would mean each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's a single bond. No. Fumarate has a double bond.

So, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2=CH.

Wait, no, the correct structure is actually:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. No, because dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester, so each carboxylic acid group is esterified with a methyl group. So, each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then it might not have a chiral center but could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral. Because an object is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry. So, in dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, each carbon in the double bond has the same substituents (COOCH3 and CH2 groups?), making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, but that would make the molecule CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond in the middle, making it CH2=CH.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2=CH with each CH2 connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that would make the molecule symmetric across the double bond, meaning it has a plane of symmetry. So, it would be achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, then looking back: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (if the structure is correct), and dimethyl fumarate doesn't. So, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure has a chiral center. But wait, in the structure I'm considering, the middle carbon is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. So, that molecule would have optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: is dimethyl fumarate planar? Since it's a trans or cis di-substituted compound. Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, it's not chiral.

So, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, going back to part A.

Which of the two compounds (benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does, then A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about both compounds' ability to tautomerize.

Benzoquinone: if it's 1,4-benzoquinone (para positions), then the two carbonyl groups are across the ring. They are not adjacent, so tautomerism isn't possible. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: has three carbonyl groups, each separated by a CH2 group. Are any of them adjacent? No, so perhaps tautomerism isn't possible either. Wait, but wait: if the molecule can't rotate, maybe the conjugated system allows for some hydrogen shifting.

Alternatively, perhaps both can't tautomerize, but the question says one doesn't.

Wait, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because the three ketones are in a conjugated system, allowing for keto-enol shifts. Alternatively, perhaps it's more stable and can delocalize the electrons, but without adjacent carbonyl groups, tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, another thought: tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for a hydrogen on a carbon next to a carbonyl group to shift to the adjacent carbonyl group, creating an enol.

In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is on a benzene ring, with adjacent CH groups. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=C=O.

Wait, no— wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C=O, but the two carbonyls are opposite each other. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, in that case, the carbonyl groups are not adjacent to any CH groups that could donate a hydrogen. Wait, maybe in this case, tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary hydrogen isn't present adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl groups are in positions where a hydrogen isn't available for tautomerism.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Or the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps both can't tautomerize, but the question says one doesn't and the other does. So I need to decide.

Another way: perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone which can tautomerize. For example, in 1,3,5-triketones, tautomerism can occur by shifting a hydrogen from one position to another, leading to different enol forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are too far apart, so no tautomerism. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the triketone arrangement allows for tautomerism.

So, if the question is which one doesn't show tautomerism, that would be benzoquinone. Thus, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but in 1,3,5-trione, having three carbonyl groups, maybe tautomerism isn't possible because there's no adjacent H. Or perhaps it's possible because the molecule can have a conjugated system that allows for some shifting.

But I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

Tautomerism requires the presence of adjacent H and carbonyl groups. So, for a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it must have a structure where a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group has a hydrogen that can shift.

In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is part of the aromatic ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have hydrogens attached because they're in the ring. So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=C=O, but each C in the ring is double-bonded, so no hydrogens are available on the adjacent carbons. Thus, perhaps no tautomerism is possible.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So, each ketone is next to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 is adjacent to a ketone, meaning each may have a hydrogen that can shift, leading to tautomerism.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring with three ketones, the molecule would have CH2 groups between the ketones. So, each CH2 is between two ketones. For example, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, forming a ring.

In this case, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. So, the hydrogen on each CH2 is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps tautomerism is possible. For example, a hydrogen from the CH2 could shift to either adjacent carbonyl group, leading to enol forms.

Wait, but can a single CH2 between two ketones allow for tautomerism? Let me think about a simple case: 1,2-diketone. That would have two adjacent ketones and a CH group. The CH could lose a hydrogen, forming an enol.

In the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH2 is between two ketones. So, each CH2 has two adjacent carbonyl groups. So, perhaps a hydrogen on the CH2 can shift to either of the adjacent carbonyls, leading to different enol forms. So, the compound can tautomerize.

So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, while benzoquinone cannot.

Thus, for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

So, putting it all together:

A) A = benzoquinone. B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, wait— earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, I thought it doesn't.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking at the options, option B is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D is: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, option B would be the answer if both A and B are correct.

Yes, because A is benzoquinone (which doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which shows optical isomerism).

So, the correct answer would be option B.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups and a hydrogen atom that can shift between them. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups in para positions on a benzene ring. Since the carbonyl groups are not adjacent, tautomerism is not possible. Additionally, the carbons in the benzene ring are part of a conjugated system, and no hydrogens are available on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl group is separated by a CH₂ group, and the CH₂ groups are adjacent to carbonyls. This arrangement allows for tautomerism, as hydrogens on the CH₂ groups can shift to the adjacent carbonyls. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)-CH₂-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C-2) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule is symmetric across the double bond, with identical substituents on either side. This symmetry prevents the formation of enantiomers, and thus, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.
