Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see... the question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. The question is about how many peaks they'll see in each case.

Hmm, what do I remember about mCPBA? Oh right, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, so it's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes forms an epoxide. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond to form an epoxide.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene reacting with mCPBA, and Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid. Both reactions go to completion.

I recall that epoxidation with mCPBA is a stereospecific reaction. For each alkene, the configuration of the double bond affects the structure of the epoxide formed. Let me think about (E) and (Z) alkenes. (E) is trans, (Z) is cis.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is peracid addition, which is an electrocyclic process. Wait, no, more accurately, it's a cyclic transition state where the peracid attacks the alkene to form the epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but in the case of epoxidation, the endo rule might come into play, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a trans epoxide from a trans alkene, or maybe something else.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both sides of the double bond. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other, while for (Z), they are on the same side.

When mCPBA adds to the double bond, the oxygen adds across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the addition depends on whether the starting alkene is E or Z.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about how the epoxide forms. The transition state for the epoxidation involves the peracid (mCPBA) attacking the alkene in a way that the oxygen adds across the double bond with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about this. For each double bond configuration, E and Z, the epoxidation would lead to specific epoxide structures.

But wait, maybe the product is the same in both cases. No, that doesn't make sense. Because if you start with E and Z alkenes, the epoxide formed would have different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two methyl groups (or whatever substituents) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring, whereas the (Z) would have them on the same side. Or maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either end of the double bond. So it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 on each end. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on carbons 4 and 5. Let me draw it.

Actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2 on carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons, so positions 1-8. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to imagine as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but as a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps I should not get bogged down in the exact structure. Let me think about the outcome of the reactions.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → treated with mCPBA → forms an epoxide. Then, treated with aqueous acid. Oh wait, when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening reactions.

Wait, so the first step is epoxidation, the second is acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide.

Wait, right. So the process is: alkene → epoxide → epoxide ring-opening under acid conditions.

So, for each starting alkene (E and Z), we get an epoxide, and then each epoxide ring-opening under acid gives diol.

Wait, but the epoxide structure would be different for E and Z alkenes, so the diol structures would differ as well.

Wait, but perhaps in each case, the diol would form in a way that leads to either a racemic mixture or some other stereochemistry.

Wait, let me think. For each starting alkene, mCPBA forms an epoxide. Then, in aqueous acid, the epoxide opens. How does that happen?

Epoxide ring-opening under acid conditions typically leads to the formation of a diol. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon (since it's more electrophilic) in a process that follows Markovnikov's rule.

Wait, but in the case of symmetrical epoxides, the ring-opening would be the same on both sides, leading to the same product.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), so their epoxides would be different. Let me think about that.

(E)-oct-4-ene: The double bond is between C4 and C5, with substituents (like CH2CH2 groups) on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide. Because the starting alkene is trans (E), the epoxide will have the two substituents (like ethyl groups) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Wait, but E and Z would lead to different epoxide structures. Let me imagine the (E) isomer, trans, so when the epoxide forms, the two substituents (like CH2CH2-) are on opposite faces. So when the epoxide ring opens, perhaps the diol formed will have specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon, which is the same on both sides of the epoxide because the epoxide is symmetric? Or is the epoxide symmetric?

Wait, oct-4-ene is between two CH2 groups on each end. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2CH2 in the middle. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 is not right because that's a straight chain. The double bond is in the middle, so each end is CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond is connected to two CH2 groups. That makes the epoxide symmetric.

Wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then ring-opening would lead to a diol with two identical stereocenters? Or perhaps no stereocenters, or maybe the diol would be a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about a specific example. Let's say the epoxide is between C4 and C5, and both ends are CH2 groups. So the epoxide structure is symmetric.

When you protonate the epoxide oxygen, the ring becomes more strained, and the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. But in a symmetric epoxide, both sides are the same. So the attack can happen from either side, leading to a racemic mixture or perhaps a single product.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the attack would lead to a diol where the two stereocenters are mirror images, leading to a meso compound. Because, for example, in the epoxide of cyclohexene, when you open it with acid, you get a diol that is meso (like in the case of cis diol).

Wait, no, wait. Let me take a specific example. If the epoxide is formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, the epoxide would have the substituents (like CH2CH3 groups) on opposite sides. When it opens with acid, the water would attack each carbon, leading to two new stereocenters.

But since the epoxide is symmetric (because each carbon is attached to two CH2 groups), the attack on either carbon would lead to the same product. So the diol would have two stereocenters, but they would be in a meso form, meaning the molecule is achiral despite having stereocenters.

Wait, that sounds right. So when an epoxide derived from a trans alkene (E) is treated with acid, the diol formed is a meso compound. Because the two stereocenters are mirror images, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Similarly, what about the (Z) isomer? The (Z) alkene is cis, so when mCPBA adds across the double bond, the substituents (CH2 groups) are on the same side. So the epoxide formed would have the two substituents on the same face.

Wait, but in this case, the epoxide is again symmetric because both ends are CH2 groups. So when the epoxide is opened in acid, the diol formed would have the two stereocenters on the same face. But would that lead to a meso compound as well?

Wait, no. If the epoxide is formed from a cis alkene, the substituents are on the same face. So when the epoxide ring opens, the attack would lead to a diol where the two OH groups are on the same face of the former double bond.

Wait, but in an oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end are CH2 groups. So when the epoxide is formed from the Z isomer, the substituents (like CH2CH2-) are on the same face. So when the epoxide is opened, which substituent gets the OH groups?

Wait, perhaps I should draw this. But since I can't, I'll try to visualize.

Epoxide from E isomer: substituents on opposite sides.
Epoxide from Z isomer: substituents on same sides.

But in both cases, the epoxide is symmetric because each end is CH2 groups. So when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens with water attacking each carbon.

In the E-derived epoxide (trans), when the epoxide opens, the OH groups would be on opposite sides, leading to a meso diol.

In the Z-derived epoxide (cis), the OH groups would be on the same side, leading to a diastereomeric mixture. Wait, but no, because the epoxide is symmetric. Wait, maybe in this case, the diol would not be a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's think again.

In the E case:

Epoxide structure: substituents (like CH2CH3) on opposite faces.

When the epoxide opens, each carbon is attacked by water. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the attack can happen from either side, but the product will have two OH groups on opposite faces, leading to a meso compound.

In the Z case:

Epoxide substituents are on the same face. So when the epoxide opens, each carbon is attacked by water from the same face. So the OH groups are on the same face, which would lead to a diol with both OHs on the same side. But wait, since the epoxide is symmetric, would that lead to a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture?

Wait, no, because in the case of the Z-derived epoxide, the substituents are on the same face, so the epoxide is not symmetric, but wait, no. Wait, the substituents are CH2 groups on each end. If the substituents are the same on each side, the epoxide is symmetric regardless of the configuration. So whether it's E or Z, the epoxide is symmetric.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the double bond's geometry affects the substituents' positions. So for E, substituents are opposite; for Z, same side. But in both cases, each substituent is CH2 groups, so the epoxide is symmetric.

Wait, that's a key point. So in both cases, the epoxide is symmetric. Therefore, when the epoxide opens, the diol will have two stereocenters, but they are either both R and S or both S and R, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, but wait. No, that can't be right. Let me think again.

In the E case: the epoxide is formed from a trans double bond, so the substituents are on opposite faces of the epoxide ring. When the epoxide opens, the attack occurs on each carbon from the opposite side, leading to the diol with the OH groups on opposite faces. This would result in a meso compound because the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry.

In the Z case: the epoxide is formed from a cis double bond. So the substituents are on the same face of the epoxide ring. When the epoxide opens, the attack occurs on each carbon from the same face, leading to both OH groups on the same face. But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, wouldn't this result in a different stereochemistry?

Wait, no. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack from each carbon's same face would lead to a diol where the OHs are on the same face, but the molecule would still have a plane of symmetry. So perhaps the diol is achiral as well.

Wait, no. Because if the substituents are same on each side, the diol would be a meso compound regardless of how the epoxide was formed.

Wait, perhaps both reactions lead to the same diol, but that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the actual products.

For (E)-oct-4-ene:

Epoxidation with mCPBA forms an epoxide where the substituents are trans. Then, in aqueous acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol. Since the epoxide was symmetric, the diol will be a meso compound.

For (Z)-oct-4-ene:

Epoxidation with mCPBA forms an epoxide where the substituents are cis. Then, in aqueous acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol. Again, because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol is a meso compound.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different. Both would form the same diol? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the Z-epoxide would not be a meso compound. Let me think: if the epoxide is formed from a cis double bond, the substituents are on the same face. So when the epoxide opens, the OH groups would form on the same face, leading to a diol with adjacent OH groups on the same side.

Wait, but in that case, the molecule would have two stereocenters. For example, imagine the diol as HOCH2CH2-CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, no, the actual structure would be HO-C-C-O in the epoxide, then after opening, it's HO-C-C-OH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the diol as a 1,2-diol. For a symmetric epoxide, the diol would have the same configuration on both ends. So for the E-derived epoxide, the diol would be a meso compound (because the two stereocenters are mirror images), while the Z-derived epoxide would form a diol that's a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. Because if the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening would lead to a single product. So for both E and Z, the diol would be a meso compound.

But that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the products are different. Let me think: when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the epoxide has the substituents (CH2CH2-) on opposite faces. When ring-opening occurs, each OH group adds to opposite faces, leading to a diol that's a meso compound.

When (Z)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the substituents are on the same face. When the ring opens, the OH groups add to the same face, leading to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then opening it would form a single product. But if the substituents are on the same face, the diol would have the same configuration on both ends, leading to a compound without a plane of symmetry, thus being chiral.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have both OH groups on the same face, making it a chiral compound. Because the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let me clarify.

In the (E)-epoxide, substituents are opposite. When the epoxide ring opens, the diol would have OH groups on opposite sides, leading to a meso compound.

In the (Z)-epoxide, substituents are same. When the epoxide opens, the diol would have OH groups on the same side, leading to a diol that is chiral. Because the two OHs are on the same side, but the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are same on both ends, but the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol from the (Z) epoxide would have two stereocenters where both are R or both are S, making it a meso compound as well.

No, that's not right. Let me think: if the diol from the (Z) epoxide has both OH groups on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's HO-O-C-C-O-OH (simplified), but in reality, the structure would be something like HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's not symmetric. Because the substituents on each stereocenter are the same. Each stereocenter has two CH2 groups and two OH groups, right?

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Let's say the diol is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's not correct. Wait, the diol comes from the epoxide, which is between C4 and C5. So the structure would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a 4,5-diol.

In the case of the (E) epoxide, the diol would have the OH groups on opposite sides, leading to a meso compound. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C4 and C5, making it achiral.

In the (Z) epoxide, the diol would have both OH groups on the same side, making the molecule chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Because each stereocenter would have the same configuration, leading to a pair of enantiomers. But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then both diastereomers would form in equal amounts, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, no, because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack would lead to the same product regardless of which face is attacked.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

Let's imagine that Reaction 1 produces a meso diol from the (E) epoxide, and Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol from the (Z) epoxide.

But wait, no. Because when the epoxide is symmetric, as in both cases, the ring opening would lead to a meso compound regardless of the starting E or Z.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting E and Z would form different diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (E) is a meso compound (achiral), and the diol from (Z) is also a meso compound, but different from the first. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps both reactions produce the same diol, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the epoxide and the resulting diol.

Epoxidation with mCPBA is a syn addition. So the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. Therefore, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond via a cyclic transition state where the peracid's oxygen adds to the same face (syn addition). So for a trans (E) alkene, the addition would lead to an epoxide where the substituents are on the same face. Wait, that can't be right because the starting alkene is trans.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the addition of mCPBA leads to the epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the substituents on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Then, when the epoxide opens, the diol's configuration depends on the attack of water.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

In any case, the key point is whether the diols formed from each reaction are chiral or achiral.

Assume that Reaction 1 produces a meso diol (achiral), and Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol. Then, when combined, you have two different diols, one achiral and one chiral.

Wait, but if both diols are the same, then combining them wouldn't change anything. So perhaps each reaction produces a different diol.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer of the same diol.

But let me think again: the starting alkenes are E and Z. Each forms an epoxide, which upon acid treatment forms a diol.

In each case, the diol's stereochemistry depends on how the epoxide is formed.

If the epoxide is symmetric, the diol could be meso (achiral). If the epoxide isn't symmetric, the diol could be chiral.

Wait, but both E and Z oct-4-ene are symmetric alkenes. Because each end of the double bond is two CH2 groups. So the epoxide would be symmetric in both cases. So when the epoxide opens, the diol would be a meso compound in both cases.

Wait, but that would mean both reactions produce the same product, which is a meso diol. But that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different.

Wait, no. Maybe the diols are different. Wait, perhaps the diols are different because the epoxide structures are different, but the diols are the same.

Wait, perhaps both reactions lead to the same diol, which is a meso compound. So when you combine the products, you only have one product.

But that can't be correct because the starting alkenes are different. Let me think, for example, (E)- and (Z)-but-2-ene.

But-2-ene (E) is trans, and (Z) is cis. When epoxidized, each forms a different epoxide. Then, when treated with acid, each epoxide forms a diol. For but-2-ene, the diol from the trans epoxide is meso, while the diol from the cis epoxide is also a meso compound.

Wait, no. Let me think: (E)-but-2-ene would form an epoxide where the substituents (like CH3) are on opposite sides. Then, upon ring-opening, the diol would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, which is meso. Similarly, (Z)-but-2-ene would form an epoxide where substituents are on the same side. Upon ring-opening, the diol is also meso. So both reactions give the same meso diol.

Wait, that's possible. So in that case, both reactions would produce the same product, which is a meso compound. So when combined, the products are the same, leading to a single product.

But in the question, the starting alkenes are oct-4-ene, which is symmetric. So the same reasoning applies: both (E) and (Z) would form the same meso diol upon reaction.

So when you combine the products, you have a single product. Then, when run on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, you'd get a single peak. On a chiral HPLC column, since the product is achiral, it would also give a single peak.

But looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both HPLCs, which doesn't fit. Wait, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 in chiral

C) 2 peaks in both

D) 3 in standard and 4 in chiral.

Hmm, none of these options suggest 1 peak in either case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that both reactions produce the same product.

Alternative approach: perhaps the epoxidation leads to different diastereomers, and upon ring-opening, each gives a different diol.

Wait, maybe the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z) is a chiral compound.

Wait, but how?

If the diol from (E) is meso, then it's achiral. The diol from (Z) would have two stereocenters that are not mirror images, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps. Let me think: suppose the diol from (E) is meso, and the diol from (Z) is a pair of enantiomers.

But if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol from (Z) would be a meso compound as well. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the diol structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have the OH groups on opposite sides, making it a meso compound. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have the OH groups on the same side, but because the molecule is symmetric, it's also a meso compound. So both diols are meso, leading to the same product.

Wait, but that can't be, because the starting alkenes are different. So perhaps the diols are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (Z) is chiral, and the diol from (E) is meso. So combining them would give two different diols: one meso (achiral) and one chiral (existing as two enantiomers).

Wait, but if the diol from (Z) is chiral, then it exists as two enantiomers. So when the products are combined, you have two products: one meso diol and a racemic mixture of the chiral diol.

Wait, but that would mean in the mixture, you have the meso diol and a pair of enantiomers. So when run on a standard (achiral) HPLC, they would see two peaks: one for the meso compound and another for the pair of enantiomers (which would co-elute on an achiral column). On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomers would separate into two peaks, while the meso compound would elute as a single peak. So total peaks: on standard HPLC, 2; on chiral, 3.

Wait, that's option B: 2 in standard, 3 in chiral.

But let me double-check.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → meso diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → chiral diol (which would be a racemic mixture, but since both R and S forms are present, they would combine into a single peak on an achiral column but split into two on a chiral column).

Wait, but the products of Reaction 2 are a racemic mixture, but when combined, since both R and S are present, on a chiral column, they would show as two peaks. But the meso compound from Reaction 1 would be a single peak on both columns.

Wait, no. The diol from Reaction 2 is a chiral molecule, so it would produce two enantiomers. When you have a racemic mixture, on a standard HPLC, it runs as a single peak because the column doesn't distinguish enantiomers. On a chiral column, the enantiomers separate into two peaks.

So the combined product mixture would have two components: the meso diol (1 peak on both columns) and the racemic diol (1 peak on standard, 2 peaks on chiral).

So total peaks: on standard HPLC, 1 (meso) + 1 (racemic) = 2 peaks.

On chiral HPLC, 1 (meso) + 2 (enantiomers) = 3 peaks.

So the answer would be option B: 2 in standard and 3 in chiral.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction 2's product is a single enantiomer, but I think that's not the case because the reaction is done with one equivalent of mCPBA and goes to completion, but I'm not sure about the stereochemistry.

Wait, no, the reaction of the (Z) epoxide would produce a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but in equal amounts. So the product is a racemic mixture.

So when combined with the meso diol from Reaction 1, the mixture has two components: the meso diol and the racemic diol.

On a standard HPLC, the racemic diol would run as a single peak, and the meso as another. So two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, the racemic diol would split into two peaks (R and S), while the meso remains as one. So three peaks in total.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The products are combined and analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each case.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via stereospecific syn addition. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) determines the configuration of the epoxide.
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide leads to the formation of a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

2. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**:
   - The (E) configuration of the starting alkene results in an epoxide with substituents on opposite sides of the ring.
   - Upon acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the diol formed is a **meso compound** due to the internal plane of symmetry. This compound is **achiral**.

3. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**:
   - The (Z) configuration of the starting alkene results in an epoxide with substituents on the same side of the ring.
   - Upon acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the diol formed is **chiral** because it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This diol exists as a **racemic mixture** (two enantiomers in equal amounts).

4. **Combining the Products**:
   - The combined product mixture contains:
     - One meso diol (achiral) from Reaction 1.
     - A racemic mixture of a chiral diol from Reaction 2.

5. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:
     - The meso diol appears as a single peak.
     - The racemic mixture of the chiral diol also appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot distinguish enantiomers.
     - Total peaks: **2**.
   - **Chiral HPLC**:
     - The meso diol appears as a single peak.
     - The racemic mixture of the chiral diol separates into two distinct peaks (one for each enantiomer).
     - Total peaks: **3**.

### Conclusion:
The chemist observes **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC.

ANSWER: B
