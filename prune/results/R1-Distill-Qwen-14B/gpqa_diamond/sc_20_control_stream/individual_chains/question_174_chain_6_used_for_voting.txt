Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei fission. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The more massive one has twice the mass of the other, and together their rest masses sum up to 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, let's list out the given info:

- Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV (so M = 300 GeV / c², but maybe I don't need to worry about c² here since we're dealing with rest masses and energies in the same units).
- Splits into two fragments. Let's call them Fragment 1 (heavier) and Fragment 2 (lighter).
- Fragment 1 is twice as massive as Fragment 2. So if Fragment 2's mass is m, Fragment 1 is 2m.
- The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M => 3m = 0.99 M => m = 0.33 M. So Fragment 1 is 0.66 M, Fragment 2 is 0.33 M.

Wait, wait. But the initial nucleus's rest mass is 300 GeV. So the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 * M. So the total mass after fission is less than before, which means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in reality, when a nucleus fissions, it releases energy, so the rest mass of the products is less than the parent nucleus, and that difference is the energy released, going into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy in the fragments, but in this problem, the question focuses on the kinetic energies.

So to find the kinetic energies, I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think. Let's denote:

Fragment 1: mass m1 = 2m = (2/3)*0.99 M = 0.66 M.
Fragment 2: mass m2 = m = 0.33 M.

But wait, that's their rest masses. Their relativistic masses would be higher because of their kinetic energies, but since the problem is about their kinetic energies, perhaps I can model this using conservation of four-momentum or just relativistic energy and momentum.

Wait, the problem is asking for the correct T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and compare it to the non-relativistic approximation. So perhaps the non-relativistic case is easier, and then I can compute the relativistic case and find the difference.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But in reality, because the velocities might be significant fractions of the speed of light, the relativistic effects would be important, so the actual KE would be higher than the classical approximation. So the difference would be T1 (relativistic) minus T1 (classical).

But first, let's figure out the velocities and kinetic energies.

Wait, but let's think about the energy and momentum.

The initial total energy is the rest energy of the nucleus, which is 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies, plus any binding energy (but the problem states to ignore electrons, so perhaps just the rest mass and kinetic energies).

So total energy after fission is:

E_total = m1 c² + K1 + m2 c² + K2.

Wait, but since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So the relativistic momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So for each fragment, relativistic momentum p = gamma m v.

So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And p1 = - p2 (since they move in opposite directions).

But in terms of magnitude, p1 = p2.

So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the easiest approach. Maybe it's better to use conservation of energy and momentum, considering that the initial momentum is zero.

Here's another approach: since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momentum of Fragment 1 equals the negative of the momentum of Fragment 2.

In terms of relativistic equations, for each fragment, the energy is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So the total energy is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2 ) = 300 GeV.

Because p1 = p and p2 = -p, so their magnitudes are the same. Let me denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of Fragment 1, and Fragment 2 has the same p.

Wait, no. Because the masses are different, but their momenta have the same magnitude. So p1 = p, p2 = p (but opposite directions, so momenta vectors are -p each).

Wait, no. Wait, the momentum vectors are opposite, so |p1| = |p2| = p.

So for Fragment 1: E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 )

Fragment 2: E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2 )

So the sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2 ) = 300 GeV.

Hmm, solving this equation for p is a bit tricky, but perhaps I can square both sides or find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M, so the rest energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the remaining 3 GeV (300 - 297) must be the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the initial state, the energy is all rest mass energy (300 GeV). After fission, the rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the kinetic energy released is 3 GeV, which is distributed between the two fragments.

So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Now, I need to find K1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

Also, since the system's momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the momentum of Fragment 1 is p = gamma1 m1 v1,

and Fragment 2's momentum is p2 = gamma2 m2 v2 = -p.

But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal, so |p1| = |p2|.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since the two are moving in opposite directions, their velocities are v and -v', but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of their speeds.

Wait, but if I consider the magnitudes, then gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, but this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum.

Wait, the kinetic energy of each fragment is (gamma -1) m c².

But another approach is to model each fragment's energy and momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equations for each fragment.

So, for Fragment 1:

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) = m1 c² + K1.

Similarly, Fragment 2:

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 ) = m2 c² + K2.

Wait, but that's not correct because E is the total energy, which includes rest mass plus kinetic. So E = mc² + K.

So,

E1 = m1 c² + K1,

E2 = m2 c² + K2.

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

(m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2) = 300 GeV.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M,

so,

0.99 * 300 GeV + (K1 + K2) = 300 GeV.

Which gives K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So that's a key equation.

Now, another equation is from momentum conservation. The momenta must be equal and opposite, so p1 = -p2.

The magnitude of momentum p for each fragment can be expressed in terms of their kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express p in terms of each fragment's energy.

From the energy equation for Fragment 1:

E1^2 = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2.

Solving for (p c):

p c = sqrt( E1^2 - (m1 c²)^2 )

Similarly for Fragment 2.

But since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal, so:

sqrt( E1^2 - (m1 c²)^2 ) = sqrt( E2^2 - (m2 c²)^2 )

Because p is the magnitude.

Hmm, but substituting E1 and E2:

E1 = m1 c² + K1,

E2 = m2 c² + K2.

So,

sqrt( (m1 c² + K1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (m2 c² + K2)^2 - (m2 c²)^2 )

Simplify inside the square roots:

For Fragment 1:

(m1 c² + K1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 = (m1 c²)^2 + 2 m1 c² K1 + K1² - (m1 c²)^2 = 2 m1 c² K1 + K1².

Similarly, for Fragment 2:

= 2 m2 c² K2 + K2^2.

So,

sqrt( 2 m1 c² K1 + K1^2 ) = sqrt( 2 m2 c² K2 + K2^2 )

Squaring both sides:

2 m1 c² K1 + K1^2 = 2 m2 c² K2 + K2^2.

But this seems a bit complicated because we have two variables (K1, K2) and a third equation (K1 + K2 = 3 GeV).

Wait, but we also know the ratio of masses. m1 = 2 m2.

Because m1 is twice as massive as m2.

Wait, earlier I found that m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M. So m1 = 2 m2.

So, m1 = 2 m2.

So, let me set m2 = x, so m1 = 2x.

The sum m1 + m2 = 3x = 0.99 M => x = 0.33 M.

So, m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Let me write the masses in terms of M:

m1 = (2/3) * 0.99 M = 0.66 M,

m2 = (1/3) * 0.99 M = 0.33 M.

But perhaps it's better to express everything in GeV/c² units.

Wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass energy of 300 GeV, so M c² = 300 GeV.

So m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV,

m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So, E1 = 198 GeV + K1,

E2 = 99 GeV + K2.

We know that E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

So,

(198 + K1) + (99 + K2) = 300,

Which gives K1 + K2 = 3 GeV (which matches what I found earlier).

Now, the other equation from momentum conservation is:

2 m1 c² K1 + K1^2 = 2 m2 c² K2 + K2^2.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2,

So,

2*(2 m2) c² K1 + K1^2 = 2 m2 c² K2 + K2^2.

Simplify:

4 m2 c² K1 + K1^2 = 2 m2 c² K2 + K2^2.

Let me factor out m2 c² on both sides. Let me denote m2 c² as m2c² = 99 GeV.

So,

4 * 99 * K1 + K1^2 = 2 * 99 * K2 + K2^2.

Simplify:

396 K1 + K1² = 198 K2 + K2².

Hmm, but since K1 + K2 =3 GeV, perhaps I can express K2 = 3 - K1.

Substituting K2 = 3 - K1 into the equation:

396 K1 + K1² = 198 (3 - K1) + (3 - K1)^2.

Expanding the right side:

198*(3) = 594,

198*(-K1) = -198 K1,

(3 - K1)^2 = 9 -6 K1 + K1².

So,

396 K1 + K1² = 594 -198 K1 +9 -6 K1 + K1².

Simplify the right side:

594 +9 = 603,

-198 K1 -6 K1 = -204 K1,

So,

396 K1 + K1² = 603 -204 K1 + K1².

Subtract K1² from both sides:

396 K1 = 603 -204 K1.

Combine like terms:

396 K1 +204 K1 = 603,

600 K1 = 603,

K1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.

So K1 is 1.005 GeV, which is 1005 MeV. Hmm, but wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 1.005 GeV is 1005 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations, because 3 GeV is only the total kinetic energy, and 1.005 GeV seems plausible for K1.

But wait, K1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is the one that's moving slower, right? Because in the non-relativistic case, the lighter fragment would have higher velocity. But in the relativistic case, it's not as straightforward.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So K1 is 1.005 GeV, which is 1005 MeV.

Now, the non-relativistic approximation would have used (1/2) m v² for KE. But how would that compare?

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the same scenario would have:

- The same rest masses, same initial energy.

- Same total kinetic energy (3 GeV), same momentum conservation.

In the non-relativistic case, the velocities are much lower, so gamma is approximately 1.

So in non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

And the momentum p = m v.

So, for each fragment, p = m v.

So, for Fragment 1, p = m1 v1,

Fragment 2, p = m2 v2.

But momentum conservation gives p1 = p2, since initial momentum is zero.

So m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Because p1 = m1 v1,

p2 = m2 v2,

and p1 = p2 (same magnitude, opposite direction).

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So, v2 = (m1 / m2) v1.

But m1 = 2 m2, so v2 = 2 v1.

So, v2 is twice as fast as v1.

Now, the kinetic energies in non-relativistic case are:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2^2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1^2 = 2 m2 v1^2.

But K1 + K2 = 3 GeV,

So,

(1/2 m1 v1^2) + (2 m2 v1^2) =3 GeV.

But m1 = 2 m2,

so,

(1/2)(2 m2) v1^2 + 2 m2 v1^2 =3 GeV,

which is,

( m2 v1^2 ) + 2 m2 v1^2 =3 GeV,

So,

3 m2 v1^2 =3 GeV,

=> m2 v1^2 =1 GeV.

But m2 = 0.33 M,

Wait, but M c² =300 GeV,

so m2 c² =99 GeV,

so m2 = (99 GeV) / c².

But in non-relativistic, m2 v1^2 =1 GeV.

Wait, but m2 is in GeV/c², and v1^2 has units (dimensionless? Because when using c=1 units, v is in terms of c).

Wait, perhaps I should better manage the units.

Wait, in natural units where c=1,

momentum p has units GeV/c,

but since we're using c=1,

p = m v, where m is in GeV/c² and v is in terms of c (so v is dimensionless, 0 <= v <1).

So, in non-relativistic case, m v^2 would have units GeV/c² * (dimensionless)² = GeV/c²,

but KE is (1/2) m v^2, which in units would be (GeV/c²)(v^2 ) * c^2 [since KE is in GeV],

so (1/2) m v^2 c^2 = (1/2) (GeV/c²) (v^2) c^2 = (1/2) GeV v^2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

In any case, let's proceed.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2^2,

with v2 = 2 v1.

So, K2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1^2 = 2 m2 v1^2.

So,

K1 + K2 = (1/2 m1 v1^2 ) + 2 m2 v1^2.

But m1=2m2,

so,

(1/2 * 2 m2 v1^2 ) + 2 m2 v1^2 = (m2 v1^2) + 2 m2 v1^2 = 3 m2 v1^2 =3 GeV.

So,

m2 v1^2 =1 GeV.

So,

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2)(2 m2) v1^2 = m2 v1^2 =1 GeV.

So, in the non-relativistic approximation, K1 (classical) is 1 GeV.

But in the correct relativistic case, we found K1 =1.005 GeV.

So, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is 1.005 GeV -1 GeV= 0.005 GeV.

0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV.

So the difference is 5 MeV, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using relativistic energy and momentum conservation principles and compare the result with the non-relativistic approximation.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial nucleus**: Rest mass energy = 300 GeV, at rest.
2. **Fission products**:
   - Fragment 1 (more massive): Rest mass = \( 2m \), where \( m \) is the rest mass of Fragment 2.
   - Fragment 2 (less massive): Rest mass = \( m \).
   - Total rest mass of fragments = \( 0.99M \), where \( M \) is the initial mass of the nucleus.
   - Thus, \( 3m = 0.99M \), so \( m = 0.33M \) and \( 2m = 0.66M \).

3. **Energy released**: The initial rest energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest energy of the fragments is \( 0.99M \cdot c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \). The remaining energy (\( 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) is the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

4. **Kinetic energy distribution**: Let \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) be the kinetic energies of Fragment 1 and Fragment 2, respectively. From energy conservation:
   \[
   K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

5. **Momentum conservation**: Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal:
   \[
   \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Relativistic Analysis:
The total energy of each fragment is:
\[
E_1 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_1 c^2)^2}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2}.
\]
The total energy is:
\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Substituting \( E_1 = m_1 c^2 + K_1 \) and \( E_2 = m_2 c^2 + K_2 \), and using \( m_1 = 0.66M \), \( m_2 = 0.33M \), and \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:
\[
m_1 c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV}, \quad m_2 c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
(198 + K_1) + (99 + K_2) = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

From momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal:
\[
\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_1 c^2)^2} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2}.
\]
Squaring and simplifying:
\[
2 m_1 c^2 K_1 + K_1^2 = 2 m_2 c^2 K_2 + K_2^2.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), \( K_2 = 3 - K_1 \), and solving, we find:
\[
K_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation:
In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \), and momentum conservation gives:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we find \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). The total kinetic energy is:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Substituting \( K_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 \) and \( K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 \), and solving, we find:
\[
K_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Results:
The difference in \( K_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta K_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.
