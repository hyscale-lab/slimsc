Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states and pure states. So I need to figure out where this particular ρ is located in the qubit space. The options are four points in 3D space, so I guess this relates to how density matrices can be represented geometrically.

Wait, I think about the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a single qubit, any state can be written as a vector on the Bloch sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a state vector. So how do density matrices map to the Bloch sphere?

I recall that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere where the coordinates are determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) with |r| ≤1.

So, let's compute the components of r. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. To find r, I need to compute the expectation values of each σ_i, which can be found via Tr(ρ σ_i).

Wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write that out in matrix form to make it clearer. |0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

So ρ is a 2x2 identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. Now, let's compute the expectation values. For each Pauli matrix σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z.

But wait, since ρ is (I)/2, let's compute Tr(ρ σ_i) for each i.

Tr(ρ σ_i) = Tr( (I/2) σ_i ) = (1/2) Tr(σ_i). But the Pauli matrices have trace zero because their diagonal elements are 0 and 0 (σ_x) wait, no: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So their traces are all zero. So Tr(ρ σ_i) is zero for each i.

Wait, but the general density matrix is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if all the Tr(ρ σ_i) are zero, then r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero.

So the vector r is (0,0,0), which would be the origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, isn't the density matrix for a completely mixed state at the origin? Because a completely mixed state can't be described by a pure state on the Bloch sphere—it's the maximally mixed state. So in this case, ρ is maximally mixed because it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That means it's equally likely to be in state |0> or |1>, so the state is completely mixed, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector with \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \), and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. The components of \( \mathbf{r} \) are determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, given by \( r_i = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_i) \).

For the given \( \rho \), we compute the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \). Since \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), the trace \( \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_i) \) becomes 

\[
\text{Tr}\left(\frac{I}{2} \sigma_i\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_i).
\]

The Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \) all have zero trace. Therefore, \( r_x = r_y = r_z = 0 \), and the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]
