Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using different reducing agents on two unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, the products are (R) and (S) respectively. So A reacts with LiBH4 and H+ to give R, and B reacts with BH3 and H+ to give S. Hmm, or wait, let me check the question again.

Wait no, the question states:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So A with LiBH4 gives R product, and B with BH3 gives S product. So I need to figure out what A and B are.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different stereo configurations for compounds A and B.

The options for A and B are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with either S or R configuration.

Wait, let me think about the reactions here. The products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. That structure sounds like a cyclic ketone, perhaps a lactone or something similar. Let me visualize it: 4-ethyl, so the substituents are on the 4 position. So the ring is a six-membered ring, I think, with the ketone at position 2. So the structure is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar?

Wait, but how are these products formed from the starting materials? The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me draw that. So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, wait, pentanoic acid has five carbons, so positions 1 to 5. So position 5 is the carboxylic acid. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Wait, let me number from the COOH group as position 1, but wait, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, where the COOH is on C5, and the chain is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think of 5-oxopentanoic acid. That would have a ketone at C5. So the structure would be:

CH2(CO2H)CH2CH2CO

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid has five carbons, with the COOH on the first carbon. Wait, no, wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes the numbering is such that the functional group gets the lowest number, so the COOH is on carbon 1, and the other groups are on higher carbons.

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine it as:

The main chain is a pentanoic acid, so five carbons with COOH on C5. So positions are C1 to C5, with COOH on C5. But that doesn't make sense because pentanoic is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons including the COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's hexanoic acid. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more like:

The structure is: 

O
||
O-C-O-isobutyl group on carbon 5, which is the same as the ketone. Wait, no, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So on carbon 5, there's both an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo group). Wait, but wait, that's impossible because a ketone is a carbonyl, so the carbon can't have two substituents. Oh wait, wait, no, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, carbon 5 is the last carbon of the pentanoic acid, which is the COOH. So perhaps that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is pentanoic acid, so five carbons with COOH on C1. Then, substituents at C3 and C5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(O-CH2CH(CH2)2)-CH(CH2CH2) -CH2- ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it out.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid part is: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Another way: the pentanoic acid has five carbons. The substituents are on C3 (ethyl) and C5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Hmm. Wait, but the 5-oxo indicates a ketone on C5. But in a pentanoic acid, the COOH is on C1, so C5 would be the end. So the structure would be:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3 ethyl) - C(O-CH(CH2)2) (C4) - C(O) (C5 ketone). Wait, that doesn't make sense because C5 is the last carbon, so it can't have a COOH and a ketone. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an ether group and an ester or something that can undergo reduction. Wait, but the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring, oxygen as part of the ring, with the ketone at position 2. The substituent at position 4 is an ethyl group. So the ring has an oxygen in it, making it a tetrahydropyran derivative.

So when the starting material is treated with a reducing agent, perhaps it's undergoing a reduction that forms a ring. Wait, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation product that's being reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether that's being opened, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group, but that's not matching the given options. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester or something that can undergo cyclic hemiacetal formation upon reduction.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically used for reductions like in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, whereas LiBH4 is a general reducing agent for carbonyls.

Wait, but in the context of ketone reductions, both LiBH4 and BH3 (with a proton source) can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but how does that lead to a cyclic product?

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are causing ring-opening. Hmm, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enol ethers or something that can undergo ring-forming upon reduction. Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a β-keto ester, which can undergo a cyclization when reduced. Oh, wait, when a β-keto ester is reduced, maybe it forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Wait, let's think about the product. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So that's a five-membered ring? No, wait, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So the ring has six atoms: five carbons and one oxygen.

So, the product has a ring structure with a ketone at position 2. So, the structure is O in position 1, then carbons 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, and 6.

So, how do we get from the starting material to this product?

Perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a β-keto ester with an ethyl group and an isobutoxy group, then reduction could lead to the formation of a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but how does the reduction lead to the ring formation? Let me think about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps when the β-keto ester is reduced with a hydride agent, the enolate is formed, and then cyclization occurs to form the ring.

Wait, another thought: the starting material could be a β-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Then, upon treatment with a reducing agent, it could form an alcohol, and then undergo cyclization.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. When reduced, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and then the system cyclizes to form the pyran ring, with the ketone remaining.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester in which the ester group is an isobutoxy group. So, the structure would be something like:

RC(O)COOR', where R' is isobutoxy (OCH2CH(CH2)2?), but that's not exactly matching the options.

Wait, in the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2- ?

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps it's:

The pentanoic acid has COOH on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH with ethyl group, C4 is C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2), and C5 is another C(O)? No, that wouldn't work because the same carbon can't have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid, like 5-oxopentanoic acid with substituents on C3 and C5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH2CH(CH3)2

Wait, that would make it a β-keto ester. So the structure would be a pentanoic acid derivative where the β position (C3) has an ethyl group, and the α position (C4) has a ketone and an ester group (from isobutoxy). Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but in the options, it's 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So C5 is the end, which is the COOH. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, so maybe I should focus on the reaction.

The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So when the starting material is treated with a reducing agent, it forms this.

Wait, so perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, like a β-keto ester. Wait, the γ position is the one that would form a five-membered ring upon cyclization, but the product here is a six-membered ring.

Wait, another approach: when a β-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent, perhaps it forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the ester is converted to an alcohol, which then forms a hemiacetal.

Wait, but how does that lead to the ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. For example, let's say the structure is:

R-CO-CO-O-R'

When reduced, the β-keto ester (RCO-COOR') becomes R-CH(OH)-CH2-O-R'? No, wait, LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the β-keto ester would become R-CH2-CO-O-R'? No, wait, the reduction would be:

RCO-COOR' → RCH2-CH2-O-R' ?

Wait, maybe it's more about the formation of a secondary alcohol. Let me think. If the starting material is a β-keto ester, RCO-COOR', treatment with LiBH4 would reduce the ketone group (the RCO-) to an alcohol. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent; it would typically reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols.

Wait, so let me consider the starting material as a β-keto ester, where the ketone is at C5, and there's an ester group as well.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-C(O-O-R)-CH2-CH2- (but I'm not exactly sure).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone. So when the starting material is reduced, it must form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which then can undergo cyclization to form a ring.

Wait, let me think about the product. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, the ring has six atoms, with the ketone at position 2. So, the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C, with a ketone on the second carbon.

So perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the keto group becomes an alcohol as well, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but how. Let me think of the reaction steps.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester, say:

RCO-COOR'

When treated with LiBH4, the ketone (RCO-) would be reduced to RCH2-OH. Wait, no, LiBH4 reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So RCO → RCH2OH? No, wait, wait. Wait, RCO-R' → RCH2-OH-R' ?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2- ?

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the stereochemistry aspect.

The product has either R or S configuration. The question is about how the starting material's configuration (R or S) leads to the product's configuration upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3.

Wait, but wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. How do they affect the product's stereochemistry?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically doesn't provide any specific stereochemistry in the product when reducing a planar sp² center to sp³. So if the starting material is a prochiral ketone, the reduction with LiBH4 would lead to a racemic mixture. But the product here is a single enantiomer (R or S), so perhaps the starting material is chiral and the reduction preserves the configuration.

Wait, no, wait. LiBH4 is used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. If the ketone is part of a chiral center, then the reduction would proceed with some stereochemical control?

Wait, perhaps if the starting material has a certain configuration, the reduction would lead to a specific configuration in the product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is not of a ketone but of an ester group. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters as well, typically to the corresponding alcohols. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the ester is reduced to form an alcohol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a β-keto ester. When treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone is reduced to an alcohol as well. But that would give a diol, not a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ring opens, but that doesn't fit the product.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

The products are (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the configuration at a certain stereocenter is R or S. The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is either R or S.

So the starting material is a chiral compound with a stereogenic center at C3 (since it's 3-ethyl) and possibly another at C5 (since it's 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy). Wait, but can a carbon have both an oxo group (C=O) and an isobutoxy group? That would imply a structure like:

CH2-C(O-O-R)-COOH and an ethyl group on C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-R)-?

Wait, that would imply a structure where C4 has the C(O-O-R) group and C5 has COOH. So the starting material is a β-keto acid, perhaps.

Wait, but if the starting material is a β-keto acid, then upon reduction, the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so the reduction must not have reduced the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. Let me think about the reaction.

β-Keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, when treated with a strong reducing agent, the ester group could be reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone could be reduced as well. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that only one ketone is present, so maybe the other group is reduced.

Wait, perhaps the ester group is reduced to a hydroxyl group, and then the system cyclizes to form the ring, with the ketone remaining.

Wait, let me think of the starting material as:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R

So when LiBH4 reduces the ester group (COOR), it becomes CH2(OH)-. Then, perhaps the molecule can cyclize to form a ring.

Wait, but how would that lead to the cyclic ketone product?

Alternatively, the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then forms the ring by losing water, leading to the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which forms from a diol and a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced to an alcohol. Then, the two adjacent alcohols could lose water to form a double bond, but that doesn't form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the process is more about the formation of a cyclic ether upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible stereochemistry of the product based on the starting material's configuration.

Since the product's configuration depends on the starting material and the reducing agent, perhaps A and B have different configurations, leading to R and S products when reduced by different agents.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. When it reduces a ketone to a secondary alcohol, the stereochemistry is determined by the mechanism. If the ketone is prochiral, the reduction by LiBH4 can lead to a specific configuration, perhaps because of the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but in the case of cyclic ketones, the structure may lead to a specific stereochemistry upon reduction. But in this problem, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and when reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the system cyclizes, forming the ring and retaining the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the ester is adjacent to the ketone. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-R)-CH2-

Wait, perhaps when the ester group (O-R) is reduced to an alcohol, the molecule can form a ring by connecting the OH group to the ketone's carbon.

Wait, for example: imagine the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R

Upon reduction of the ester group (COOR) to a CH2OH group, the structure becomes:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-OH

Then, this could cyclize by forming a ring between the OH and the ketone, releasing water and forming a five-membered ring. Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reduction doesn't reduce the ester but something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring. The ethyl group is at position 4. So, when the starting material is reduced, it cyclizes to form this ring.

Assuming that the starting material has groups that can form a ring upon reduction, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Now, looking at the options, A and B are either both R, both S, or a mix of R and S.

The products are (R) and (S), so the starting materials must have opposite configurations to produce opposite configurations in the product when reduced.

Wait, but how do the reducing agents affect the configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically doesn't provide any specific stereochemistry. But in this case, perhaps the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration when reduced.

Wait, maybe the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration via a specific reduction mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a new stereocenter, and the configuration of that center depends on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester with a stereocenter at C3 (the ethyl group) and another at C5 (the isobutoxy and oxo groups). But wait, can a carbon have both an oxo group and an isobutoxy group? That would require the structure to have a carbon with O-CO-O-R, which isn't possible. So perhaps the oxo group is on C5, and the isobutoxy is on C5 as well. But that can't happen since a carbon can't have two carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry without getting too bogged down in the exact structure.

The product is either R or S, depending on which reducing agent is used on which starting material.

Assuming that the starting material is chiral, then the configuration could influence the configuration of the product.

If the starting material is (R), and upon reduction, the product's configuration depends on the direction of the hydride attack.

Wait, but when a ketone is reduced, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to racemization unless there's some steric control.

Wait, but in this case, the product isn't a racemic mixture; it's a single enantiomer. So perhaps the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde, but that doesn't fit the given options.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple ketone reduction but involves a more complex mechanism, like a conjugate reduction.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reducing agent reduces the ester group to an alcohol. The β-keto ester structure would be something like:

RCO-COOR'

Upon reduction of the ester group, it becomes RCO-CH2-OH.

Then, perhaps the molecule can undergo an intramolecular aldol condensation to form the cyclic structure.

Wait, in that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration in the product.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a hemiacetal formation after the reduction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S). If A, when reduced with LiBH4, gives R, and B, when reduced with BH3, gives S, then perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

Wait, another angle: the reducing agents might affect the stereochemistry of the product. For example, BH3 might induce a certain configuration, while LiBH4 another.

Wait, but I don't recall any specific stereochemical outcomes from using LiBH4 versus BH3 in reductions. LiBH4 is typically used for reductions of carbonyl groups to alcohols without any specific stereochemistry, as the carbonyl is planar.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to ring opening, but that doesn't fit the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reducing agent reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Assuming that the starting material is a β-keto ester with a certain configuration, the reduction would form an alcohol, and the configuration of that alcohol would impact the final product's configuration.

Now, the product is a cyclic ketone, so the ketone must remain after the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction converts the ester to an alcohol, which then can form a ring with the ketone, leading to the cyclic product.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material's stereocenter would influence the configuration of the product.

So, if the starting material is (R), the product would form an (R) configuration, and if it's (S), the product would be (S), depending on the reduction.

But how does the reducing agent affect this?

Wait, perhaps the reducing agent affects the way the ring forms. For example, LiBH4 might cause the ring to form in a way that leads to R configuration, while BH3 leads to S.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the product's configuration regardless of the reducing agent.

Wait, but in the question, A is treated with LiBH4, while B is treated with BH3. The products are R and S respectively.

So perhaps the same starting material with different configurations, when reduced with different agents, leads to different product configurations.

But the options show that A and B are the same molecule but with different configurations. So perhaps when you reduce (R) starting material with LiBH4, you get R product, and (S) starting material with BH3, you get S product.

Wait, but why would the same starting material (same configuration) reduce to R with LiBH4 and S with BH3? That doesn't make sense because the configuration would be the same regardless of the reducing agent.

Hmm, perhaps the starting materials A and B are different enantiomers, and the different reducing agents cause them to form different products in terms of configuration.

Wait, but the product's configuration is tied to the starting material's configuration, not the reducing agent's.

So, perhaps if the starting material is R, and it's reduced with either reducing agent, the product is R. But in the question, A (R) is reduced with LiBH4 to give R, and B (S) is reduced with BH3 to give S. So that would mean that the configuration of the starting material dictates the product's configuration.

But looking at the options, the options are either A and B are same or different.

Option D says A is R and B is S.

So if A is R and treated with LiBH4 to give R product, and B is S and treated with BH3 to give S product, then option D would be correct.

But how does the configuration of the starting material translate to the product's configuration?

Perhaps the reduction doesn't change the configuration but creates a new stereocenter that's influenced by the starting material's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a stereocenter that is retained in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a stereocenter at C3 (the ethyl group), which is preserved in the product, determining the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is R, the product is R, and if it's S, the product is S.

In that case, the options would require that A is R and B is S, leading to the product R and S respectively.

So the correct option would be D, where A is R and B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the proper starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for A and BH3 for B. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can exist as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. This suggests that the starting material undergoes a reduction and cyclization to form the cyclic product.

2. **Starting Material**: The starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is a β-keto ester. It has a chiral center at C3 (due to the ethyl group) and a functional group at C5 (a ketone and an isobutoxy group). The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S) will influence the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Reduction and Cyclization**: When the β-keto ester is reduced, the ester group is converted to an alcohol, which can then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone product. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

4. **Effect of Reducing Agents**: While LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents, the stereochemistry of the product is ultimately dictated by the configuration of the starting material. This is because the reduction and cyclization process preserves the relative configuration of the starting material.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the given products (R and S).
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). This would result in both products being (R), which also contradicts the given products (R and S).
   - **Option C**: A is (S) and B is (R). This would result in the products being (S) and (R), respectively, which matches the given products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R) and B is (S). This would result in the products being (R) and (S), respectively, which also matches the given products.

6. **Correct Option**: Both options C and D produce the correct products. However, the question specifies that A is treated with LiBH4 and B with BH3. Since the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material, the correct assignment is A = (R) and B = (S), as indicated in option D.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using different reducing agents on two unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, the products are (R) and (S) respectively. So A reacts with LiBH4 and H+ to give R, and B reacts with BH3 and H+ to give S. Hmm, or wait, let me check the question again.

Wait no, the question states:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So A with LiBH4 gives R product, and B with BH3 gives S product. So I need to figure out what A and B are.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different stereo configurations for compounds A and B.

The options for A and B are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with either S or R configuration.

Wait, let me think about the reactions here. The products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. That structure sounds like a cyclic ketone, perhaps a lactone or something similar. Let me visualize it: 4-ethyl, so the substituents are on the 4 position. So the ring is a six-membered ring, I think, with the ketone at position 2. So the structure is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar?

Wait, but how are these products formed from the starting materials? The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me draw that. So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, wait, pentanoic acid has five carbons, so positions 1 to 5. So position 5 is the carboxylic acid. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Wait, let me number from the COOH group as position 1, but wait, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, where the COOH is on C5, and the chain is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think of 5-oxopentanoic acid. That would have a ketone at C5. So the structure would be:

CH2(CO2H)CH2CH2CO

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid has five carbons, with the COOH on the first carbon. Wait, no, wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes the numbering is such that the functional group gets the lowest number, so the COOH is on carbon 1, and the other groups are on higher carbons.

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine it as:

The main chain is a pentanoic acid, so five carbons with COOH on C5. So positions are C1 to C5, with COOH on C5. But that doesn't make sense because pentanoic is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons including the COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's hexanoic acid. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more like:

The structure is: 

O
||
O-C-O-isobutyl group on carbon 5, which is the same as the ketone. Wait, no, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So on carbon 5, there's both an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo group). Wait, but wait, that's impossible because a ketone is a carbonyl, so the carbon can't have two substituents. Oh wait, wait, no, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, carbon 5 is the last carbon of the pentanoic acid, which is the COOH. So perhaps that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is pentanoic acid, so five carbons with COOH on C1. Then, substituents at C3 and C5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(O-CH2CH(CH2)2)-CH(CH2CH2) -CH2- ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it out.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid part is: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Another way: the pentanoic acid has five carbons. The substituents are on C3 (ethyl) and C5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Hmm. Wait, but the 5-oxo indicates a ketone on C5. But in a pentanoic acid, the COOH is on C1, so C5 would be the end. So the structure would be:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3 ethyl) - C(O-CH(CH2)2) (C4) - C(O) (C5 ketone). Wait, that doesn't make sense because C5 is the last carbon, so it can't have a COOH and a ketone. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an ether group and an ester or something that can undergo reduction. Wait, but the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring, oxygen as part of the ring, with the ketone at position 2. The substituent at position 4 is an ethyl group. So the ring has an oxygen in it, making it a tetrahydropyran derivative.

So when the starting material is treated with a reducing agent, perhaps it's undergoing a reduction that forms a ring. Wait, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation product that's being reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether that's being opened, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group, but that's not matching the given options. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester or something that can undergo cyclic hemiacetal formation upon reduction.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically used for reductions like in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, whereas LiBH4 is a general reducing agent for carbonyls.

Wait, but in the context of ketone reductions, both LiBH4 and BH3 (with a proton source) can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but how does that lead to a cyclic product?

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are causing ring-opening. Hmm, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enol ethers or something that can undergo ring-forming upon reduction. Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a β-keto ester, which can undergo a cyclization when reduced. Oh, wait, when a β-keto ester is reduced, maybe it forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Wait, let's think about the product. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So that's a five-membered ring? No, wait, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So the ring has six atoms: five carbons and one oxygen.

So, the product has a ring structure with a ketone at position 2. So, the structure is O in position 1, then carbons 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, and 6.

So, how do we get from the starting material to this product?

Perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a β-keto ester with an ethyl group and an isobutoxy group, then reduction could lead to the formation of a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but how does the reduction lead to the ring formation? Let me think about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps when the β-keto ester is reduced with a hydride agent, the enolate is formed, and then cyclization occurs to form the ring.

Wait, another thought: the starting material could be a β-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Then, upon treatment with a reducing agent, it could form an alcohol, and then undergo cyclization.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. When reduced, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and then the system cyclizes to form the pyran ring, with the ketone remaining.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester in which the ester group is an isobutoxy group. So, the structure would be something like:

RC(O)COOR', where R' is isobutoxy (OCH2CH(CH2)2?), but that's not exactly matching the options.

Wait, in the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2- ?

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps it's:

The pentanoic acid has COOH on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH with ethyl group, C4 is C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2), and C5 is another C(O)? No, that wouldn't work because the same carbon can't have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid, like 5-oxopentanoic acid with substituents on C3 and C5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH2CH(CH3)2

Wait, that would make it a β-keto ester. So the structure would be a pentanoic acid derivative where the β position (C3) has an ethyl group, and the α position (C4) has a ketone and an ester group (from isobutoxy). Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but in the options, it's 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So C5 is the end, which is the COOH. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, so maybe I should focus on the reaction.

The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So when the starting material is treated with a reducing agent, it forms this.

Wait, so perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, like a β-keto ester. Wait, the γ position is the one that would form a five-membered ring upon cyclization, but the product here is a six-membered ring.

Wait, another approach: when a β-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent, perhaps it forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the ester is converted to an alcohol, which then forms a hemiacetal.

Wait, but how does that lead to the ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. For example, let's say the structure is:

R-CO-CO-O-R'

When reduced, the β-keto ester (RCO-COOR') becomes R-CH(OH)-CH2-O-R'? No, wait, LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the β-keto ester would become R-CH2-CO-O-R'? No, wait, the reduction would be:

RCO-COOR' → RCH2-CH2-O-R' ?

Wait, maybe it's more about the formation of a secondary alcohol. Let me think. If the starting material is a β-keto ester, RCO-COOR', treatment with LiBH4 would reduce the ketone group (the RCO-) to an alcohol. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent; it would typically reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols.

Wait, so let me consider the starting material as a β-keto ester, where the ketone is at C5, and there's an ester group as well.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-C(O-O-R)-CH2-CH2- (but I'm not exactly sure).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone. So when the starting material is reduced, it must form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which then can undergo cyclization to form a ring.

Wait, let me think about the product. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, the ring has six atoms, with the ketone at position 2. So, the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C, with a ketone on the second carbon.

So perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the keto group becomes an alcohol as well, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but how. Let me think of the reaction steps.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester, say:

RCO-COOR'

When treated with LiBH4, the ketone (RCO-) would be reduced to RCH2-OH. Wait, no, LiBH4 reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So RCO → RCH2OH? No, wait, wait. Wait, RCO-R' → RCH2-OH-R' ?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2- ?

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the stereochemistry aspect.

The product has either R or S configuration. The question is about how the starting material's configuration (R or S) leads to the product's configuration upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3.

Wait, but wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. How do they affect the product's stereochemistry?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically doesn't provide any specific stereochemistry in the product when reducing a planar sp² center to sp³. So if the starting material is a prochiral ketone, the reduction with LiBH4 would lead to a racemic mixture. But the product here is a single enantiomer (R or S), so perhaps the starting material is chiral and the reduction preserves the configuration.

Wait, no, wait. LiBH4 is used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. If the ketone is part of a chiral center, then the reduction would proceed with some stereochemical control?

Wait, perhaps if the starting material has a certain configuration, the reduction would lead to a specific configuration in the product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is not of a ketone but of an ester group. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters as well, typically to the corresponding alcohols. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the ester is reduced to form an alcohol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a β-keto ester. When treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone is reduced to an alcohol as well. But that would give a diol, not a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ring opens, but that doesn't fit the product.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

The products are (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the configuration at a certain stereocenter is R or S. The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is either R or S.

So the starting material is a chiral compound with a stereogenic center at C3 (since it's 3-ethyl) and possibly another at C5 (since it's 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy). Wait, but can a carbon have both an oxo group (C=O) and an isobutoxy group? That would imply a structure like:

CH2-C(O-O-R)-COOH and an ethyl group on C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-R)-?

Wait, that would imply a structure where C4 has the C(O-O-R) group and C5 has COOH. So the starting material is a β-keto acid, perhaps.

Wait, but if the starting material is a β-keto acid, then upon reduction, the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so the reduction must not have reduced the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. Let me think about the reaction.

β-Keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, when treated with a strong reducing agent, the ester group could be reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone could be reduced as well. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that only one ketone is present, so maybe the other group is reduced.

Wait, perhaps the ester group is reduced to a hydroxyl group, and then the system cyclizes to form the ring, with the ketone remaining.

Wait, let me think of the starting material as:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R

So when LiBH4 reduces the ester group (COOR), it becomes CH2(OH)-. Then, perhaps the molecule can cyclize to form a ring.

Wait, but how would that lead to the cyclic ketone product?

Alternatively, the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then forms the ring by losing water, leading to the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which forms from a diol and a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced to an alcohol. Then, the two adjacent alcohols could lose water to form a double bond, but that doesn't form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the process is more about the formation of a cyclic ether upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible stereochemistry of the product based on the starting material's configuration.

Since the product's configuration depends on the starting material and the reducing agent, perhaps A and B have different configurations, leading to R and S products when reduced by different agents.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. When it reduces a ketone to a secondary alcohol, the stereochemistry is determined by the mechanism. If the ketone is prochiral, the reduction by LiBH4 can lead to a specific configuration, perhaps because of the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but in the case of cyclic ketones, the structure may lead to a specific stereochemistry upon reduction. But in this problem, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and when reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the system cyclizes, forming the ring and retaining the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the ester is adjacent to the ketone. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-R)-CH2-

Wait, perhaps when the ester group (O-R) is reduced to an alcohol, the molecule can form a ring by connecting the OH group to the ketone's carbon.

Wait, for example: imagine the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R

Upon reduction of the ester group (COOR) to a CH2OH group, the structure becomes:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-OH

Then, this could cyclize by forming a ring between the OH and the ketone, releasing water and forming a five-membered ring. Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reduction doesn't reduce the ester but something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring. The ethyl group is at position 4. So, when the starting material is reduced, it cyclizes to form this ring.

Assuming that the starting material has groups that can form a ring upon reduction, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Now, looking at the options, A and B are either both R, both S, or a mix of R and S.

The products are (R) and (S), so the starting materials must have opposite configurations to produce opposite configurations in the product when reduced.

Wait, but how do the reducing agents affect the configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically doesn't provide any specific stereochemistry. But in this case, perhaps the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration when reduced.

Wait, maybe the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration via a specific reduction mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a new stereocenter, and the configuration of that center depends on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester with a stereocenter at C3 (the ethyl group) and another at C5 (the isobutoxy and oxo groups). But wait, can a carbon have both an oxo group and an isobutoxy group? That would require the structure to have a carbon with O-CO-O-R, which isn't possible. So perhaps the oxo group is on C5, and the isobutoxy is on C5 as well. But that can't happen since a carbon can't have two carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry without getting too bogged down in the exact structure.

The product is either R or S, depending on which reducing agent is used on which starting material.

Assuming that the starting material is chiral, then the configuration could influence the configuration of the product.

If the starting material is (R), and upon reduction, the product's configuration depends on the direction of the hydride attack.

Wait, but when a ketone is reduced, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to racemization unless there's some steric control.

Wait, but in this case, the product isn't a racemic mixture; it's a single enantiomer. So perhaps the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde, but that doesn't fit the given options.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple ketone reduction but involves a more complex mechanism, like a conjugate reduction.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reducing agent reduces the ester group to an alcohol. The β-keto ester structure would be something like:

RCO-COOR'

Upon reduction of the ester group, it becomes RCO-CH2-OH.

Then, perhaps the molecule can undergo an intramolecular aldol condensation to form the cyclic structure.

Wait, in that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration in the product.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a hemiacetal formation after the reduction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S). If A, when reduced with LiBH4, gives R, and B, when reduced with BH3, gives S, then perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

Wait, another angle: the reducing agents might affect the stereochemistry of the product. For example, BH3 might induce a certain configuration, while LiBH4 another.

Wait, but I don't recall any specific stereochemical outcomes from using LiBH4 versus BH3 in reductions. LiBH4 is typically used for reductions of carbonyl groups to alcohols without any specific stereochemistry, as the carbonyl is planar.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to ring opening, but that doesn't fit the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reducing agent reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Assuming that the starting material is a β-keto ester with a certain configuration, the reduction would form an alcohol, and the configuration of that alcohol would impact the final product's configuration.

Now, the product is a cyclic ketone, so the ketone must remain after the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction converts the ester to an alcohol, which then can form a ring with the ketone, leading to the cyclic product.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material's stereocenter would influence the configuration of the product.

So, if the starting material is (R), the product would form an (R) configuration, and if it's (S), the product would be (S), depending on the reduction.

But how does the reducing agent affect this?

Wait, perhaps the reducing agent affects the way the ring forms. For example, LiBH4 might cause the ring to form in a way that leads to R configuration, while BH3 leads to S.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the product's configuration regardless of the reducing agent.

Wait, but in the question, A is treated with LiBH4, while B is treated with BH3. The products are R and S respectively.

So perhaps the same starting material with different configurations, when reduced with different agents, leads to different product configurations.

But the options show that A and B are the same molecule but with different configurations. So perhaps when you reduce (R) starting material with LiBH4, you get R product, and (S) starting material with BH3, you get S product.

Wait, but why would the same starting material (same configuration) reduce to R with LiBH4 and S with BH3? That doesn't make sense because the configuration would be the same regardless of the reducing agent.

Hmm, perhaps the starting materials A and B are different enantiomers, and the different reducing agents cause them to form different products in terms of configuration.

Wait, but the product's configuration is tied to the starting material's configuration, not the reducing agent's.

So, perhaps if the starting material is R, and it's reduced with either reducing agent, the product is R. But in the question, A (R) is reduced with LiBH4 to give R, and B (S) is reduced with BH3 to give S. So that would mean that the configuration of the starting material dictates the product's configuration.

But looking at the options, the options are either A and B are same or different.

Option D says A is R and B is S.

So if A is R and treated with LiBH4 to give R product, and B is S and treated with BH3 to give S product, then option D would be correct.

But how does the configuration of the starting material translate to the product's configuration?

Perhaps the reduction doesn't change the configuration but creates a new stereocenter that's influenced by the starting material's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a stereocenter that is retained in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a stereocenter at C3 (the ethyl group), which is preserved in the product, determining the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is R, the product is R, and if it's S, the product is S.

In that case, the options would require that A is R and B is S, leading to the product R and S respectively.

So the correct option would be D, where A is R and B is S.


The question involves determining the proper starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for A and BH3 for B. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can exist as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. This suggests that the starting material undergoes a reduction and cyclization to form the cyclic product.

2. **Starting Material**: The starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is a β-keto ester. It has a chiral center at C3 (due to the ethyl group) and a functional group at C5 (a ketone and an isobutoxy group). The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S) will influence the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Reduction and Cyclization**: When the β-keto ester is reduced, the ester group is converted to an alcohol, which can then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone product. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

4. **Effect of Reducing Agents**: While LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents, the stereochemistry of the product is ultimately dictated by the configuration of the starting material. This is because the reduction and cyclization process preserves the relative configuration of the starting material.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the given products (R and S).
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). This would result in both products being (R), which also contradicts the given products (R and S).
   - **Option C**: A is (S) and B is (R). This would result in the products being (S) and (R), respectively, which matches the given products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R) and B is (S). This would result in the products being (R) and (S), respectively, which also matches the given products.

6. **Correct Option**: Both options C and D produce the correct products. However, the question specifies that A is treated with LiBH4 and B with BH3. Since the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material, the correct assignment is A = (R) and B = (S), as indicated in option D.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

**Answer: D**
