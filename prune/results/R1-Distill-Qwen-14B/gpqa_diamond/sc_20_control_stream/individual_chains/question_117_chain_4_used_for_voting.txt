Okay, so I have this chemistry question about optical isomerism in different organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism happens when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms with four different substituents. Let me think about each of these compounds one by one.

The question lists four compounds, 1 to 4. The options are combinations of which ones show optical isomerism. Let me go through each.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So the structure is two phenyl groups connected, with substituents at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but the substituents are nitro groups and methyl esters. Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 on each ring. So the molecule is symmetrical? If the substituents are at positions 2 on each phenyl ring, then maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Or maybe the nitro groups are in positions that create symmetry. If there's a plane of symmetry, then no chiral centers. Or wait, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that there are chiral centers elsewhere.

Wait, wait, the structure is a biphenyl with substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro at 6 on each ring, and the carboxylate esters at 2 on each. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Let me visualize: each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a COOCH3 group at position 2. Since the rings are connected in a biphenyl structure, which is a single bond, can they rotate and create a plane of symmetry?

Wait, but if both rings have identical substituents in symmetrical positions, then the whole molecule might be symmetrical. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. Or maybe, the substituents are arranged such that each ring has the same groups, making the whole molecule not have any chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a way that each ring's substituents don't make the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are the same, like each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, then perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. So maybe the molecule is achiral. Wait, but sometimes, even if the substituents are the same, the way they're arranged could lead to a chiral center elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps the central carbon isn't a carbon but a single bond between two benzene rings. So the substituents are on the benzene rings, not a central carbon. So maybe there's no chiral center here, meaning it doesn't show optical isomerism. I'm a bit confused, but I'll come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH. Wait, no. Let me write it properly. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon of the propanoate. So it's O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2COHCOOCH3. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; so methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the second carbon. So the structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is on the third carbon; the second carbon has an OH and a CH3 group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Then the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: 

    O
    ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH2-OH

Wait, no. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is on the first carbon. The second carbon has an OH group. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (second) has two CH2 groups attached? Wait, no. Let me count: the first carbon is the COOCH3, the second is CH2OH, and the third is another CH2? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons, so the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

R-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, maybe it's:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The ester is between the carboxylic acid and methanol. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (second) has two CH2 groups? No, wait. Let me imagine the molecule: the chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that's three carbons. So the structure is:

CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- One CH3,

- One OH,

- One COOCH3,

and another CH group (the one on the left is CH3, right is CH2? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the carbon chain is: the COOCH3 is on the third carbon, the middle is CH2OH, and the first is CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second) is CH2. So, the substituents on the second carbon are:

- One CH2OH,

- One CH2COOCH3,

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain: CH2(OH) is first, CH2 is second, COOCH3 is third. So the second carbon is CH2. So that carbon is connected to two CH2 groups and two others? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2COOCH3, but with an OH on the second carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is.

The key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center requires four different substituents. So in compound 2, is the middle (second) carbon a chiral center?

Looking at the structure:

CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3.

Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain. So the second carbon has:

- One CH3,

- One OH,

- One COOCH3,

and the fourth substituent is a hydrogen? Because in a three-carbon chain, the middle carbon is CH. So, is it CH2? Wait, no: the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3–,

Carbon 2: CH(OH)–,

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, in that case, Carbon 2 would have:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and a hydrogen.

So substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four substituents are different. So that would be a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. That's a diketone, with two benzene rings attached to a ketone. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the ketone group). Wait, no. The structure is more accurately:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. The substituents are two phenyl groups, one O (from the carbonyl), and another O (double bonded, but that's not considered as a substituent in this case). Wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an O, so its substituents are two phenyl groups and two oxygens (but one is a double bond). Wait, no, substituents are what's attached via a single bond. So for the carbonyl carbon, the substituents are two phenyl groups and two oxygens (one from the ketone oxygen, but that's a double bond, so the substituents are the two phenyls and one O). Wait, no, in reality, the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is double-bonded to O, so it's sp² hybridized. So it can't be a chiral center because it's trigonal planar. So even if there are substituents, it's not a tetrahedral center, so no chirality. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure is CH2–CH– where each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H, but in the trans configuration. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the double bond between the two middle carbons in the trans configuration. No, wait, more accurately, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two middle carbons.

So dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)–CH(COOCH3). Wait, no. Let me think: Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, so each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, the actual structure is CH2=CH–(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH2–CH(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond. Wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has two substituents.

Wait, more accurately, the molecule is (E)-CH2–CH(COOCH3)–CH(COOCH3)–CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2–CH2– with the ester groups. No, perhaps I should think of it as:

The fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which has the formula HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is MeO-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-Me? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So in the diester, each HOOC becomes OMe. So structure is OMeOC-CH=CH-CO-OMe. So the four substituents on the double bond are two OMe groups (on one side) and two H's (on the other side?), no. Wait, no: in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on the same side? Wait, in the (E) configuration, the substituents are opposite.

Wait, the (E) configuration of fumaric acid is where the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would have two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, it's:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but with a double bond. No, no. Let me think again. The di-ester of fumaric acid (which is (E)-butenedioic acid) would be:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, because each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, in fumaric acid, the structure is HOOC–CH2–CH2–COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the correct structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH but with a double bond. No, wait, that's not correct. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH but with a double bond between the central carbons. So the correct structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but the two CH₂ groups are connected by a double bond, making it HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → that's actually not correct, because that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, the correct structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond, so it's HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H? No, but that would be succinic acid if it's a single bond. Wait, no, but fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → no, that’s not correct because that’s a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's HOOC–CH=CH–COOH. Yes, that makes sense. So in this structure, the two COOH groups are on either end of the double bond.

Then, the dimethyl ester would replace the two OH groups in the COOH with OCH3.

So the structure is OMeO-C-CH₂-CH₂-C-O-OMe. No, no. Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, because the fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂, which would be HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH but with a double bond, making it HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → no, perhaps I'm not getting it right.

Wait, but the main point is whether dimethyl fumarate has geometric isomerism or not. Because in this case, the substituents are such that the molecule can have E and Z isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the presence of a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, so if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates cis or trans isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center. Does dimethyl fumarate have any? Let me think about its structure.

The structure is MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–Me? No, that would be succinate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dioic acid. So the structure is MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–Me but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–Me with a double bond? No, wait, no, fumaric acid has the two COOH groups on either end of a double bond. So the structure is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, so the ester would be OMeOC–CH=CH–COO–OMe.

So each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So each CH has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a CH. Wait, no, each CH is part of the double bond. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are:

For the left CH: two COOCH3 groups and two CH₂ groups? No. Wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, each CH is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH (from the double bond).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled, but perhaps the key point is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents that can lead to E and Z isomerism. But that's not optical isomerism; that's geometric (cis-trans) isomerism. Optical isomerism is about chiral centers, which require a carbon with four different substituents.

So in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? Let's see: the carbons adjacent to the double bond would be CH₂ groups, but if the double bond is in the middle, perhaps the central carbons are part of the double bond and are sp² hybridized. So they cannot be chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Or is there another possibility?

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. The two CH groups are in the double bond, so each has two substituents (COOCH3 and another CH). Wait, but each of those CH groups isn't a carbon with four different substituents because each is connected via a double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe it does because of the substituents, but perhaps not.

Wait, no, another thought: the ester groups are on both ends. If the substituents on the double bond are the same, then there's no possibility of E or Z isomerism. Wait, no, because each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, in dimethyl fumarate, both substituents on each carbon of the double bond are COOCH3. So the structure is symmetric, meaning that E and Z isomerism isn't possible because the substituents are the same on both sides. So dimethyl fumarate actually doesn't have geometric isomerism either. But wait, that can't be right because fumarate is known to have geometric isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are different. Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group. Wait, no, if the structure is OMeOC-CH2-CH2-COO-OMe with a double bond in the middle, perhaps it's OMeOC-CH₂-CH₂-COO-OMe, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So each CH in the double bond is connected to a CH₂ group and a COOCH3 group. Wait, that would mean that each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and two CH₂ groups. So the substituents on each carbon are CH₂, CH₂, and COOCH3. So each carbon in the double bond would have two identical substituents (the two CH₂ groups), meaning that the molecule would be symmetric, and thus cannot have E or Z isomerism. That can't be right, though, because I know that fumarate has E and Z isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH. So when it's converted to dimethyl ester, it becomes OMeO–C–CH=CH–CO–O–OMe. So each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is OMeOC–CH=CH–COO–OMe. So each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, no, because the CH is connected to the COOCH3 and the other CH. So each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, but also the double bond.

Wait, in that case, the substituents on each CH are: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups in the double bond. So the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

- One COOCH3,

- One H,

- Two CH (from the double bond).

Wait, but each CH in the double bond is connected to the next CH, so the substituents are two CH groups and a COOCH3 and H. So each CH has four substituents: COOCH3, H, CH (from the double bond), and another CH (from the double bond). Wait, that can't be right, because each CH in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons, which are each part of the double bond. So the substituents are two CH groups, and the other two are COOCH3 and H. Wait, no, each CH in the double bond has two substituents: one COOCH3, one H, and two CH groups (but those are actually part of the same double bond, so perhaps they're not considered substituents in that context).

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. The key point is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two identical substituents (COOCH3 groups) on each end. So the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So perhaps each carbon has COOCH3, H, and two CH groups. Wait, but that would mean that the substituents are COOCH3, H, and two CH groups. So each carbon in the double bond has:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- CH,

- another CH (which is part of the same double bond).

In that case, the two substituents are COOCH3 and H, and the other two are CH groups. So each carbon has the same two substituents (COOCH3 and H) and two CH groups. So this would result in the possibility of E and Z isomerism. 

Wait, but if the substituents on each carbon are COOCH3 and H, then the molecule can have geometric isomerism. So E and Z isomerism exists because the arrangement of the substituents around the double bond can be different. But this is geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers; its isomerism is geometric. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, back to the original question. Which of the four compounds show optical isomerism?

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

We need to determine if this has a chiral center. The structure is a biphenyl with substituents on each ring. Let me imagine:

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The two rings are connected by a single bond. So, the substituents on each ring are at the 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has two substituents in meta positions.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are identical, then the molecule would be symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group in the same positions relative to the central bond, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. If that's the case, the molecule wouldn't have any chiral centers and hence no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that lead to a chiral arrangement. Wait, but each ring is attached to the other via a single bond. So, maybe the substituents are arranged such that each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group, but the overall molecule is symmetrical. So, perhaps it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for free rotation, which would make the molecule symmetrical, thus not chiral. So, I think this compound doesn't have any chiral centers and doesn't show optical isomerism.

But wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are such that when viewed from the central bond, they are not mirror images. Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that lead to a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, but the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are flat. So, maybe the central bond allows rotation, which would make any asymmetry disappear upon rotation, making the molecule achiral. So, perhaps compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, summarizing:

1. No optical isomerism (no chiral center).

2. Yes, has a chiral center, so shows optical isomerism.

3. No, no chiral centers.

4. No, no chiral centers, only geometric isomerism.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 and 4? Wait, earlier I thought 4 doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, no, I thought 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 1,2,4; but I thought 1 and 4 don't. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Wait, wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester with two COOCH3 groups on each end of a double bond. So the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond in the middle. So, the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe but with a double bond. No, wait, the correct structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe → no, that's succinate. For fumarate, the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, but in that case, each CH₂ is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe, but with a double bond between the two CH₂. So, it's OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond between the two CH₂. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to a CH₂ group and a COOCH3 group. So each CH has two substituents: a CH₂ and a COOCH3. So, each CH has two identical substituents (if each has a CH₂ and a COOCH3). So, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

- One COOCH3,

- One CH₂,

and two H's (since the CH is double bonded, perhaps each has a H? No, double bonds are sp² hybridized, with each CH having one H).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH₂=CH–COO–OCH3.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure would be OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe → but with a double bond, it becomes OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe → which isn't correct. Alternatively, I'm making a mistake in the structure. 

Perhaps the correct structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H. So each CH has:

- One COOCH3,

- One H,

and two CH groups (as part of the double bond). So each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and two CH groups (but those are part of the same double bond).

In this case, the molecule would have the possibility of E and Z isomerism, which is geometric, not optical. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism. So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but let's reevaluate compound 1. Could it have a chiral center elsewhere? If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere, perhaps at the central bond. Wait, the biphenyl is connected by a single bond, which can rotate. So, if the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, perhaps it's chiral. For example, if on each ring, the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical.

Wait, in compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So, when looking at the biphenyl, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. The position 2 on one ring is adjacent to the position 6 on the same ring. Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center at the central bond. But the central bond is a single bond between two benzene rings, which are flat. So, the central bond doesn't have a chiral center; it's just a single bond.

Wait, but if the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically relative to the central bond, perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such positions that they can't be superimposed by rotation or reflection. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of the substituents on the two rings.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Another approach is to think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are mirror images of each other across the central bond, then the molecule would be symmetrical and thus not chiral.

But in this case, the substituents on each ring are nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, perhaps the overall molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents in symmetrical positions relative to the central bond. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, based on that, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is compound 2.

But looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → No, because I think only 2 is correct.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No, 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → No, 1 I think doesn't.

Wait, but wait a minute. Looking back, I might have made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate's structure: does it have any chiral centers? 

If the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, then each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH₂ group. So, each CH has substituents: COOCH3, CH₂, and two H's (from the double bond). Wait, each CH in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and CH₂. But in that case, each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3 and CH₂), so it's not a chiral center. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me search my memory: fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Does it have a chiral center? No, because it's a double bond. So, no optical isomerism, only geometric. Thus, no.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → Three compounds, but according to me, only 2.

B) 3 and4 → No.

C) 2 and3 → No, 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and2 → 1 doesn't.

Hmm, none of the options directly say only 2. Wait, looking back, the options are:

Option A: 1,2,4

Option B: 3 and4

Option C: 2 and3

Option D:1 and2

Wait, that's not matching. So, maybe I made a mistake in my assessment.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Another approach: think about each compound and whether they have any stereogenic centers.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Are there any chiral centers? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, no. If not, then yes.

But if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond, the molecule would be symmetrical. So perhaps it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: as discussed, has a chiral center. So yes.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers.

Thus, only 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options list only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → So, 3 in total.

B) 3 and4 → No.

C) 2 and3 → No.

D)1 and2 → No.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the structure is OMeOC–CH=CH–COO–OMe. Each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a H. So, substituents on each CH are COOCH3, H, and two CH (from the double bond). But in such a case, each CH is connected to two substituents (COOCH3 and H), and two CH groups. So, each CH has the same substituents, so no chiral center. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → So includes 1 and 4; perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound4. Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. So, only 2.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I don't see why 1 and 4 would show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound1. Let me think again. Could compound1 have a chiral center?

In compound1: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Suppose the substituents are arranged in such a way that their positions relative to the central bond create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center at the point where the two rings are connected. But the connection is a single bond between two benzene rings; such a bond isn't a carbon atom, so it can't be a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a chiral arrangement in space. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such positions that they cannot be superimposed, leading to a chiral molecule.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Another approach is to think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, it's achiral; otherwise, it's chiral.

In compound1, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Since the rings are connected at position 1, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are meta to the connecting point. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

So, I think only compound2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a H. So each CH has substituents COOCH3, H, and the two CH groups. So, substituents are COOCH3, H, and two CH. So, each CH has two identical substituents (the CH groups), meaning no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have an option with only 2. But looking at the options again:

Option A) 1,2,4 → 3 compounds.

Option B) 3 and4 → 2.

Option C) 2 and3 → 2.

Option D) 1 and2 → 2.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake. Let me reevaluate each compound once more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond, but each CH in the double bond is connected to a CH3 group. No, that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH with the trans configuration. So, when esterified, it becomes OMeOC–CH=CH–COO–OMe. Each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So, each CH has substituents: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups.

Wait, but in that case, each CH has substituents COOCH3 and H, and the other two substituents are CH groups. So, each CH has two substituents: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups. Wait, that would mean each CH is bonded to four substituents, but two of them are the same (the CH groups). So, each CH is bonded to COOCH3, H, and two CH groups (which are identical), so they're not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center exists, so no optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound2 has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I'm wrong, and one of the other compounds does have a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again about compound4: dimethyl fumarate. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, the ester groups are on a central carbon. No, that's not the case. The ester groups are on the ends of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a different structure. Wait, perhaps the structure is OMeOC–CH2–CH2–COO–OMe, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, each CH2 is part of the double bond. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3 group. No, that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake and compound4 also has a chiral center.

Wait, another angle: perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are such that each CH has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, making the substituents on each CH different. Wait, each CH in the double bond would have:

- One COOCH3,

- One CH2,

and two H's from the double bond.

Wait, but then each CH has substituents COOCH3, CH2, and two H's. So, four substituents: COOCH3, CH2, H, H. No, that's three substituents, but the fourth is the double bond. Wait, no, each CH in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and CH2. But each has two H's attached as part of the double bond. So, each CH has substituents COOCH3, CH2, H, H. But that would mean two substituents are the same (H), so it's not a chiral center.

Thus, I think I'm confident that only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound1. Let me think again: could compound1 have a chiral center?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are at positions that make the arrangement asymmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions that lead to a chiral center at the central bond. But the central bond is between two benzene rings; it's a single bond and doesn't have a chiral center.

So I think compound1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound4. Let me think again: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that each end of the double bond has different substituents, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, no. The structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe, but with a double bond. So, each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group. So, each CH has substituents COOCH3, CH₂, and two H's (from the double bond). So, the substituents are COOCH3, CH₂, and two H's. Thus, each CH has two substituents that are the same (H), so no chiral center.

Thus, I'm confident that only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of compound4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a different structure. Let me think: another possibility is that the structure is such that the ester groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but with a double bond, making it COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 → no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond in the middle. So, the structure would be OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe → but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, each CH in the double bond has substituents: COOCH3, CH₂, and two H's. So, no chiral center.

Thus, I think I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis. Perhaps only compound2 is correct, but the options don't reflect that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound4. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center in the ester groups. No, the ester groups are on the ends, each is a COOCH3 group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about geometric isomerism being considered as optical isomerism, but that's incorrect. Geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism.

Hmm. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's list each compound's possibility:

1. If the molecule is symmetrical, no optical isomerism. If not, yes.

2. Has a chiral center → yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Thus, only 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option C (2,3) and option D (1,2). But according to me, only 2 is correct.

But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, the correct answer is option A, and I'm wrong about 1 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound1. Let me think once more.

Compound1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, if you look at the two rings, each has substituents in the same positions relative to the central bond. Thus, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, back to the conclusion: only 2 shows optical isomerism. But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, leading to a chiral center. But wait, each CH in the double bond has substituents:

- COOCH3,

- CH2,

and two H's.

So, the substituents are COOCH3, CH2, H, H. Thus, two substituents are the same (H), so no chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound2 shows optical isomerism. Since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I made a mistake about 1 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I missed something in compounds1 and4.

But I think I've exhausted my analysis. So, the only correct answer based on my reasoning is that only compound2 shows optical isomerism. However, since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, including 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound1. Let me think: perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such positions that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

If each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the two rings are connected at position 1, then perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on one ring are in different positions relative to those on the other ring, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, another way to think: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule lack a plane of symmetry. For example, if one ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the other ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, but the arrangement is such that the molecule is not symmetrical. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

In the absence of more information, I think I'll have to go with my initial conclusion: only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate compound4 once again. What if the structure is such that each CH in the double bond has different substituents, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is OMeOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO–OMe with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, then each CH has substituents:

- COOCH3,

- CH₂,

and two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, CH₂, H, H. So, not four different groups, thus no chiral center.

Therefore, I think I'm confident that only compound2 shows optical isomerism. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I don't know why.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I made a mistake in assessing compound1 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, with compounds 1, 2, and 4 showing optical isomerism.

But without more information, I can't say for sure. Based on my analysis, the correct answer should be option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound1 and 4.

In conclusion, based on my analysis, only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has at least one chiral center, defined as a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2 on each ring. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings, which creates a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This carbon is a chiral center, so the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph–C(=O)–Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar, meaning it cannot be a chiral center. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is OMeOC–CH=CH–COO–OMe. The double bond between the two CH groups prevents the formation of chiral centers. Each CH in the double bond is bonded to identical substituents (COOCH₃ and H), so no chiral centers are present. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (compound 2) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) have chiral centers and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options correctly reflect this conclusion. Based on the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **Option A (1, 2, 4)**, though there is uncertainty about the inclusion of compounds 1 and 4 in the answer.
