Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. A chemist found a white solid, and we have some spectral data to figure out what it is. Let me try to break this down.

First, the options are four different compounds. I'll need to compare their structures with the spectral data given.

Let's look at the mass spectrum first. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest point, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at 158, which is 2 m/z higher. Hmm, that might suggest the presence of a chlorine atom. Because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35, but wait, the molecular ion is 156. Let me calculate the formula weights of the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But with a Cl and another O from the hydroxyl group. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight would be (12*7)+(5*1)+(35.5)+(16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, but the mass is 156, maybe it's approximate. The M+ peak is 156, which fits.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. With a Cl, so formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A, molecular weight would be same as option A: 156.5. So that fits the M+.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as A and B. Molecular weight would be same, 156.5.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, same formula, same molecular weight.

Wait, so all options have same formula? Or did I miscalculate?

Wait, let's recheck. 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at 2. So benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but adding Cl and another O (from OH) would make it C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is 12*7=84, 5*1=5, Cl is ~35.5, O2 is 32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So M+ at 156 matches.

Same goes for B, D. So the molecular ion is 156, but the other peak is at 158, which is two more than 156. Hmm. Could that be the M+ plus something? Maybe a Cl isotope? Wait, Cl has a natural abundance of about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So the molecular ion would have two peaks: 156 and 158, with the ratio depending on Cl content.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and then a peak at 158 (32%). That suggests that the molecular ion is 156, and the 158 is either a fragment or an isotope peak.

Wait, Cl usually has a mass of 35 and 37. If the molecule has one Cl, then the molecular ion would appear as M and M+2, in a 3:1 ratio (since each Cl atom contributes 37-35=2, and with one Cl, the ratio would be 75% M and 25% M+2). But in the data, M is 100% (at 156), and M+2 is 32% (at 158). Wait, that doesn't add up because 32% is less than 25% would be if it's a single Cl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 158 peak is a fragment. But then why would the fragment be 32%? Alternatively, maybe there are two Cl atoms. Wait, but looking at the options, only one Cl each. So that might not fit.

Wait another thought: The molecular ion is at 156, and another peak at 158 (32%). So perhaps it's the molecular ion plus a fragment or an adduct. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is losing a fragment. For example, if it's losing a Cl, but that would go to lower mass. Alternatively, perhaps the 158 is a fragment with something else. Hmm.

Let me think about the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, which usually indicates O-H stretch. But wait, broad can also be N-H, but in this case, no N in the options so probably O-H.

Then, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. The position can indicate the type of carbonyl. For example, a carboxylic acid has a broad O-H and a carbonyl around 1700. An aldehyde is around 2820 and 2720 (stretching, but the carbonyl is around 1700 as well). Wait, but the strong peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher. That's more indicative of maybe an ester or a chloroformate. Or a ketone, but no ketones in the options.

Wait, let me think: the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700-1725 cm^-1, but usually a bit lower. Alternatively, an acid chloride has a higher carbonyl, around 1800. Wait, but 1720 is more like a carboxylic acid or ester.

Wait, for benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. An ester is around 1730-1750. So 1720 is in between. What about a chloroformate? The structure would be O=C(OCl)-O-Ph. The carbonyl in chloroformate is typically around 1780-1760 cm^-1. Hmm, so 1720 seems a bit low for that.

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the broad peak in IR would be from the O-H stretch. Let's see the options: options B and D are benzoic acids. Option A is an aldehyde with an OH group. Then, options B and D have a COOH group. So their IR would have a broad O-H (carboxylic) and a strong carbonyl around 1700.

Wait, but the peak at 1720 is a bit higher than typical for carboxylic acids. Could it be a conjugated carbonyl? Like if it's attached to an aromatic ring, the carbonyl might be deshielded and absorb at a higher wavenumber. Or perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, looking back at the 1H NMR data. There's a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is a strong indication of an -OH proton. But wait, in DMSO, an -OH proton would be a broad peak, but in CDCl3, it's usually a singlet but might be broad. Wait, but 11 ppm is high. For a carboxylic acid, the OH proton is around 10-12 ppm, as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet. So that makes me think that maybe the OH is a phenolic OH or an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So 11.0 is more consistent with a carboxylic acid or a phenolic OH.

Wait, but in the options, benzoic acid (B and D) would have a COOH group, which would have an OH at around 11 ppm, as a broad singlet. But the NMR here shows a singlet, which is a bit conflicting because carboxylic acid OHs are broad. But perhaps in the spectrum, it's a singlet but broad, but the description says 's' (singlet), so maybe it's not very broad, which could suggest something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, and as a singlet.

Wait, another point: the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm and a doublet at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm. The doublets are probably aromatic protons. Let's think about the coupling.

In the NMR, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps it's a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if the substituents are at the 2 and 5 positions, but that's less likely. Alternatively, if it's a meta substitution, but that would lead to more splitting or perhaps a triplet. Alternatively, maybe a para substitution with two substituents.

Wait, let's think about each option's structure.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the benzaldehyde ring has a Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2, and aldehyde at position 1. So the ring is:

Positions 1: aldehyde.

Position 2: OH.

Position 3: Cl.

So the remaining positions are 4,5,6.

Wait, but for the NMR, how would the aromatic protons look? The ring would have substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. So perhaps the structure is like 2-OH, 3-Cl, 1-formyl.

So in that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. But that may complicate the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), which would leave the ring with two doublets. Hmm, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the doublets are from substitution pattern.

Wait, let's imagine a para-substituted benzene. So if substituents are at positions 2 and 5, but that's not what any of the options are.

Wait, looking at option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. So ring positions 1 (COOH), 4 (Cl). The other positions are 2,3,5,6.

So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But in benzoic acid, the COOH is in position 1, and Cl at position 4. So the ring would have two substituents, para to each other (COOH and Cl). So the protons adjacent to Cl would be at 3 and 5 positions. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H. So maybe the ring has two doublets, meaning that the coupling is between adjacent protons. For a para-substituted ring, perhaps the protons ortho to each substituent are each a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal coupling. For instance, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, then the protons at 2 and 4 would be adjacent, leading to coupling.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this mentally. For option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Positions:

1: COOH

4: Cl.

So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

The NMR shows two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps the protons at 2 and 6 are a set, and the protons at 3 and 5 are another set. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to substituents have similar environments. So if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring would have symmetry. Let's think: substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl) – so the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent.

So for the aromatic region, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be next to COOH and Cl? Wait, no. Position 2 is adjacent to COOH (position 1) and position 3. Position 6 is adjacent to COOH (position 1) and position 5. Position 3 is adjacent to Cl (position 4) and position 2. Position 5 is adjacent to Cl (position 4) and position 6.

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons at 2 and 6 would have similar environments, and those at 3 and 5 would also be similar.

In the NMR, integration is 2H each for the two doublets. So protons at 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and protons at 3 and 5 would be another.

But wait, the coupling pattern would depend on their neighboring protons. For protons at 2 and 6: each is adjacent to a proton at 3 and 1 (but 1 is a COOH, which isn't a proton). Wait, position 1 is COOH, so no H. So the protons at 2 and 6 would each have only one adjacent H (at 3 and 5, respectively). Hmm, but that might complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between protons at 2-3 and 5-6. That would lead to each set of protons being a doublet. So the 2 and 6 would each couple with their adjacent protons (3 and 5), leading to each being a doublet.

But then the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That fits the data given: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H).

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be more deshielded and appear downfield, maybe around 8.0 ppm, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be less deshielded, maybe around 7.72 ppm.

Alternatively, are there other possibilities?

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be O=C(OCl)Ph. So the carbonyl is attached to an OCl group and a phenyl. The aromatic ring is attached to a carbonyl, so the substituent is at position 1. So the ring would have substituent at position 1, which is the chloroformate group.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be in the meta and para positions relative to the substituent. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at position 1, so the adjacent protons are at 2 and 6. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to the substituent, and protons at 4 would be para.

Wait, but in chloroformate, the substituent is a good electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent (ortho) protons and cause them to appear downfield. The para proton would be less deshielded.

In the NMR, if the substituent is at position 1, the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho, and would likely be a doublet each, but again, depending on coupling. But looking at the data, the NMR has two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps, in the case of chloroformate, the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are another set.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at position 1, so the ring would have symmetry across the 1-4 axis. So protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent, with the para proton at 4 being a singlet. But the NMR data doesn't show a singlet, only two doublets. So perhaps in this case, the para proton (position 4) isn't present because it's a substituent. But wait, the substituent is at position 1, so position 4 is just another H. Hmm, no, position 4 would have a H.

Wait, wait, no, if the substituent is at position 1 (like O=C(OCl)-Ph), then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent, positions 3 and 5 are across, and position 4 is the para position. So if position 4 has a H, but the substituent is at 1, it's not a para substituent, but rather a substituent at 1, so position 4 is a H.

In such a case, the NMR would have four aromatic protons: 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, that's four? No, the ring has six positions, substituent at 1. So the ring has H at 2,3,4,5,6. So five Hs? No, because substituent is at 1, so the other five are Hs? No, wait, no, substituent at 1, so Hs at 2,3,4,5,6. So five Hs. But the NMR data shows four Hs (2 doublets ×2H each). So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't para substituted but in another position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents at position 2 (Cl) and position 1 (COOH). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. So the aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6.

So in this case, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. The substituents are at adjacent positions. So the ring would have a meta substitution. Wait, but how would that affect the NMR? Hmm.

In the NMR, the protons would be at 3,4,5,6. But with substituents at 1 and 2, the symmetry might be lower. So the protons at 3 and 5 would each be adjacent to substituents, but I'm not sure about their splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR would show a more complex splitting pattern, not just two doublets.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each set being a doublet.

Wait, let me think about option C again. If the structure is phenyl chloroformate, the substituent is at position 1. The ring would then have symmetry across the 1-4 axis. So the aromatic protons would be at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, no, substituent is at 1, so the Hs are at 2,3,4,5,6. So it's a monosubstituted benzene with a strong EWG at position 1.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would be split into ortho, meta, and para positions. The ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The meta protons (3 and 5) would be less deshielded, and the para proton (4) would be the least deshielded. But I'm not sure if the NMR would show two doublets each of 2H. Or perhaps the coupling between ortho and meta protons leads to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the NMR is showing only the ortho and meta as two doublets. But without more data, it's hard to say.

Let me go back to the NMR data. At 11.0 ppm, a singlet, which is likely an -OH group. But in the options, which have an -OH group?

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That has an -OH. But the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0, which could be the -OH, but that would imply a carboxylic acid (since phenolic OHs are around 5-7 ppm, broad). Wait, no, phenolic OHs are around 5-7, but carboxylic acids are around 10-12.

Hmm, in option A, the structure has a hydroxyl group at position 2, which is a phenolic OH, right? Because it's attached to an aromatic ring. Phenolic OHs typically appear around 5-7 ppm, broad. But the NMR here shows an 11.0 ppm singlet, which is more like a carboxylic acid or maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are lower, around 9-10.

So if the 11.0 ppm is a singlet, that's more consistent with a carboxylic acid. So that suggests that options B and D are more likely, as they have COOH groups.

So the IR would have a broad peak for the COOH O-H and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 for the carbonyl.

So the 11.0 ppm peak is the COOH OH as a singlet. But wait, COOH OH is usually a broad peak. But the NMR shows it as a singlet. Could that be because it's exchanging rapidly, appearing as a singlet? Or maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that's unlikely given the position.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a strong deshielded OH, like in a nitro compound, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, looking again at the IR: a strong sharp peak at 1720. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725, so 1720 is plausible. The broad peak from 3500-2700 would be the O-H stretch for the carboxylic acid. So IR data fits options B and D.

So narrowing down to B and D.

Now, the NMR of options B and D.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. The aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. As I thought earlier, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (each adjacent to COOH), and protons at 3 and 5 equivalent (each adjacent to Cl). The coupling between 2 and 3, and 6 and 5 would lead to each set being a doublet.

So the NMR would show two doublets: one around 8.0 ppm (from protons ortho to COOH), and another around 7.72 (from protons meta to COOH and ortho to Cl). That fits the data.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. COOH at position 1, Cl at 2. The aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6. Proton at 3 is adjacent to Cl, proton at 4 is para to COOH, proton at 5 is adjacent to COOH, and proton at 6 is adjacent to Cl and meta to COOH.

Wait, this would lead to more complex splitting. For example, the protons at 3 and 6 would each be next to Cl and adjacent to other protons, leading to more splitting than just doublets. So the NMR would probably show more than two doublets, which doesn't match the given data.

Therefore, option B seems more likely.

Now, looking at the mass data again. The molecular ion at 156, and a peak at 158 (32%). Earlier, I thought this might be the Cl isotope, but with one Cl, the M and M+2 would be in a 3:1 ratio, but here, the M is 100%, which suggests that perhaps the M+2 is 32%, which is about 1:3.25. Wait, that doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another possibility: the peak at 158 might be the M+2 from Cl. Let me calculate the possible ratio. For a molecule with one Cl atom, the natural abundance of Cl is about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So the molecular ion would have peaks at 156 (from 35Cl) and 158 (from 37Cl). So the ratio would be 75%:25%. But the data shows 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the peak at 158 is a fragment. For example, if the molecule loses a ClO group or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecular formula has two Cl atoms. Wait, but looking at the options, only one Cl each. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 158 is not an isotope but a fragment. Let me think: in the mass spectrum, what fragments could give 158?

If the molecular ion is 156, and the fragment at 158 is heavier, that suggests a gain of 2 mass units. Maybe Cl addition, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps a different scenario.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think about the other data. The NMR and IR seem to point towards option B or D. From the NMR, option B seems to fit better.

So putting it all together, the IR has a broad peak (OH) and a strong carbonyl (COOH). The NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH OH), and two doublets for aromatic protons (from 4-chlorobenzoic acid). The molecular weight fits. The mass data's M+2 is a bit confusing, but perhaps it's an isotope effect.

So the correct answer seems to be option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** suggest a molecular weight of 156 with a possible isotope contribution. The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, consistent with a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data includes a **singlet at 11.0 ppm**, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains a phenolic O-H group, which typically appears around 5-7 ppm in the NMR, not 11.0 ppm. Additionally, the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm, not 11.0 ppm. The IR spectrum does not strongly support this structure either, as it lacks the expected carbonyl stretching for an aldehyde.  

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group, consistent with the **broad O-H stretch in IR** and the **singlet at 11.0 ppm in NMR**. The para-substitution pattern (Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1) explains the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR: **8.02 ppm (2H)** for protons ortho to COOH and **7.72 ppm (2H)** for protons meta to COOH. The molecular weight of 156 matches the molecular ion peak, and the IR carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ aligns with a carboxylic acid.  

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains a carbonyl group, but its stretching frequency is typically higher (around 1780-1760 cm⁻¹ for a chloroformate), which does not match the IR data. Additionally, the NMR would likely show a more complex splitting pattern due to the asymmetry of the chloroformate group, inconsistent with the observed two doublets.  

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group, consistent with the IR and NMR data. However, the substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl) would result in a less symmetric aromatic ring, leading to a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, inconsistent with the observed two doublets.  

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR, NMR, and substitution pattern, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.  

**Answer: B**
