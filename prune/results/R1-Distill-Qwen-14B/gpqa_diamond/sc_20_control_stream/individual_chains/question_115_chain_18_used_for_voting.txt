Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I think I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they usually produce gamma photons. But wait, the question says they produce two photons. And both photons have the same energy. Interesting.

Let me try to visualize the setup. There's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So, its direction is to the right. And a positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, so its direction is to the left. Wait, but wait, no: the problem says that the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, the positron is going to the left? Or wait, maybe from the right, moving into the same direction as the electron? Wait, no, they're colliding, so probably they're moving towards each other. So, the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left, colliding somewhere in the middle.

Both have Lorentz factors given. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2. Oh wait, Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, higher gamma means higher velocity.

So, their velocities are different. But when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So, both photons are moving towards the right, but one is above the horizontal and one is below.

Wait, but if they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Because before the collision, there's the electron and positron, and after, only photons. So, initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron, and the total energy is the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, but wait, since these are electron and positron, their rest mass is the same. The rest energy for each is m*c². For an electron, m is about 9.1e-31 kg, but in terms of energy, it's about 0.511 MeV each. So, the initial rest energies are 0.511 MeV each, but with their Lorentz factors, their total energies will be gamma * m c².

So, the total energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m c². Gamma_e is 4, gamma_p is 2. So, total energy is (4 + 2) * 0.511 MeV = 6 * 0.511 = 3.066 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So same m. So, yes, gamma_e is 4, gamma_p is 2.

Now, the momenta. The electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. The momentum p for each is gamma * m v, but v can be expressed in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each particle's momentum in terms of gamma. So, for a particle moving at speed v, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. But since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can express v in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of gamma and beta. Beta is v/c, so for each particle:

p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, for the electron, gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 -1/16) = sqrt(15/16)=sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is to the left. So, its beta is negative? Because if the electron is moving to the right (beta positive), the positron moving to the left (beta negative). So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m * beta_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m sqrt(15) c.

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly. Wait, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1-1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4. So, v_e = beta_e c = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ (3.87298/4) c ≈ 0.9682c.

Similarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, so v_p = beta_p c = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866c.

So, the electron is moving to the right (positive x direction) with momentum p_e = gamma_e * m beta_e c = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m * sqrt(15) * c.

Wait, because gamma_e = 4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4, so p_e = gamma_e * m * beta_e c = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m * sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, the positron is moving to the left (negative x direction), so its momentum p_p is gamma_p * m * beta_p c, but in negative direction. So, p_p = - gamma_p * m * beta_p c = -2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) c = - m sqrt(3) c.

So, the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m sqrt(15) c - m sqrt(3) c = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait, since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So, the initial momentum is electron's positive and positron's negative.

So, initial momentum is (p_e) + (p_p) = [m sqrt(15) c] + [ - m sqrt(3) c ] = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, this is the total momentum before collision. After collision, the two photons must carry away this momentum. But photons carry momentum p_photon = E_photon / c. And the direction of each photon's momentum is the same as its direction of travel.

Wait, but each photon's momentum is a vector. So, the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial momentum, which is in the x direction (since the initial momenta are along x). Also, the energies of the photons are the same, so E1 = E2 = E.

The photons' directions are upper-right and lower-right, so their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Wait, let's see. The upper-right direction would be at some angle theta above the x-axis, and the lower-right direction is theta below the x-axis. But the question says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So, their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, but in that case, their momenta in the y-direction would be equal and opposite, so they would cancel each other, leaving only a net momentum in the x-direction. That makes sense because the initial momentum is along x.

So, let me model this. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1's momentum vector: (E/c) in x and E/c sin(theta) in y, where theta is the angle above the x-axis.

Photon 2's momentum vector: (E/c) in x (since it's in lower-right, same direction of x) and -(E/c) sin(theta) in y (since it's below x-axis).

So, total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

Sum in x: (E/(c)) [1 + 1] = 2E/(c).

Sum in y: (E/(c)) sin(theta) - (E/(c)) sin(theta) = 0.

So, the total momentum after is (2E/c) in x-direction.

But the initial total momentum is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait, the initial total momentum is in the x direction, and after, the total momentum is (2E/c) in x.

So, from conservation of momentum, 2E/c = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, because initial momentum was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), and after, it's 2E/(c) = that value.

So, 2E/c = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait, the initial momentum was [gamma_e m beta_e c] + [gamma_p m beta_p (-c)] ?

Wait, no, because the positron's beta is positive when moving to the right, but here it's moving to the left. So, beta_p is positive, but the direction is opposite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial momentum. Let me re-calculate.

Electron is moving to the right (x+ direction), so its velocity is v_e = beta_e c. Its momentum is p_e = gamma_e m v_e = gamma_e m beta_e c.

Positron is moving to the left (x- direction), so its velocity is v_p = -beta_p c. Its momentum is p_p = gamma_p m v_p = gamma_p m (-beta_p c).

So, the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = gamma_e m beta_e c - gamma_p m beta_p c.

So, substituting the values:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

gamma_p =2, beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, p_initial = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) * c - 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) * c.

Simplify each term:

4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m * sqrt(15) c.

2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m sqrt(3) c.

So, p_initial = m sqrt(15) c - m sqrt(3) c = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Which is the same as before. So, total initial momentum is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction.

After annihilation, the two photons' momenta sum up to that.

Each photon has energy E, so each has momentum E/c.

Photon 1: direction is upper-right, so its momentum vector is (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta)).

Photon 2: direction is lower-right, so (E/c) (cos(theta), - sin(theta)).

Adding their momenta:

Total x: E/c [cos(theta) + cos(theta)] = 2 (E/c) cos(theta).

Total y: E/c [sin(theta) - sin(theta)] = 0.

So, the total momentum after is 2 (E/c) cos(theta) in x-direction, and 0 in y-direction. So, this must equal the initial momentum.

So, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, E = [ m c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta)).

But wait, the total energy before collision is the sum of energies of the electron and positron.

Electron's energy: gamma_e m c² = 4 m c².

Positron's energy: gamma_p m c² = 2 m c².

Total energy before: 6 m c².

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies, which is E + E = 2E.

So, from conservation of energy, 2E = 6 m c².

Therefore, E = 3 m c².

Wait, because 2E =6 m c² → E=3 m c².

So, substituting E into the momentum equation:

3 m c² = [ m c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta)).

Wait, let me write that correctly.

From the momentum equation:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But E is 3 m c². So, substituting:

2 (3 m c² / c) cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify 3 m c² / c → 3 m c.

So, 2 * 3 m c * cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

That's 6 m c cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Compute the value of [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Compute sqrt(15): ≈ 3.87298.

sqrt(3): ≈ 1.73205.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: ≈ 0.356822.

So, cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568.

What's theta? Well, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, but this is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. So, the two photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, each at theta ≈ 69 degrees from the x-direction.

So, the angle between the two photons would be 2 * theta. Because one is at +theta, the other at -theta, so the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, wait, no. Because the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their separation is 2 * theta, but theta is measured from the x-axis.

Wait, let me think: if one photon is at angle theta above x, and the other at theta below x, then the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, angle between the two photons is 2 * theta.

But wait, the initial calculation gives theta ≈ 69 degrees. So, 2 theta would be about 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me think again. When I computed the momentum equation, I found theta as the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. So, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.

Wait, but wait, no. Because one is above, the other below, so the angle between them is 2 theta. For example, if theta is 30 degrees, then the angle between them is 60 degrees.

So, in our case, theta is about 69 degrees, so 2 theta is about 138 degrees. Hmm, that's one of the options. Option C is 138, which matches this.

But let me confirm the calculations again.

We had:

cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6 ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 ≈ (2.14093)/6 ≈ 0.35682.

So theta = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees. So, 2 theta ≈ 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the options list includes 138, which is option C.

So, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.

But wait, another point: the question says that both photons have the same energy. From this setup, that makes sense because the electrons and positrons have different energies, but the photons must balance the momentum in a symmetric way.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the initial momentum was in the x-direction, and the photons' momenta are symmetric about the x-axis, so their y-components cancel. So, their x-components add up to the initial momentum.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in terms of angles, each photon makes an angle theta with the x-axis, one above, one below. So, the angle between them is 2 theta, which is approximately 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum principles. The electron and positron collide head-on, moving along the horizontal axis, and annihilate into two photons of equal energy. The photons are emitted in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making symmetric angles with the x-axis.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The electron has a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and its velocity \( v_e = \beta_e c = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c \). Its momentum is:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m \beta_e c = 4m \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m \sqrt{15} c.
     \]
   - The positron has a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_p = 2 \), and its velocity \( v_p = \beta_p c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c \). Its momentum is:
     \[
     p_p = \gamma_p m \beta_p c = 2m \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m \sqrt{3} c.
     \]
   - Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m \sqrt{15} c - m \sqrt{3} c = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - After annihilation, the photons carry total momentum. Each photon has energy \( E \) and momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c} \). The photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the x-axis, making angles \( \theta \) with the x-axis. Their total momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = \frac{E}{c} \cdot 2 \cos\theta \hat{x}.
     \]
   - From conservation of momentum:
     \[
     \frac{2E}{c} \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

3. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = 4m c^2 + 2m c^2 = 6m c^2.
     \]
   - After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons:
     \[
     2E = 6m c^2 \implies E = 3m c^2.
     \]

4. **Solve for \( \cos\theta \)**:
   - Substituting \( E = 3m c^2 \) into the momentum equation:
     \[
     \frac{2(3m c^2)}{c} \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
     \]
     \[
     6m c \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
     \]
   - Numerically:
     \[
     \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.140.
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3568.
     \]
   - The angle \( \theta \) is:
     \[
     \theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The two photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the x-axis, each at an angle \( \theta \) from the x-axis. The angle between them is:
     \[
     2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
