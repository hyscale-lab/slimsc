Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when light moves through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving here. How does that affect things?

The question says the glass has an index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, okay, so the light is moving through the glass. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light would be c/n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index. So, when the glass isn't moving, the speed is v_light = c/n.

But in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So I think I need to use some sort of velocity addition formula. Oh, right, maybe like the relativistic velocity addition? Wait, but is this a relativistic scenario or non-relativistic?

The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So perhaps it's using units where c=1, which is common in relativity. So the velocities are fractions of c.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v. So in the lab frame, the glass's speed is v, and the light is moving at c/n in the glass's frame. So to find the speed in the lab frame, I should add the velocities.

But wait, velocity addition isn't just simple addition because of relativity. The standard formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

But wait, u' is the speed of light in glass's frame. So u' is c/n, which is 1/n. So substituting, the speed in lab frame would be ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ) = [ (1 + n v ) / n ] / [ (n + v)/n ].

Wait, let me compute this step by step. The numerator is 1/n + v. Let me write it as (1 + n v)/n. The denominator is 1 + (v * 1/n). So that's (n + v)/n. So when I divide numerator by denominator, the n's cancel out, right? So (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. So when we add the velocity of the glass (v) moving in the same direction, the lab frame speed would be (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), but since c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

Substituting u' = 1/n:

Speed = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fraction:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n (1) + v → n + v

So the speed becomes (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which matches option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm assuming that the velocity addition formula applies here. But in the case where the medium itself is moving, does that formula still hold? Because the velocity addition in relativity is about transforming between inertial frames. The glass is moving at v relative to the lab, so the frame of the glass is moving at v relative to lab.

Wait, but the light's speed in the glass frame is c/n. So when I transform it to the lab frame, I use the velocity addition formula. So that should be correct.

So the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Option B is 1, which would be the speed of light in vacuum, but the light is in glass, so that's probably not.

Option C is (1 +n v)/(n - v)—that's a different denominator.

Option D is (1 -n v)/(n +v), which is negative if n>1 and v is positive.

Wait, but if n=1, the speed would be (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1, which makes sense because when n=1, it's like vacuum, and the speed should remain c=1, regardless of the medium's velocity. But wait, if the medium is moving, shouldn't the speed change? Hmm, wait, no, because in vacuum, n=1, and light's speed is always c regardless of the medium's motion. Wait, but in this problem, when n=1, the glass is actually a vacuum. So if the vacuum is moving, would the light still be at c?

Wait, according to relativity, the speed of light in vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. So if the medium is a vacuum (n=1) moving at v, the speed of light should still be c. Let's check our formula when n=1.

Our formula for speed would be (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1, which is correct. So that checks out.

Another test: if n is large, say n approaches infinity (like a very dense medium). Then the light's speed in the medium would be 1/n ≈0. But the medium is moving at speed v. So the speed in lab frame would be (0 +v)/(1 +0) =v. But wait, our formula when n is large: (1 +n v)/(n +v) → (n v)/(n) ) → v. So that makes sense because the light's speed in the medium is negligible, so it's just moving at the speed of the medium.

Wait, but what if the medium is moving in the opposite direction? Oh, but in this problem, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light. So I think the formula is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of light in the glass's rest frame**: In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (the speed of light in a vacuum) and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

2. **Relative motion of the glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   v_{\text{lab}} = \frac{v_{\text{glass}} + v}{1 + v_{\text{glass}} \cdot v},
   \]
   where \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.

3. **Substitute \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \)**:
   \[
   v_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} \cdot v}.
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression**:
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   v_{\text{lab}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}.
   \]

5. **Check consistency with options**:
   - Option A: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression.
   - Option B: \( 1 \) is incorrect because it represents the speed of light in a vacuum, not in the glass.
   - Option C: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator does not match the derived expression.
   - Option D: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator does not match the derived expression.

6. **Verification with special cases**:
   - If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light should remain \( 1 \) in the laboratory frame, which matches the formula \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \).
   - If \( n \to \infty \) (light speed in the glass is negligible), the formula simplifies to \( v_{\text{lab}} \approx v \), which is consistent with the light moving at the speed of the medium.

Thus, the correct answer is:
