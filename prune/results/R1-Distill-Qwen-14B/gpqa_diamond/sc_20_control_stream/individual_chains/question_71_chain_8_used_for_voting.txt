Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's read it again.

Alright, the setup is that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, found using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All planets have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, that's based on the distance from their star. The formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But I think another version is T = T_eff (star) * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2), assuming the star's temperature is T_eff and radius R_star.

But wait, the planets' orbital periods ratio is given. So orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³, with the proportionality depending on the mass of the star (but since all planets are around the same star, we can ignore that for the ratio).

So, the idea is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_4 and Planet_2, then plug that into the temperature formula.

Let me see. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet 1 has period P1, Planet 2 is 2 P1, Planet 3 is 2.5 P1, Planet 4 is 3.5 P1, Planet 5 is 5 P1.

Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ a^3. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the ratio of a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).

P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1. So P4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Alternatively, compute 1.75^(2/3) numerically.

Let me think: cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2, because 1.2^3 is about 1.728. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2. Then square that: 1.2^2 is 1.44. So a4 is about 1.44 times a2.

Wait, but wait: because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4 is (3.5)^(2/3) * a1, and a2 is (2)^(2/3) * a1. So a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Which is what I did.

Alternatively, 3.5 is 7/2, 2 is 2/1, so (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm.

Wait, another way: 1.75 is 7/4. Let me compute ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.373. Take exp(0.373) ≈ 1.452. So a4/a2 is about 1.452.

Wait, but wait, the temperature ratio is T4/T2. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), because R and T_star are the same for all planets.

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a4). So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1/(a4/a2)) ) = 1/(a4/a2)^(1/2).

Since a4/a2 ≈1.452, then sqrt(1.452) ≈ 1.205. So T4/T2 ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let's check: sqrt(1.452) is about 1.205, right? So 1/1.205 is approximately 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps.

1. P ratios: P1, P2=2 P1, P4=3.5 P1.

2. a ∝ P^(2/3), so a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that accurately.

Compute 1.75^(1/3): cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root is about 1.2009. So 1.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.2009. Then square that: (1.2009)^2 ≈ 1.442.

So a4/a2 = 1.442.

3. T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.442) ≈ sqrt(0.694) ≈ 0.833.

So that's about 0.83, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by analyzing the given orbital period ratios: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\). Thus, the ratio of semi-major axes \(a_4/a_2\) is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

From the period ratios, \(P_4 = 3.5P_1\) and \(P_2 = 2P_1\), so:

\[
\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75.
\]

Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

To compute \(1.75^{2/3}\), note that \(1.75 = 7/4\). Taking the cube root of \(1.75\) gives approximately \(1.2009\), and squaring this yields:

\[
(1.75)^{2/3} \approx 1.442.
\]

Thus, \(a_4/a_2 \approx 1.442\).

The equilibrium temperature \(T\) is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{a}\), so the temperature ratio \(T_4/T_2\) is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.442}}.
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{1.442}} \approx \sqrt{0.694} \approx 0.833.
\]

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\), which corresponds to option C.

P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1. So P4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Alternatively, compute 1.75^(2/3) numerically.

Wait, but wait: because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4 is (3.5)^(2/3) * a1, and a2 is (2)^(2/3) * a1. So a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Which is what I did.

Wait, but wait, the temperature ratio is T4/T2. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), because R and T_star are the same for all planets.

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a4). So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1/(a4/a2)) ) = 1/(a4/a2)^(1/2).

Since a4/a2 ≈1.452, then sqrt(1.452) ≈ 1.205. So T4/T2 ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let's check: sqrt(1.452) is about 1.205, right? So 1/1.205 is approximately 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps.

1. P ratios: P1, P2=2 P1, P4=3.5 P1.

2. a ∝ P^(2/3), so a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that accurately.

Compute 1.75^(1/3): cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root is about 1.2009. So 1.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.2009. Then square that: (1.2009)^2 ≈ 1.442.

3. T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.442) ≈ sqrt(0.694) ≈ 0.833.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by analyzing the given orbital period ratios: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\). Thus, the ratio of semi-major axes \(a_4/a_2\) is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

From the period ratios, \(P_4 = 3.5P_1\) and \(P_2 = 2P_1\), so:

\[
\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75.
\]

Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

To compute \(1.75^{2/3}\), note that \(1.75 = 7/4\). Taking the cube root of \(1.75\) gives approximately \(1.2009\), and squaring this yields:

\[
(1.75)^{2/3} \approx 1.442.
\]

Thus, \(a_4/a_2 \approx 1.442\).

The equilibrium temperature \(T\) is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{a}\), so the temperature ratio \(T_4/T_2\) is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.442}}.
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{1.442}} \approx \sqrt{0.694} \approx 0.833.
\]

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\), which corresponds to option C.
