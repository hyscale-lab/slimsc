Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Hmm, wait, what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's bromobenzene with another substituent on the ring. Wait, noâ€”wait, 1 and 2 positions on benzene. So the bromine is at position 1, and another substituent (maybe deuterium or something else) at position 2? Wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, the 'd' probably refers to deuterium. So it's bromobenzene with a deuterium at the adjacent position, position 2.

Wait, but wait, benzene rings are symmetric, so maybe the substituents are in the para or meta positions? Oh no, wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so it's ortho. So the structure is bromine at position 1, and deuterium at position 2. So the ring has Br at one carbon and D at the next.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. But wait, sometimes it's used in elimination reactions or for aromatic substitution.

Wait, aromatic substitution? Let me think. Benzene rings with substituents undergo substitution based on activating or deactivating groups. But bromine is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So in electrophilic substitution, the incoming group would go to the meta position relative to Br.

But wait, the starting material isn't a simple bromobenzene; it's 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2.

I'm trying to figure out what reaction NaNH2 would induce here. Another possibility is that it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that's for alkanes, like E2 elimination. But this is an aromatic compound. Maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution? Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base; maybe it abstracts a proton, leading to some kind of elimination or ring modification.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehalogenation. Wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: if the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation followed by elimination.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. 1-bromobenzene-2-d: the benzene ring has Br on C1 and D on C2. So adjacent positions.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2. NaNH2 is a strong base; in such conditions, perhaps it's deprotonating something. Where are the protons available on the ring?

In bromobenzene, the ring is electron-deficient because of the electronegative Br. So the protons are ortho and para to Br. But wait, in this case, position 2 is already substituted with D, so perhaps the H's are in other positions.

Wait, wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, in the benzene ring, position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, and the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H's.

So the hydrogen atoms would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Since Br is a deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, but the positions ortho and para to Br are the most activated in terms of electron density.

But with Br on C1, the ortho positions are C2 and C6. C2 already has a D, so the next possible position is C6, which is ortho to Br. C4 is para to Br.

Wait, but in this case, because the Br is at C1, the adjacent (ortho) positions are C2 and C6. C2 is already occupied by D, so the other ortho position is C6, which would be H in this case.

So if NaNH2 abstracts a proton, maybe from C6 (ortho to Br) or C4 (para to Br). Let me think about the acidity of those protons.

In aromatic rings, the acidity of protons can be influenced by substituents. Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deactivate the ring but also make the adjacent protons more acidic. Because the ring's electron density is lower, the protons are more acidic.

So, in the case of 1-bromobenzene, the ortho and para protons are more acidic than the meta ones. So in our case, the H at C6 is ortho to Br, and the H at C4 is para to Br. Both are more acidic than, say, C3 or C5, which are meta to Br.

So when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, the base would deprotonate the ring. Which protons would it abstract?

Well, the most acidic protons would be the ones most activated. So the ortho position (C6) would be more acidic than para? Or is it the opposite? Hmm.

Wait, in the case of nitro groups, which are strongly deactivating, the ortho and para positions are the most acidic. So similar here, but Br is weaker than nitro.

So, in 1-bromobenzene, the H's ortho (C6) and para (C4) to Br are more acidic than the meta (C3 and C5). So, the base would abstract protons from either C4 or C6.

But wait, in our case, the substituents are Br at C1 and D at C2. So, the positions adjacent to D are C1 and C3. Wait, but D is a deuterium; it's a heavy isotope but doesn't affect the acidity in the same way as a hydrogen. So the presence of D at C2 might influence the acidity of adjacent H's.

Wait, but D is a substituent on the ring. Let me think about the effect of D on the acidity. Deuterium is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen, but in this case, perhaps the substituent effect is minimal because it's just a single D.

So going back, the base would abstract the H from either C4 or C6, which are para and ortho to Br.

Once deprotonated, what happens next? Well, in such conditions, perhaps elimination occurs, but benzene doesn't typically undergo elimination. Alternatively, the deprotonation could lead to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's more in cyclic systems like cyclohexadienes.

Wait a second, another possibility: aromatic substitution. If the base abstracts a proton, perhaps a benzene ring with a negative charge could form, leading to a substitution reaction.

Wait, but benzene is usually pretty stable. Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to a biradical or some other intermediate.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is usually the case when there are strong electron-withdrawing groups present. Br is an EWG, but perhaps not strong enough for nucleophilic substitution under these conditions.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base and a source of NH2^- ions. Maybe the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ring.

In aromatic nucleophilic substitution, the ring must be activated (like having strong EWG) so that the ring can support a negative charge. So if the ring has multiple EWGs, the substitution can occur.

In our case, the ring has Br at C1 and D at C2. So perhaps the NH2^- would attack at a position activated towards nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about what the product would be.

If the base abstracts a proton from C4 (para to Br), then the ring would have a negative charge at C4. Then, perhaps the NH2^- could attack there. Alternatively, maybe elimination occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps when the base deprotonates the ring, the ring becomes more susceptible to attack. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think differently. Another reaction I remember is the possibility of a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that's for electrophilic substitution. Since we're using a strong base, maybe it's a different kind of substitution.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is already fully conjugated.

Wait, no, maybe it's forming a quinonoid structure or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: when a benzene ring has a substituent, like Br, and a strong base is present, sometimes the base abstracts a proton alpha to the substituent, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate. But wait, benzynes are typically formed when two protons are abstracted adjacent to each other, leading to a diradical or a triple bond.

Wait, benzynes are usually formed via dehydrohalogenation of dihalobenzenes. For example, 1,2-dihalobenzene treated with a strong base can lose two halides to form a triple bond (benzyne). But in this case, we only have Br and D on adjacent positions. But D is a deuterium, not a halogen. So maybe that's not applicable.

Wait a second, but in our case, we have Br on C1 and D on C2. So, if the base abstracts a proton from C2, but wait, C2 is D, so it can't be abstracted. So the base can't abstract the D, but could it abstract a neighboring H?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me draw the structure. Let's number the benzene ring as follows: positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and then 3,4,5,6 with H.

So, structure is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no, benzene is a hexagon. So position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, and then the other positions are H.

If I treat this with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it might abstract a proton that's acidic. As I thought earlier, the acidic protons are at positions ortho and para to Br.

So, position 6 is ortho to Br (since 1 is Br, 6 is adjacent), and position 4 is para to Br.

So the base could abstract either the H at position 6 (ortho) or position 4 (para). So two possible sites.

Once that proton is abstracted, what happens?

If the H at position 6 is abstracted, the negative charge would be at C6. Then, what's next? Maybe the NH2^- would attack, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination of Br occurs. Wait, no, because Br is a good leaving group but in an aromatic ring, elimination isn't straightforward.

Wait, another possibility: the deprotonation leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring undergoes a substitution: the Br leaves, and something else comes in. But for that, I'd need a good leaving group, and the conditions for elimination.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then could undergo some kind of attack. But I'm not certain about the specific mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with an amino group. If the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ring, then substitution occurs.

But for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated. Since Br is an EWG, it might help in some cases. Additionally, the presence of strong EWGs in the ring can activate it towards nucleophilic attack.

Wait, so in this case, the ring has Br and D. Br is an EWG, so perhaps the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution at certain positions.

But which positions?

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the incoming nucleophile would attack at the position ortho or para to the EWG, depending on the number and position of substituents.

Wait, in the case of a single EWG (like Br), the ring is activated for nucleophilic attack at the ortho and para positions relative to the EWG. Because those are the positions where the ring's electron density is highest.

Wait, but Br is deactivating, so perhaps the ring is less reactive. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. For nucleophilic substitution, the ring must be electron-deficient, which Br contributes to.

So, perhaps the NH2^- would attack the ring at the para position relative to Br. Or wait, no, maybe the meta position?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. In electrophilic substitution, the substituents direct the incoming group. For example, meta directors (like NO2) direct incoming groups to the meta position. But for nucleophilic substitution, the directing effects are different.

In nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings, the substituents that are strong EWGs (like NO2) activate the ring towards nucleophilic attack because they withdraw electron density, making the ring more electrophilic. The nucleophile attacks the positions where the ring is most electron-deficient. So, for a single EWG like Br, the positions ortho and para to Br are activated for nucleophilic attack.

Wait, no. Wait, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the EWG directs the nucleophile to the positions that are meta to itself. Because the EWG deactivates the ring, making it harder for the nucleophile to attack directly adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the meta position is more activated. Hmm, I'm not confident.

Wait, I think that in nucleophilic substitution, the substituents that are strong EWGs direct the incoming nucleophile to the meta position. For example, in a nitrobenzene derivative, the nucleophile attacks the meta position relative to the nitro group. Or wait, maybe it's the ortho and para positions again.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to a mnemonic: for nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings, the substituents that are strong EWGs activate the ring at positions that are meta to themselves. So, the nucleophile attacks the meta position relative to the EWG.

So in our case, the Br is at C1. So the meta positions would be C4. Because, meta is three positions away. So C1, C2, C3 (next), C4 would be meta to C1.

Wait, because in a benzene ring, the positions are numbered in a circle. So for position C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: for a benzene ring, the positions are adjacent as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the meta position to 1 would be 3 and 5. But in our case, C1 is Br, C2 is D, so the positions adjacent are 6 (which is ortho to 1), and 2 (also ortho), but 2 is D. So the para position to C1 is C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the directing effects wrong. Let me think again.

In nucleophilic substitution, the substituent directs the nucleophile to certain positions. For example, a nitro group (a strong EWG) is a meta director for nucleophilic substitution, meaning the nucleophile attacks the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, so in our case, Br is a weaker EWG, but it's still an EWG. So, perhaps the nucleophile would attack the meta positions relative to Br, which are C3 and C5.

But wait, in our starting material, C2 has D, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So, the positions available for attack are:

- C3: adjacent to C2 (D) and meta to Br.

- C4: para to Br.

- C5: meta to Br.

- C6: ortho to Br.

Wait, but the base abstracts a proton from either C4 or C6, as those are the acidic positions.

So, perhaps after deprotonation, the ring can undergo substitution.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from C6, which is ortho to Br, then the ring has a negative charge at C6.

Alternatively, if it abstracts from C4, then the negative charge is at C4.

But I'm not sure how this leads to substitution. Maybe the Br leaves, and the NH2^- comes in.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination-addition mechanism. Like, the Br leaves, forming a benzyn intermediate, but that's more common with two leaving groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to formation of a carbanion, which then attacks with NH2^-.

Wait, another possibility is that the deprotonation leads to a ring expansion, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms aniline derivatives. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products form.

If the reaction leads to substitution at C6 (ortho to Br), then the product would be D at C2, Br at C1, and NH2 at C6.

Wait, but that would require substitution at C6, which is ortho to Br. Alternatively, substitution could occur at C4 (para to Br) or C3 or C5 (meta positions).

Wait, but the starting material already has D at C2. So if substitution occurs, where are the possible positions?

Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by NH2. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene.

But wait, in nucleophilic substitution, the incoming nucleophile replaces the leaving group. So in this case, Br is the leaving group, and NH2^- would substitute in its place. But would that happen?

Wait, but in aromatic nucleophilic substitution, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. I'm not sure if Br is a good enough leaving group under these conditions. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require the formation of a triple bond in the ring (benzyne), but I don't see how that's possible with only Br and D on adjacent positions.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from C6, leading to a carbanion, which then loses Br as a leaving group. Then, a benzyn intermediate could form, but I think that's only possible if there are two adjacent leaving groups. Since we have only Br and D, perhaps that's not feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another approach. The reaction of bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia.

Wait, I think I remember that NaNH2 can induce elimination in certain cases. For example, in aliphatic compounds, it can abstract protons to form double bonds. But for benzene rings, perhaps it abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that usually involves metals like Na or Mg and ammonia, and it reduces aromatic rings, which doesn't seem to fit here.

Wait, another thought: the base could abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a benzoxide ion. Then, perhaps the NH2^- could attack, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products.

If the reaction leads to substitution at two different positions (ortho and para), then we could have two products. Alternatively, if substitution occurs at those positions, plus another position, it could be more.

Wait, but the starting material has Br at C1 and D at C2. Let's imagine that after deprotonation at C6 (ortho to Br), the NH2^- could attack at C6, leading to NH2 at C6, Br at C1, and D at C2.

Alternatively, deprotonation at C4 (para to Br), and NH2^- attacks there, leading to NH2 at C4.

Wait, but if the substitution occurs, the Br would leave, right? Because it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, the leaving group would have to be a good one. Br is a decent leaving group under certain conditions. So, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2.

So, possible substitution at C4 (para to Br) would give 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. Substitution at C6 (ortho to Br) would give 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. If substitution occurs at C6, the product would be 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. If substitution is at C4, it would be 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

Additionally, could there be substitution at other positions?

Wait, I thought that meta positions to Br are C3 and C5. But in this case, those positions are H's, so in theory, substitution could occur there as well. But wait, why would the nucleophile attack meta to Br?

Because in nucleophilic substitution, the EWG directs the nucleophile to the meta positions. So if Br is at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5.

So, if substitution occurs at C3, the product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. Similarly, substitution at C5 would give 5-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

Wait, so that's four possible positions: ortho (C6), para (C4), meta (C3 and C5). But wait, in the starting material, C2 is D, so C3 is adjacent to C2, which is D. Would that affect the acidity or reactivity of C3?

Hmm, perhaps the presence of D at C2 affects the acidity of C3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the ring (Br and D) make certain positions more reactive for substitution.

If substitution can occur at C3, C4, C5, and C6, that would be four possible products. But wait, in the starting material, the substituents are at C1 (Br) and C2 (D). So, when considering substitution, the para position is C4, ortho is C6, and meta would be C3 and C5.

Thus, if substitution occurs at all four positions, that's four products. But wait, I'm not sure if all those positions are possible under the given conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only occurs at the most acidic positions, which are ortho and para to Br, leading to two products.

Wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if substitution occurs in four positions (ortho, para, and two meta), that would be four products. But considering that the starting material already has D at C2, perhaps substitution is not possible at C3 because of steric hindrance or other effects.

Wait, but D is a small substituent, so steric hindrance is probably minimal. So, the presence of D at C2 might not prevent substitution at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of only two products, because only ortho and para positions are acidic enough for deprotonation, leading to substitution.

Wait, let's think again about the base's ability to abstract protons. The more acidic the proton, the more likely it is to be abstracted. Ortho and para protons to Br are more acidic than meta. So, perhaps the base abstracts H from C6 (ortho) and C4 (para), leading to substitution at those positions. The meta protons (C3 and C5) are less acidic, so they might not be abstracted under these conditions.

Therefore, substitution would occur at C6 and C4, leading to two products.

Wait, but then what about the D at C2? Could that affect the substitution at C3? For example, perhaps the D at C2 makes the C3 proton less acidic, so it's not abstracted. If that's the case, then substitution would only occur at C4 and C6, leading to two products.

Alternatively, maybe the D at C2 doesn't significantly affect the acidity of C3, so the C3 proton could be abstracted, leading to substitution there. But I'm not certain.

So, if substitution occurs at C3, C4, C5, and C6, that's four products. If only at C4 and C6, two products. Or perhaps at C4, C5, and C6, three products.

Wait, another angle: the solvent is condensed ammonia. NaNH2 in NH3 is a strong base, but sometimes it's also a source of NH2^- ions. So, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution where Br is replaced by NH2.

If that's the case, then the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. So only one product? But wait, that's substitution at the same position as Br, which was C1.

Wait, but the starting material has Br at C1. If substitution occurs, the Br would be replaced by NH2, leading to 1-amino-2-d benzene. That would be a single product.

But wait, in that case, where are the other possible products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't substitute the Br, but instead abstracts a proton leading to a ring expansion or something else.

I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me try to think of possible products.

If the reaction is a substitution, replacing Br with NH2, then only one product is formed: 1-amino-2-d benzene.

If the reaction abstracts a proton and forms a ring with an amino group in a different position, then more products are possible.

But I'm not certain. Let me consider another approach: how many positions are activated for substitution.

Assuming substitution can occur at C3, C4, C5, and C6.

But the presence of D at C2 might influence the activation. For example, maybe C3 and C6 are more activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at only the para position (C4), leading to one product.

Wait, but the question is asking how many possible products, so I need to figure out all possible outcomes.

Another thought: maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then can undergo some kind of attack. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, and the ring undergoes some rearrangement, leading to a different substitution pattern.

But I'm not well-versed in all possible mechanisms here, so perhaps I should consider the possible options and the most likely scenario.

If the reaction leads to substitution at the para position relative to Br, that would give one product. If substitution can occur at both para and ortho, that would give two products. If substitution occurs at all four possible positions (ortho, para, and two meta), that's four products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only leads to substitution at the para position, so only one product.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. If the reaction is substitution at the para position, that's C4. So the product would be 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

If substitution occurs at the ortho position (C6), the product would be 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

If substitution occurs at the meta positions (C3 and C5), you'd have 3- and 5-amino products.

But would substitution occur at the meta positions?

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the presence of a strong EWG activates the ring, and the nucleophile typically attacks the meta position relative to the EWG. So, Br at C1 would activate C3 and C5 for substitution.

But wait, in our case, substitution would be directed to the meta positions, which are C3 and C5. So, the NH2^- could attack at C3 or C5, leading to two more products.

So, in total, substitution could occur at four positions: C3, C4, C5, C6.

But wait, that's four possible substitution positions, each leading to a different product. So four products.

Wait, but the starting material has D at C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So, could substitution occur at C3, which is adjacent to D?

Hmm, but D is a substituent, so perhaps it's possible. However, the presence of D might not significantly affect the substitution's feasibility at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur at C3 and C5 because the substituents are not activating enough, or perhaps the base isn't strong enough to abstract protons at those positions.

So, perhaps only the para and ortho positions are possible, leading to two products.

Wait, but the problem is that the starting material already has a substituent at C2 (D), so substitution at C3 would be adjacent to D. I'm not sure if that's sterically hindered or not.

But if it's possible, then four products are possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but something else, like isomerization.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more common in aliphatic compounds. But perhaps in this case, it forms a triple bond in the ring, leading to a benzyn intermediate, which can then undergo various reactions.

But for benzyn formation, you typically need two halogens adjacent to each other. In our case, we have Br at C1 and D at C2. So, only one halogen, making benzyne formation unlikely.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of this differently. The question is how many possible products are formed.

Looking at the options, the choices are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the substitution occurs at only one position, answer is B)1.

If substitution occurs at two positions (para and ortho), answer is C)2.

If substitution occurs at four positions (ortho, para, and two meta), answer is A)4.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, leading to a different product.

Wait, another possibility: the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzoxide ion. Then, the Br could leave, forming a benzyn intermediate. But without a second leaving group, I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts two protons, leading to a diradical or a triple bond, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, removing Br and a proton to form a ring with a double bond. But benzene is already fully conjugated, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new ring structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about substitution but about the possibility of tautomerism or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the base induces a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more for cycloalkenes.

I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about what the most likely products are.

If the reaction is substitution at the para position, then one product.

If substitution occurs at both para and ortho, two products.

But considering that the starting material has D at C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), perhaps substitution at C6 (ortho) is possible, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution at the same position as Br, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that only one product is formed, which is substitution at the para position.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe two products are possible.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. If the reaction is substitution, the Br could be replaced by NH2, leading to 1-amino-2-d benzene. That's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, but I don't think so.

But then why would the options include multiple products?

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with two amino groups, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps I've missed something. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, which is bromobenzene with a deuterium in the ortho position.

So, in such a structure, when treated with a strong base, the base might abstract a proton that's para to Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at C4. Then, the NH2^- could attack at C4, leading to substitution at that position.

Alternatively, the base abstracts a proton at C6 (ortho to Br), and substitution occurs there.

Alternatively, maybe elimination occurs, removing Br and a proton to form a triple bond, but without the adjacent leaving group, that's not feasible.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton at C6, adjacent to Br, then perhaps the Br could leave, forming a benzene ring with a carbanion at C6, which then could react.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but simply deprotonation, leading to a carbanion, which then could capture something else, but I'm not sure what.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new products, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring with the amino group and the deuterium.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should consider that the possible products are when substitution occurs at the para position, leading to one product, and the reaction doesn't proceed elsewhere, so the answer is B)1.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: deuterium is a heavier isotope, and sometimes reactions can be influenced by kinetic isotope effects. But in this case, I don't think that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a meta product, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on what I remember, when a benzene ring has a substituent like Br, and a strong base is used, substitution can occur at the para position. So, perhaps only one product is formed.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the reaction leads to two products: substitution at para and ortho.

Wait, but I think that the para position is more likely for substitution in such cases. So, perhaps only one product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with the option that substitution occurs para to Br, leading to one product. So the answer is B)1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)3, but I can't think of why.

Wait, another approach: the base could abstract a proton from any of the acidic positions, leading to deprotonation. Each deprotonation could lead to a different substitution product.

But if substitution can occur at four positions, that's four products. If only two positions are possible, that's two products.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4, which would be if all four positions are possible. But I think that it's more likely that substitution occurs at para and ortho, leading to two products.

So the answer would be C)2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: bromobenzene with NaNH2 can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne, but that requires adjacent leaving groups. Since our starting material has Br and D, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, without a second leaving group, elimination to form benzyne isn't feasible. So perhaps substitution is the only pathway, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion at C6, which then loses Br^- to form a triple bond (benzyne), but without a second leaving group, that's not possible. So perhaps no reaction occurs, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to look for knowledge about reactions of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2.

Wait, I'm recalling that NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, used for deprotonating compounds. In the case of bromobenzene, perhaps it abstracts a proton ortho or para to Br, leading to a substituted aniline.

But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of aniline derivatives. So substitution occurs at the para position, leading to 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

But then, another possibility is substitution at the ortho position, leading to 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

So that's two possible products, leading to option C)2.

Yes, that seems plausible.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia. The structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d consists of a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which activates the ortho and para positions on the benzene ring for nucleophilic attack by making the ring more electron-deficient.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reactivity of the Ring**: Bromine directs nucleophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. In this case:
   - The ortho position to bromine is position 6.
   - The para position to bromine is position 4.

2. **Acidity of Protons**: The protons at the ortho and para positions to bromine are more acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of bromine. These positions are likely to be deprotonated by the strong base NaNHâ‚‚.

3. **Substitution Products**:
   - If substitution occurs at position 6 (ortho to bromine), the product is 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.
   - If substitution occurs at position 4 (para to bromine), the product is 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene.

4. **Meta Positions**: While bromine can also activate the meta positions (C3 and C5) for nucleophilic attack, the presence of deuterium at position 2 may reduce the likelihood of substitution at these positions due to steric or electronic effects. Thus, substitution at C3 and C5 is less likely under these conditions.

5. **Elimination or Other Pathways**: The reaction conditions (NaNHâ‚‚ in ammonia) favor nucleophilic substitution rather than elimination or other pathways. The formation of a benzyn intermediate (a triple bond in the ring) is unlikely because it requires two adjacent leaving groups, which is not the case here.

### Conclusion:
The reaction leads to substitution at the ortho and para positions relative to bromine, resulting in two possible products: 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene and 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. Substitution at the meta positions (C3 and C5) is less likely under these conditions.
