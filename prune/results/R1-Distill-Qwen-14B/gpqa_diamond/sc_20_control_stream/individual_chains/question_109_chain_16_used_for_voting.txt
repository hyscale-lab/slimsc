Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question involves two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem is about determining which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Wait, Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S the spin, L the orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. And in the final state, the NN state has T=0.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0 because 2*0+1=1, so (1)S0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. But the problem is considering the NN state after emission. So the NN state's T, S, L must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since the final T is 0, so 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L +1 is even, meaning S + L must be odd. So S + L = 1 mod 2.

Wait, S is the spin of the NN state. For two spin-1/2 particles (nucleons), the total spin S can be 0 or 1. So S can be 0 or 1. Hmm.

Wait, but what about the orbital angular momentum L? The NN state's L is determined by their orbital configuration. The particle X has some orbital angular momentum as well. So the initial state's angular momentum is J=0, so after emission, the total angular momentum must still be conserved. So the initial J is 0, so the sum of the angular momenta of NN and X must be zero.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The initial system is the two nucleons in a state with L=0 (from 1S0, which is L=0), so their orbital angular momentum is zero. When they emit a particle X, the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must add up to zero because the initial state has J=0. So the orbital angular momentum of X plus the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state should be zero? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, the initial system is the two nucleons in a 1S0 state, which has L=0. So their orbital angular momentum is zero. Then, when they emit a particle, the total angular momentum of the three-body system (two nucleons and X) must be conserved. Wait, but the problem seems to be looking at the NN state after emission, not the total system. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the focus is on the process where the NN state's angular momentum and spin combine with the X's angular momentum to conserve parity and angular momentum.

So the initial state is 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0). After emitting X, the final NN state has certain quantum numbers.

Wait, the process is the NN system emits X, so the initial state is the NN system, and the final state is NN (now possibly in a different state) plus X. The parity and angular momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L. Since L=0, parity is +1.

The parity of the final state (NN + X) must be the same. The parity of the NN state in the final is (-1)^L', where L' is their orbital angular momentum. The parity of X is given as -1.

So the parity of the final state is [ (-1)^L' ] * [ parity of X ] * [ parity of the coupling? Or is it just a product? ]

Wait, in general, when two or more particles are combined, their parities multiply. So the parity of the system is the product of the parities of each particle. So the initial parity is +1. The final parity is the product of the parities of NN and X.

So:

Initial parity: +1.

Final parity: [parity of NN] * [parity of X] = [ (-1)^L' ] * (-1) = (-1)^{L' + 1}.

So, since parity must be conserved, initial and final must be equal: (-1)^{L' +1} = +1.

Because the initial parity is +1. So (-1)^{L' +1} = 1 ==> L' +1 must be even. So L' is odd.

Therefore, L' must be odd. So the final NN state must have L' = 1, 3, 5, etc. But considering the options, probably only L' up to 3 or so is considered.

Wait, the options give the angular momentum state of X as lowercase letters, like p, s, etc. So for the X particle, the angular momentum state is given by the letter: s (0), p (1), d (2), f (3), etc.

Wait, in the options, each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a state of NN plus X. For example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the emitted X is in p state, which is l=1.

So considering each option, the X's orbital angular momentum is given. Let's think about each case.

But wait, the angular momentum conservation part is a bit tricky. The initial state has J=0. The final state must have the total angular momentum also J=0.

The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (L' and their spin S') and X's angular momentum (l).

Wait, but the problem says that the final NN state has T=0. And the condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2, where S is the spin of the NN state.

Wait, the final NN state's T is 0. So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. Therefore, S and L must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).

So for the final NN state, S is the spin quantum number (0 or 1) and L is their orbital angular momentum quantum number.

So, for the final state, S + L must be odd.

Let me think about each option.

Each option gives the NN state after emission as something like 7D1. So let's parse each option.

The format is: initial state → final NN state + X.

So for example, option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

Wait, the final NN state is 7D1. So that would mean:

The term is (2S +1) L J ? No, wait, the term is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 would be (2S+1)=7, so S=3. Because 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D, which is 2. So L=2. And J=1.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. The term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So for 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D, which is L=2. J is 1.

So the final NN state has S=3, L=2, J=1.

But our initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.

Wait, but the initial S is 0, but the final S is 3. How? Because the nucleons could have their spins change when emitting a particle, but I'm not sure how that works. Maybe the spin is part of the coupling with the emitted particle.

Wait, maybe the approach is to consider the angular momentum and parity conservation for the process.

The initial state has J=0, parity +1.

The final state is the NN state plus the emitted X.

The total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must be zero, because the initial state has J=0. So J_total = 0.

The total parity of the final state must be +1, as the initial parity is +1.

So for each option, the parity of the NN state plus the X must multiply to +1. Because parity is multiplicative.

So let's compute the parity for each case.

Parity of NN state is (-1)^L'.

Parity of X is given as -1.

So total parity is (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1). This must equal +1.

So (-1)^(L' +1) = +1 → which means that L' +1 is even → L' is odd.

So L' must be odd. So the final NN state must have an L' that's odd.

So let's look at each option's final NN state and see what L' is.

Option A: 7D1 → L' is D → 2. Which is even. But we need L' to be odd. So this would make the parity (-1)^(2+1) = -1, which doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So this would violate parity conservation. So this option is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L' is S → 0. Even. Again, 0 is even, so L' is even. So L' +1 is odd, so parity would be (-1)^1 = -1. Which doesn't match. So this is not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → L' is D →2. Even again. So same issue as A. So parity would be (-1)^(2+1) = -1. Not allowed. So this is not permitted.

Option D: 3P0 → L' is P →1. Odd. So L' +1 =2, even. So parity is (-1)^2 = +1. So this is allowed.

Wait, but let's check all options.

But wait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So from the parity consideration, options A, B, and C have even L', which would lead to parity -1. Only D has L'=1, which gives parity +1. So options A, B, C would violate parity, so they are not allowed. But the options are about which is not permitted.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement again. The question is about the partial wave of X. Each option shows the X's state with a letter. For example, option A shows X as p (l=1), B as s (l=0), C as f (l=3), D as s (l=0).

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking which partial wave (of X) is not permitted. So each option gives a different X state.

Wait, the process is NN (initial) → NN (final) + X.

So the X's orbital angular momentum is given by the letter (s, p, d, f, etc.), which correspond to l=0,1,2,3, etc.

So for each option, the X's orbital angular momentum is l. We need to determine if the process is allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the final NN state's L' must be odd, which is determined by the parity condition. So the parity condition requires that L' is odd. So for each option, the final NN state's L' is...

Wait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me clarify:

The options give the final NN state as something like 3D3. So the L' in the final state is D, which is L'=2. But earlier, from the parity condition, we have L' must be odd. So option C's L' is 2 (even), which would lead to parity not matching. So that process is not allowed.

Wait, but let's think again. The parity of the final system (NN + X) must be +1. The parity is the product of the NN's parity and X's parity.

The X has parity -1. The NN has parity (-1)^L'.

So (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1) = +1.

So L' +1 must be even → L' is odd.

So L' must be odd.

So for each option, the final NN state's L' must be odd. So let's look:

Option A: 7D1 → L'=2 (even) → not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L'=0 (even) → not allowed.

Option C:3D3 → L'=2 (even) → not allowed.

Option D:3P0 → L'=1 (odd) → allowed.

So in all options except D, the parity is violated. So the only allowed option is D.

Wait, but the question is asking which partial wave is NOT permitted. So A, B, and C are not permitted because they have even L'. Only D is allowed.

But looking at the options, all except D are forbidden.

Wait, but the question is which is not permitted. So the answer would be any option where the parity condition is violated.

But let's also check the angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum of the system must be zero.

The initial state has J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the final NN state and X must be zero. So the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero.

But J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN state: which is the combination of their spin (S') and orbital angular momentum (L'). So J_NN^2 = (S' + L')^2 = S'^2 + L'^2 + 2 S'·L'.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible J values for the NN state and X, and see if their sum can be zero.

Alternatively, for the total J to be zero, the individual J's must combine to zero. So J_NN and J_X must be such that their vector sum is zero.

Wait, but each of the options gives the NN state's J in the term symbol. So for example, in option A, the final NN state is 7D1, which has J=1. The X is in p state, which has l=1, so spin is... Wait, no, X is a particle, so it has its own spin, but in the term symbol, the orbital angular momentum is given. So X's total angular momentum is l (the orbital part) plus its spin. But wait, in the problem statement, X is emitted with some orbital angular momentum, but its spin isn't given. Hmm, perhaps that's beyond the scope, and we're assuming that the total angular momentum of X is purely orbital (but that's unlikely). Alternatively, perhaps we can ignore the spin of X for this problem, as the question is about the orbital angular momentum contributing to the partial wave.

Wait, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, the angular momentum of X is given by l, and the NN state has J. So the sum of X's angular momentum (l) and NN's J must be zero. But that's not possible unless both are zero, but X has l=1, etc.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Because the emission process involves the NN system emitting X, so the angular momentum of the NN after emission plus the angular momentum of X must sum to the initial angular momentum, which is zero.

Wait, but the initial angular momentum is zero. So the total after emission must also be zero.

So the sum of the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) and X (l_X) must be zero. But J_NN and l_X are vectors, so they must be equal and opposite in direction.

But J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN state, which is the sum of their orbital angular momentum (L') and their spin (S'). So J_NN = L' + S'.

Wait, but if the initial J is zero, then the sum of the NN's J and X's angular momentum must be zero. So J_NN + j_X = 0 → j_X = -J_NN.

But j_X is the angular momentum of X, which is the sum of its orbital (l_X) and spin (s_X) parts. But without knowing s_X, perhaps we can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider that the orbital angular momentum of the NN (L') and X (l_X) must combine to zero in the total system. But that's not directly applicable because the NN and X are separate particles, so their orbital angular momenta don't directly add in a simple way.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to the parity condition. We determined that options A, B, and C have final NN states with L' even, leading to parity -1, which violates the conservation. Only option D has L'=1 (odd), so parity is +1, which is allowed.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options give the X's state. So, in each option, the X has a certain l. The allowed cases are when the parity condition is satisfied.

So, the only permitted option is D (since it has L'=1, which is odd, leading to correct parity), and the others are not permitted.

But the question asks which partial wave is NOT permitted. So the answer would be any of A, B, or C. But looking at the options, all except D have even L', so are not allowed.

But the question provides four options and asks which is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the parity condition.

The initial parity is +1. The final parity is [parity of NN] * [parity of X]. NN's parity is (-1)^L', X's parity is -1. So:

[ (-1)^L' ] * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1). This must equal +1.

So (-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → which implies that (L' +1) is even → L' is odd.

Thus, L' must be odd. So in the options, which have final NN states with L' odd?

Looking at each option:

A) 7D1 → L'=2 (even) → parity would be (-1)^3 = -1 → not allowed.

B) 3S1 → L'=0 (even) → parity (-1)^1 = -1 → not allowed.

C) 3D3 → L'=2 (even) → parity (-1)^3 = -1 → not allowed.

D)3P0 → L'=1 (odd) → parity (-1)^2 = 1 → allowed.

So options A, B, and C are all not allowed because of parity violation. Option D is allowed.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be any of A, B, or C. But looking at the options, the question is about which one is not allowed, so the correct answer is any of the first three options.

Wait, but the options are four, and the question says which is not permitted. So the correct answer must be one of the options, implying that three are forbidden and one is allowed.

Looking back, the question says that the final NN state has T=0.

Earlier, we had the condition T = S + L' +1 mod 2. T=0, so 0 = S + L' +1 mod 2 → S + L' = 1 mod 2.

So S and L' must be of opposite parity. So if L' is odd (as in D), then S must be even. S can be 0 or 1 for two nucleons. So if S=0 (even), then L' must be odd, which matches D's case. So in D, S=0, L'=1 → S + L' =1 → even + odd = odd → 1 mod 2. So condition satisfied.

In the other options:

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 (since 2S+1=7 → S=3). L'=2. So S is odd, L' even → sum is odd + even = odd → 1 mod 2. So condition satisfied. But that doesn't affect the parity condition. But we already saw that the parity condition is violated in A, so it's forbidden despite satisfying the Pauli condition.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement says that Pauli requires T= S + L +1 mod 2. So for the final state, T is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2. So for each option, the final state's S and L must satisfy this.

Wait, but in option D: 3P0 → 3P0 implies (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P →1. So S=1, L=1.

S + L =1 +1 =2 → 0 mod2. Which would make T=0 +1 → T=1 mod2. But the condition is T=0. Wait, no, the condition is T= S + L +1 mod2. So 0 =1 +1 +1 mod2 → 3 mod2=1. So 0=1? That's not correct. So this would violate the condition.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's re-examine:

The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So in D, the final state is 3P0. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=1 (P). So S=1, L=1.

S+L=2 → 0 mod2. So 0 =0 +1 → 0=1? No. So this would make the condition 0 = (1+1+1) mod2 → 3 mod2=1 → 0=1 → which is not correct. Therefore, the condition is not satisfied in option D.

Wait, so this changes things. So the parity condition says L' must be odd, but the Pauli condition (T=0) requires S + L =1 mod2.

So for option D:

S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → 0 mod2. Which doesn't satisfy the condition S+L=1 mod2. So option D violates the Pauli condition.

But earlier, from parity, D was allowed, but from the Pauli condition, it's not allowed. Hmm.

So how to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol parsing.

In option D: 3P0 → the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So L is P → L=1. J is 0.

So S is (term is 3 → 2S+1=3 → S=1).

So S=1, L=1, J=0.

So S + L = 2 → 0 mod2. So 0 =0 +1 → 0=1? No. So T would be 0=1+1+1=3 mod2=1 → T=1, but the problem states T=0. So D's state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, but the final state must have T=0. So in D, T=1, which is not allowed. So despite parity being correct, the Pauli condition is violated.

So now, this complicates things. So let's reevaluate each option based on both conditions: parity and Pauli's condition.

Parity condition: L' must be odd.

Pauli condition: S + L' =1 mod2.

So for each option:

Option A: 7D1 → S=3, L'=2.

Parity: L'=2 even → parity (-1)^(2+1)=-1 → no.

Pauli: S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=5 → 1 mod2. So condition satisfied.

But parity is violated, so overall not allowed.

Option B:3S1 → S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1), L'=0.

Parity: L'=0 even → parity (-1)^(0+1)=-1 → no.

Pauli: S=1, L=0 → sum 1 → 1 mod2 → condition satisfied.

So parity no, Pauli yes → overall no.

Option C:3D3 → S=1, L'=2.

Parity: L'=2 even → parity (-1)^3=-1 → no.

Pauli: S=1, L=2 → sum 3 → 1 mod2 → condition satisfied.

So overall no.

Option D:3P0 → S=1, L'=1.

Parity: L'=1 → parity (-1)^(2)=1 → yes.

Pauli: S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2 → condition not satisfied (needs 1).

So parity yes, Pauli no → overall no.

Wait, this is confusing. So none of the options satisfy both parity and Pauli conditions.

But that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol parsing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the emitted X carries away some angular momentum, and the NN's state must combine with X's to conserve angular momentum.

Let me try a different approach. The initial state has J=0 and parity +1.

After emission, the final state is NN (with L' and S') and X (with l and s).

The total angular momentum must be J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN and X must be zero.

But this is a vector sum, which is complicated. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X (l) must be equal and opposite to the orbital angular momentum of the NN (L'), because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero.

Wait, that might not hold because the orbital angular momentum is part of the system's total angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X and the NN state must combine to zero.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of possible angular momentum coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X must be such that l = L'.

Because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the sum of X's l and NN's L' must be zero. So l = -L'.

But since L' and l are quantum numbers, they must have the same magnitude but opposite direction. So L' = l.

Wait, but quantum numbers are non-negative, so L' = l.

Thus, L' = l.

So in each option, the X's l must equal the NN's L'.

So let's see:

Option A: X is p (l=1). So NN's L' must be 1.

But option A's NN state is 7D1 → L'=2. So l=1 != 2 → this doesn't satisfy L'=l. So angular momentum not conserved → forbidden.

Option B: X is s (l=0). So NN's L' must be 0.

Option B's NN state is 3S1 → L'=0. So yes, l=0 == L'=0 → allowed.

But earlier parity condition says L'=0 (even) → parity (-1)^(0+1) = -1 → parity not conserved. So despite angular momentum being conserved, parity isn't. So this option is forbidden.

Option C: X is f → l=3. So NN's L' must be 3.

Option C's NN state is 3D3 → L'=2. So 2 !=3 → angular momentum not conserved → forbidden.

Option D: X is s → l=0. So NN's L' must be 0.

Option D's NN state is 3P0 → L'=1. So 1 !=0 → angular momentum not conserved. So this is forbidden.

Wait, but this approach says that only option B's angular momentum is conserved, but the parity is violated. So perhaps the correct approach is that L' must equal l.

In that case, the only option where L'=l is option B: X is s (l=0), and NN's L'=0. So that would satisfy angular momentum conservation.

But then, parity condition would require L'=0 (even) → parity (-1)^(0+1)=-1. Which doesn't match initial parity +1. So option B is forbidden.

Hmm, but this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is:

1. The parity condition requires L' to be odd.

2. The Pauli condition requires S + L' =1 mod2.

3. The angular momentum conservation requires that X's l equals L'.

So now, for each option:

L' must = l (from angular momentum conservation), and L' must be odd (from parity), and S + L' must be 1 mod2.

Looking at each option:

Option A: X is p → l=1 → L'=1 (odd). So parity condition is satisfied.

Now, S in the final NN state: term is 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3.

So S=3 (odd), L'=1 (odd).

S + L' =3+1=4 → 0 mod2. So Pauli condition requires 1 mod2 → condition not satisfied.

So option A is forbidden.

Option B: X is s → l=0 → L'=0 (even). Parity condition not satisfied. Forbidden.

Option C: X is f → l=3 → L'=3 (odd). Parity condition satisfied.

S in the final state: term is 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1.

So S=1 (odd), L'=3 (odd).

S + L' =4 → 0 mod2. Pauli condition requires 1 → condition not satisfied. So forbidden.

Option D: X is s → l=0 → L'=0 (even). Parity condition not satisfied. Forbidden.

So according to this, none of the options satisfy all three conditions. But that's impossible because the problem states that one is not permitted. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the angular momentum conservation isn't requiring L' = l, but rather that their vector sum is zero. But that's more complex and involves possible coupling, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular momentum condition is that the orbital angular momentum of X (l) must be zero. Because the initial state has L=0, and the final state must have the sum of orbital angular momenta (L' + l) zero, but that's not correct because they're separate particles.

Hmm. Maybe another approach is needed. Let's summarize:

We need to find which option violates either the Pauli condition, the parity condition, or the angular momentum condition.

But given that the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, and the options give various possibilities, I think the correct approach is to look for the option where the parity condition is violated, because that's a hard constraint.

From earlier, the only option that satisfies parity is D (L'=1). But D's Pauli condition isn't satisfied. So perhaps the primary constraint is parity.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer must be the one that violates either parity or the Pauli condition.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to focus on parity and the Pauli condition, ignoring angular momentum conservation if necessary.

So, for each option:

Option A: L'=2 (even) → parity no. So forbidden.

Option B: L'=0 (even) → parity no. Forbidden.

Option C: L'=2 (even) → parity no. Forbidden.

Option D: L'=1 (odd) → parity yes. But Pauli condition: S=1, L'=1 → sum 2 (0 mod2) → T= (1+1 +1) mod2= 3 mod2=1 → T=1, which doesn't match T=0. So D violates the Pauli condition.

So all options are forbidden. But that can't be right. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which has L'=2 (even) and thus parity no. But then I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to decide based on the previous analysis, which indicated that the only allowed option is D in terms of parity but not in terms of Pauli. But the question is about partial wave not permitted, likely because of parity.

So, the partial waves that are not permitted are A, B, and C, but the question only provides four options, and the answer should be one.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol parsing. Let me recheck.

Option A: 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3. L=D→2. J=1.

Option B:3S1 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L=S→0. J=1.

Option C:3D3 → S=1, L=D→2. J=3.

Option D:3P0 → S=1, L=P→1. J=0.

Now, the parity for each option's NN state:

A: (-1)^2 = 1.

X's parity: -1.

Total parity: 1 * (-1) = -1 → not allowed.

B: (-1)^0 =1.

X's parity: -1.

Total parity: -1 → not allowed.

C: (-1)^2=1.

X: -1.

Total: -1 → not allowed.

D: (-1)^1 =-1.

X: -1.

Total: (+1) → allowed.

So, the only option with correct parity is D.

But earlier, D's Pauli condition isn't satisfied. But perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Pauli condition in this context, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that T(NN) = S + L + 1 mod2. T is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

In option D: S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2. Doesn't satisfy.

So D violates the Pauli condition.

But the parity condition is satisfied.

So which is more important? The problem states that Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod2, so that condition must be satisfied. Thus, even if parity is correct, if the Pauli condition is violated, the process is forbidden.

So in this case, D violates the Pauli condition, so it's not allowed.

But then, all options are violating either parity or Pauli. But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition.

Wait, the condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, perhaps T is the isospin, which for nucleons (protons and neutrons), isospin is 1/2 for each nucleon. But for two nucleons, the total isospin can be T=0 or T=1.

Wait, but the problem states that the final state has T=0. So for that, the isospin must be 0.

But the Pauli condition given is T= S + L +1 mod2.

So for T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So in option D, S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2 → doesn't satisfy.

So option D is invalid.

Thus, the only option that satisfies both parity and Pauli conditions is none. But that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the initial state has T=0 as well, but the problem says that the final state has T=0. So perhaps the initial state's T is not relevant here.

But I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says that the process must satisfy both angular momentum and parity conservation, plus the Pauli condition.

So let's go through each option:

Option A: X is p (l=1). NN state is 7D1 (L'=2). So L' =2, X's l=1. So L' + l =3, which can't sum to zero. So angular momentum not conserved. Plus, L' even → parity invalid. So forbidden.

Option B: X is s (l=0). NN state is 3S1 (L'=0). So L'=0. X's l=0. So angular momentum conserved (0+0=0). Parity: L'=0 → (-1)^(0+1)=-1 → parity invalid. So forbidden.

Option C: X is f (l=3). NN state is3D3 (L'=2). So L'=2. X's l=3. So sum is 5→ can't be zero unless they're vectors canceling, but that's not possible with non-negative l. So angular momentum not conserved. Plus, L'=2 is even → parity invalid. So forbidden.

Option D: X is s (l=0). NN state is3P0 (L'=1). So L'=1, X's l=0. So sum is 1→ can't be zero. Angular momentum not conserved. Plus, Pauli condition not satisfied. So forbidden.

Wait, this suggests that all options are forbidden, but that's impossible. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternative approach: The parity of the NN state after emission must be (-1)^L'. The parity of the X is -1. So the total parity is (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L'+1). This must equal the initial parity of +1.

Thus, (-1)^(L' +1) = +1 → L' +1 even → L' odd.

So L' must be odd.

Looking at the options:

Only option D has L'=1 (odd). So it's the only parity-allowed option.

But in option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied. So perhaps the Pauli condition is secondary, and the parity condition is primary. Or perhaps the question only considers parity.

Alternatively, perhaps the Pauli condition is automatically satisfied if the parity condition is met.

Wait, let's check:

In option D, L'=1 (odd), X's l=0.

Pauli condition: T=0 = S + L' +1 mod2.

S in D is 1 (from 3P0 → 2S+1=3 → S=1).

So 0 =1 +1 +1 → 3 mod2=1 → 0=1. No. So not satisfied.

Thus, D is invalid.

But since all options are invalid, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emission, the final NN state has T=0.

The parity is conserved only if L' is odd.

So the only option with L' odd is D.

But D's Pauli condition isn't met, so it's forbidden.

Thus, all options are forbidden, but the problem says one is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me recheck:

Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

In D: T=0, S=1, L=1.

0 =1 +1 +1 → 3 mod2=1 → 0=1 → no.

Thus, D is not allowed.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the parity condition is D, but it violates the Pauli condition. So it's forbidden.

Thus, all options are forbidden, but the question must have an answer. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer would be the one that violates either parity or the Pauli condition.

But all options are violating either parity or Pauli, which is confusing.

But from the options, only D has L'=1 (odd) → correct parity. But it violates the Pauli condition. So perhaps the correct answer is D is allowed, but according to the conditions, it's not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that option C is not permitted because L'=2 (even) → parity no.

But I'm getting stuck, so I think the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T = 0 \), and the conditions \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), parity conservation, and angular momentum conservation must be satisfied. The goal is to determine which partial wave is not permitted.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:  
   The initial state is \( 1S0 \), which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The initial parity is \( (-1)^L = +1 \).

2. **Final State Conditions**:  
   - **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. The parity of the NN state is \( (-1)^{L'} \), and the parity of X is -1. Thus, the total parity is \( (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1) = (-1)^{L' + 1} \). For parity conservation, this must equal the initial parity \( +1 \), so \( (-1)^{L' + 1} = +1 \). This implies \( L' + 1 \) is even, meaning \( L' \) must be odd.
   - **Pauli Condition**: The isospin condition is \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Since \( T = 0 \), this simplifies to \( S + L = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Thus, \( S \) and \( L \) must have opposite parity (one even, one odd).
   - **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must remain zero. The orbital angular momentum of the NN state (\( L' \)) and the orbital angular momentum of X (\( l \)) must combine to conserve angular momentum.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:  
   Each option specifies the final NN state and the orbital angular momentum of X (\( l \)).

   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \), so \( S = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)), \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D \)).  
     - Parity: \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^2 = +1 \). Total parity = \( (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which violates parity conservation.  
     - Pauli Condition: \( S + L' = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is \( 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This satisfies the Pauli condition.  
     - Angular Momentum: \( L' = 2 \), \( l = 1 \) (from \( p \)). \( L' \neq l \), so angular momentum is not conserved.  
     - **Conclusion**: Violates parity conservation and angular momentum conservation. Not permitted.

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + s \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \), so \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L' = 0 \) (from \( S \)).  
     - Parity: \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^0 = +1 \). Total parity = \( (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which violates parity conservation.  
     - Pauli Condition: \( S + L' = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is \( 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This satisfies the Pauli condition.  
     - Angular Momentum: \( L' = 0 \), \( l = 0 \) (from \( s \)). \( L' = l \), so angular momentum is conserved.  
     - **Conclusion**: Violates parity conservation. Not permitted.

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), so \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D \)).  
     - Parity: \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^2 = +1 \). Total parity = \( (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which violates parity conservation.  
     - Pauli Condition: \( S + L' = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is \( 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This satisfies the Pauli condition.  
     - Angular Momentum: \( L' = 2 \), \( l = 3 \) (from \( f \)). \( L' \neq l \), so angular momentum is not conserved.  
     - **Conclusion**: Violates parity conservation and angular momentum conservation. Not permitted.

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L' = 1 \) (from \( P \)).  
     - Parity: \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^1 = -1 \). Total parity = \( (-1) \cdot (-1) = +1 \), which satisfies parity conservation.  
     - Pauli Condition: \( S + L' = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is \( 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This violates the Pauli condition.  
     - Angular Momentum: \( L' = 1 \), \( l = 0 \) (from \( s \)). \( L' \neq l \), so angular momentum is not conserved.  
     - **Conclusion**: Violates the Pauli condition and angular momentum conservation. Not permitted.

### Final Answer:
All options are forbidden due to violations of parity conservation, the Pauli condition, or angular momentum conservation. However, the problem specifies that one partial wave is not permitted. Based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most clearly forbidden due to both parity and angular momentum violations.

**Answer: C**
