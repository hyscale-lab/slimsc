Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities require the total to be 1. Oh wait, right, the square of the amplitudes' magnitudes should sum to 1.

So, let's compute the coefficients. The coefficients for |up> and |down> are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively. The normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the squares of their magnitudes.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So squared, it's 2. Similarly, the magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). Squared, that's 5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, no, wait. The question says |alpha> is proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but to make it a proper state, we must divide by sqrt(7). So yeah, the state is normalized as such.

Next, the operator whose matrix representation is given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what's the matrix look like? For a 2x2 system (since we have |up> and |down> as eigenstates), the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Hmm, so this looks like a spin operator maybe, but not the standard Sz operator. Wait, the standard spin matrices for Sx and Sy have off-diagonal elements, but not exactly like this. Let me think: the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But here our matrix is 0 on the diagonal, and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, so the operator is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). That operator is actually proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by ħ/2 gives our A matrix.

So, the eigenvalues of this matrix can be found. The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are ±1. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Therefore, the possible outcomes when measuring this operator are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, the operator's eigenstates are different from |up> and |down> because the operator is A. So the eigenstates of A would be a mix of |up> and |down>.

Alternatively, perhaps you can diagonalize operator A and find the corresponding eigenstates, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the state |alpha> and the operator A.

Wait, operator A is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|) = (ħ/2) (X), where X is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X. The eigenstates of X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. But since our operator A is (ħ/2) X, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, our state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). Let me write it as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

We can express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |+> and |->.

Expressed as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->

We need to find c_+ and c_- to find the probabilities.

So, substitute |+> and |-> into the equation.

Let me compute c_+ and c_-.

We have:

(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> = sqrt(7) [ c_+ |+> + c_- |-> ]

Substitute |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2):

(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> = sqrt(7) [ c_+ (|up> + |down>)/(sqrt(2)) ) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/(sqrt(2)) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= sqrt(7) * [ (c_+ + c_-) |up> + (c_+ - c_-) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

So, equating the coefficients on both sides:

Coefficient of |up>:
(1 + i) = sqrt(7) (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2)

Coefficient of |down>:
(2 - i) = sqrt(7) (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2)

We can denote:

Equation 1: (1+i) = sqrt(7) (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2)
Equation 2: (2 -i) = sqrt(7) (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2)

Let me denote sqrt(7)/sqrt(2) as a common factor.

Let me compute (c_+ + c_- ) and (c_+ - c_- )

Let me call A = c_+ + c_-
and B = c_+ - c_-

From Equations 1 and 2:

A = [ (1+i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
B = [ (2 - i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

So,

A = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
B = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding A and B:

A + B = (1 + i + 2 - i) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 * sqrt(2/7)
A + B = 2 c_+  (because A + B = (c_+ + c_-) + (c_+ - c_- ) ) = 2 c_+ 

So,
2 c_+ = 3 sqrt(2/7)
c_+ = (3 sqrt(2/7)) / 2

Similarly, subtracting B from A:

A - B = (1 + i - (2 - i)) * sqrt(2/7) = (1 +i -2 +i) * sqrt(2/7) = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7 )

But A - B = (c_+ + c_-) - (c_+ - c_- ) ) = 2 c_-

So,

2 c_- = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7)
c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find c_+ and c_- in terms of A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for c_+ and c_- from A and B.

We have:

A = c_+ + c_- = (1 + i) sqrt(2/7)
B = c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) sqrt(2/7)

Add A and B:

A + B = 2 c_+ = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ) ] sqrt(2/7) = 3 sqrt(2/7)
So c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) 

Subtract B from A:

A - B = 2 c_- = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ) ] sqrt(2/7) = ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2 

I think that's right.

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) 

So |c_+|² = (9/4) * (2/7) ) = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|²:

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

The magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2/7) ) ] / 4

So [ (1 +4 ) * (2/7) ) ] /4 = (5 * 2/7 ) /4 = (10/7)/4 = 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. But wait, the sum is 14/14=1, so that's correct.

But looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately. But let me compute the exact values.

Wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857... and 5/14 is 0.357142... So perhaps the options are rounded.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which is close. But let's check other parts.

Wait, the problem also asks for the average value of the operator. The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is an observable, the expectation value is the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Because the eigenstates are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, the expectation value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] (ħ/2) ) = (4/14) (ħ/2 ) = (2/7) * (ħ/2 ) = ħ/(7)

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7, which matches. So option A would have probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average ħ/7.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps the operator A is Hermitian, so the expectation value can be calculated directly using the state.

Let me compute <A> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * A matrix * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, the matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So,

< A > = (1/sqrt(7))^2 [ (1+i) (2 -i) * (ħ/2) + (2 -i)(1+i) * (ħ/2) ]

Wait, because when you multiply the row vector [a b] with matrix [[0 c],[c 0]], you get a*c + b*c = c (a + b). Hmm, wait no. Wait, matrix multiplication step by step.

Wait, the state vector is a column vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, to compute <A>, it's the conjugate transpose multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So, <A> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute each part:

First, compute A * |alpha>:

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So,

A |alpha> = [ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ;
              (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which is:

[ (ħ/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ;
  (ħ/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ]

Then, [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by this vector:

= (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out (ħ/2) * (1/sqrt(7))^2 = (ħ/2) * (1/7)

So,

= (ħ/14) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i)
= 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2
= 2 -i -2i -1
= (2-1) + (-3i)
= 1 -3i

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i)
= 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i^2
= 2 +2i +i -1
= (2-1) +3i
=1 +3i

Adding both terms:
(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 +0i = 2

So, <A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7

Same as before. So the average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

But wait, let me check the probabilities again. Earlier, I found |c_+|² =9/14≈0.6428 and |c_-|²=5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which seems to round these. So option A would have the correct probabilities and the average. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so its trace is zero, and the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the expectation value would be the average of these, weighted by probabilities.

Which is exactly what we did earlier.

But let me check the options again. Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That's matching.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients when expressed in the eigenbasis. So since |alpha> is in terms of |+> and |->, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the eigenstates of A, but about the operator itself. Wait, the question says: "Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." Hmm, the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->, so the probabilities are as I computed.

So, to recap, the probabilities are ≈64.28% and ≈35.71%, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36 when rounded. The average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. The magnitudes are \( |1+i| = \sqrt{2} \) and \( |2-i| = \sqrt{5} \), so the total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This corresponds to the matrix:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, which are \( |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \). Substituting the definitions of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
\]

By equating coefficients, we find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Rounding these to two decimal places, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To compute the average value of the operator \( A \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( A \) into this expression, we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
