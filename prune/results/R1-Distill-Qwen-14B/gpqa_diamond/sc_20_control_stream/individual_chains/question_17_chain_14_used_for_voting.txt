Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, indicates how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. 

So, the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is the form that's in solution, and we're to find out how much free Ca²+ ions are present. 

I think the formation constant (Kf) is given by the formula Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, since the complex is 1:1 (Ca²+ to EDTA^4-), the stoichiometry is straightforward. 

Wait, the problem says it's 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. 

In solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So, the dissociation reaction is: 
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4- 

The formation constant is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the formation reaction. The formation of the complex is: 
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA^2- 

So the formation constant Kf is equal to [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But in this problem, we have the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction. So the dissociation constant Kd would be the inverse of Kf. Because Kd = 1/Kf. 

So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Wait, but the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant. So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Now, assuming that the dissociation of the complex is minimal because Kd is very small (since Kf is very large), the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Let me denote [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. 

So, substituting into the expression for Kd: 
Kd = x^2 / [Ca-EDTA] 

We know [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. So, x^2 = Kd * [Ca-EDTA] 

Plugging in the numbers: x^2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 

Calculating that: 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-11 * 2e-2 = 4e-13. 

So x^2 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4)=2. sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13)= around 6.32e-7? Wait, let me calculate it properly. 

Because 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So, 2e-6.5 is equal to 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+ ions. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. 

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x²/(0.02) = 2e-11. 

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = (2e-2) * (2e-11) = 4e-13. 

So x is sqrt(4e-13) = √4 * √(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7=6.32e-7. Yes, that's correct. 

So option C is 6.3e-7, which matches. So the answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \). The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \):

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot [\text{Ca-EDTA}] = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Wait, the problem says it's 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. 

In solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So, the dissociation reaction is: 
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4- 

The formation constant is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the formation reaction. The formation of the complex is: 
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA^2- 

So the formation constant Kf is equal to [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But in this problem, we have the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction. So the dissociation constant Kd would be the inverse of Kf. Because Kd = 1/Kf. 

So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Wait, but the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant. So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Now, assuming that the dissociation of the complex is minimal because Kd is very small (since Kf is very large), the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Let me denote [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. 

So, substituting into the expression for Kd: 
Kd = x^2 / [Ca-EDTA] 

We know [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. So, x^2 = Kd * [Ca-EDTA] 

Plugging in the numbers: x^2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 

Calculating that: 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-11 * 2e-2 = 4e-13. 

So x^2 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4)=2. sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13)= around 6.32e-7? Wait, let me calculate it properly. 

Because 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So, 2e-6.5 is equal to 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+ ions. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. 

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x²/(0.02) = 2e-11. 

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = (2e-2) * (2e-11) = 4e-13. 

So x is sqrt(4e-13) = √4 * √(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7=6.32e-7. Yes, that's correct. 

So option C is 6.3e-7, which matches. So the answer should be C.
