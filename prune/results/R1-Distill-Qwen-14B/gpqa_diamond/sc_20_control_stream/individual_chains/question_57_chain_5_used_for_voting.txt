Okay, so I've got this problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, I remember that in scattering problems, especially in nuclear physics, phase shifts are involved in determining the scattering amplitude.

The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. They say to ignore the rest, so I guess I only consider these five phase shifts. The scattering is of 50 MeV electrons, but I'm not sure how the energy factors into this particular calculation. Maybe the energy is used to find the wavelength or something else, but let's see.

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. The formula is something like:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l + lθ) ]

But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh right, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l)) ]

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, I think the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of partial waves. Each partial wave l contributes a term, and the total amplitude is the sum of all these terms.

The form is:

f(θ) = 1/(2ik) * Σ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ]

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ] / (1 + ... ) Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ]

But wait, I think that's not exactly correct. I remember from my notes that the expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps each term is (2l + 1) times ( (e^{iδ_l} -1) / (2i) ) * ( (4π)/(k) ) something else? No, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what the question is asking. It's about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. That would be when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees, right? Because that's the direction of the incident beam.

So, the question is asking for Im[f(0)].

To find f(0), I can plug θ=0 into the expression for f(θ). Let me try to get the correct formula for f(θ) at θ=0.

Wait, another thought: I think the general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l + i cos δ_l sin lθ) ) ]

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = Σ ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) [ e^{iδ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ]

But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, I think that the real and imaginary parts of f(θ) are determined by the phase shifts δ_l. Let's try to think about this differently.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

But when θ is 0, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l). So, f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l )

Wait, but let's compute the imaginary part of f(0). So,

Im [ f(0) ] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Oh wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin δ_l, multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is simply (1/(2k)) Σ (2l + 1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me think about the expression for f(θ). The general form is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

So, at θ = 0, it's:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l )

We can write e^{iδ_l} as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So,

sin δ_l = 2 sin(δ_l/2) cos(δ_l/2)

But maybe that's not helpful here.

Let me compute Im[f(0)].

Im[f(0)] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ) ]

Expanding (cos δ + i sin δ) sin δ:

= cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ.

So, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

So, the entire sum is:

Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

Multiply by 1/(2ik):

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ] / (2ik )

Let me separate the real and imaginary parts.

Real part: [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2ik )

Imaginary part: [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2ik )

Wait, but 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k), since 1/i = -i.

So,

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ] * (-i)/(2k )

Multiply through:

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i) ) + Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-i^2) ) ] / (2k )

But i^2 is -1, so:

= [ -i Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ] / (2k )

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i. So,

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Because the second term is a real term, and the first term has a factor of -i.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The expression is:

f(0) = [ A + i B ] * (-i) / (2k )

Where A is the sum of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, and B is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So,

f(0) = [ (A + i B) * (-i) ] / (2k )

Multiply out:

(A)(-i) + (i B)(-i) = -i A + B (since i*(-i) is 1)

So,

f(0) = [ B - i A ] / (2k )

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is (-A) / (2k )

So,

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - ( Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Wait, but wait: No, because the expression is [ B - i A ] / (2k ), so the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k )

So,

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - ( Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Because when you multiply [ (2l+1)( cos δ sin δ + i sin² ) ] by (-i)/(2k ), the imaginary part comes from the (2l+1) sin² term multiplied by (-i^2) = 1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l(cosθ )

Wait, because sin(lθ + δ_l) can be expressed using trigonometric identities. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

But when θ=0,

sin(l*0 + δ_l) = sin(δ_l ) = 2 sin(δ_l/2) cos(δ_l/2 )

But maybe that's not helpful. Let me proceed.

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

But e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l 

= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

Separate into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l 

Imaginary part: (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l 

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). So,

The real part becomes: [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] * (-i)/(2k )

The imaginary part becomes: [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (-i)/(2k )

But wait, no, because when you have a real number multiplied by i, it becomes imaginary. So,

Let me compute each term:

The entire f(0) is:

(1/(2ik)) * [ Σ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ]

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

The 1/(2ik) is equal to -i/(2k). So,

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] * (-i/(2k)) + [ i Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should factor out the 1/(2ik):

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

Now, factor 1/(2ik) as (1/(2k)) * (1/i) = (1/(2k)) (-i) 

So,

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (-i/(2k) )

Multiply each term:

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i) ) + i Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (-i) ) ] / (2k )

Simplify each part:

The first term: -i * (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l

The second term: i * (-i) = 1, so it becomes Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l 

So,

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) (-i cos δ_l sin δ_l ) + Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

This can be written as:

= [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l - i Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So, the real part is [ Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k ), and the imaginary part is [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Thus, the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

But wait, when you take the imaginary part of a complex number, you take the coefficient of i. So, in the expression:

f(0) = (real part) + i (imaginary part)

Here, after the expansion, the imaginary part would be [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, no, because in the expression, it's [ ... - i ... ], so the coefficient of i is negative.

So,

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

But perhaps I have an error in the signs. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula for the imaginary part is [ Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternative Approach:

I think there's a formula that for the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0, it's given by the sum of (2l + 1) sin² δ_l divided by (2k). So,

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Another point: The differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but the question is about Im[f(θ)].

Wait, perhaps I can think about the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Specifically, the theorem says:

σ_total = 4π |k|^2 Im [ f(0) ]

But I'm not sure if that helps directly here, but it does connect the imaginary part of f(0) to the total cross-section.

But in any case, the problem requires me to compute Im[f(0)].

Let me proceed with the assumption that:

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Because that seems plausible. Now, I need to calculate this sum for the given phase shifts.

The given phase shifts are:

δ₀ = 90°, which is π/2 radians.

δ₁ = 67°, which is approximately 1.17 radians.

δ₂ = 55°, approximately 0.96 radians.

δ₃ = 30°, approximately 0.523 radians.

δ₄ = 13°, approximately 0.227 radians.

Wait, but since we're dealing with sine squared of the phase shifts, maybe we can compute their values numerically.

But first, let's compute each (2l + 1) sin² δ_l term.

l starts from 0 to 4 (since δ₀ to δ₄ are given).

So,

l=0: (2*0 +1) = 1. δ₀=90°, so sin(90°)=1. So, 1 * (1)^2 = 1.

l=1: (2*1 +1)=3. δ₁=67°. So, sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205. So, 3*(0.9205)^2 ≈ 3*(0.8473) ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: (2*2 +1)=5. δ₂=55°. sin(55) ≈ 0.8192. 5*(0.8192)^2 ≈5*(0.6710)≈3.355

l=3: (2*3 +1)=7. δ₃=30°, sin(30)=0.5. 7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4: (2*4 +1)=9. δ₄=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495. 9*(0.22495)^2 ≈9*(0.0506)≈0.4554.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 (l=0) + 2.5419 (l=1) +3.355 (l=2)+1.75 (l=3)+0.4554 (l=4)

Summing:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 +3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 +1.75=8.6469

8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

So, the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, Im [f(0)] = sum / (2k )

But what is k? k is the wave number. Since the electrons have energy 50 MeV, we can compute k.

Wait, the energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. Since electrons are charged particles, their kinetic energy is given, so we can find their momentum.

But since they're non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is a significant energy for electrons. Let me check: The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are significant.

The relation between energy and momentum for a relativistic particle is given by:

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

Where E is the total energy, p is the momentum, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

We can solve for p:

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)² ) / c

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. Let me work in natural units where c=1, so E (in MeV), m (in MeV/c²) becomes m c² in MeV.

So, m c² for electron is 0.511 MeV.

E = 50 MeV (since it's the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy? Hmm, wait, the problem says "50 MeV electrons", which usually refers to kinetic energy. But in high-energy physics, often the kinetic energy is considered as part of the total energy.

Wait, but if the electron is moving with kinetic energy K, then the total energy E is K + m c².

So E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c 

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, p = sqrt( E² - m² )

So,

p = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 )

≈ sqrt( (50.511)^2 ) = approximately 50.511 MeV/c.

Because (0.511)^2 is negligible compared to (50.511)^2.

So, p ≈ 50.511 MeV/c.

Now, the wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c)

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = p / (ħ c ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) )

Wait, because p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm, so when you divide (MeV/c) by (MeV·fm) ), the units become 1/(fm).

So,

k ≈ 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Now, back to the formula:

Im [f(0)] = sum / (2k ) 

sum is 9.1023 (dimensionless), and k is 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im [f(0)] = 9.1023 / (2 * 0.2561) fm⁻¹ * fm (since 1/k is fm )

Wait, because k is in fm⁻¹, 1/k is fm.

So,

Im [f(0)] = (9.1023) / (2 * 0.2561) fm 

Compute denominator: 2 *0.2561 = 0.5122.

So,

Im [f(0)] ≈ 9.1023 / 0.5122 ≈ 17.76 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the hundreds. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the options are 87163 fm (option A), 355.35 (B), 177.675 (C), and 251.271 (D).

Wait, my calculation gives about 17.76 fm, but none of the options are close to that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, the sum: 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1023.

That seems correct.

k calculation: p = 50.511 MeV/c. So,

k = p/(ħ c) = 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So, 2k is 0.5122 fm⁻¹.

So, 9.1023 divided by 0.5122 is approximately 17.76 fm.

But none of the options are near 17.76. The closest is option C, 177.675 fm. Which is exactly 10 times larger.

Hmm, where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps in the formula for the imaginary part. Maybe I forgot a factor of 10 or something else.

Let me re-examine the formula for Im[f(0)].

Earlier, I thought it was sum/(2k), but perhaps it's sum/(k), not sum/(2k).

Wait, let me go back to the expression:

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l - i Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So, the imaginary part is [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, but I previously thought the imaginary part was [ Σ sin² ] / (2k ), but perhaps I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for Im[f(0)] is [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

But in that case, with sum=9.1023, k=0.2561, 9.1023/(2*0.2561) ≈ 17.76 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me re-calculate the wave number k.

Wait, if the electrons are 50 MeV, is that kinetic energy or total energy?

If it's kinetic energy, then total energy E = 50 MeV + m c² = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But if the 50 MeV is the total energy, then E=50 MeV.

Wait, the question says "50 MeV electrons", which typically refers to kinetic energy, but sometimes it can be ambiguous.

Wait, let me recalculate p for E=50 MeV (total energy).

So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV/c ≈ ~50 MeV/c.

So,

k = p/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So,

sum is 9.1023.

Im [f(0)] = sum/(2k ) = 9.1023/(2*0.253) ≈ 9.1023/0.506 ≈ 17.98 fm.

Still around 18 fm. So again, the same issue.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again about the expression for Im [f(0)].

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is related to the optical theorem. The theorem says that the total cross-section is:

σ_total = 4 π |k|² Im [ f(0) ]

So, Im [f(0)] = σ_total / (4 π |k|² )

But without knowing σ_total, that doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im [f(0)] is different. Maybe it's the sum of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, divided by (2ik).

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the original expression for f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

So,

Im [f(0)] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ) ]

= Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ) ) ]

= Im [ (1/(2ik)) * (A + i B) ), where A=Σ (2l+1) cos δ sin δ, B=Σ (2l+1) sin² δ ]

So,

= Im [ (A + i B) * (1/(2ik)) ) ]

= Im [ (A/(2ik)) + (i B)/(2ik) ) ]

= Im [ (A/(2ik)) + B/(2k) ) ]

The first term, A/(2ik), is real? No, because A is real. So,

A/(2ik) = A/(2i k ) = (A i )/(2 k (-i^2)) )= (A i )/( 2 k ) * (-i²=1)

Wait no, more accurately,

A/(2ik) = (A) * (1/(2ik)) = A * ( -i )/(2k )

So,

= [ -i A ]/(2k )

The second term is B/(2k ), which is real.

So, the entire expression is [ -i A/(2k) ) + B/(2k) ]

The imaginary part comes from the coefficient of i. So,

Im [ f(0) ] = ( -A )/(2k )

So,

Im [f(0)] = [ - ( Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Wait, but in this case, the imaginary part is negative of the sum divided by 2k.

So, let's compute this sum.

Compute Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l for l=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. δ₀=90°, cos(90°)=0, so term is 1 * 0 * 1 =0.

l=1: 3. δ₁=67°. cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907. sin(67)≈0.9205. 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈3*(0.360)=1.08.

l=2:5. δ₂=55°. cos(55)≈0.5736, sin≈0.8192. 5 * 0.5736 *0.8192 ≈5*(0.470)=2.35.

l=3:7. δ₃=30°, cos=√3/2≈0.8660, sin=0.5. 7 * 0.8660 * 0.5 =7*(0.433)=3.031.

l=4:9. δ₄=13°, cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495. 9 *0.9744 *0.22495 ≈9*(0.219)=1.971.

Now, sum these:

l=0: 0

l=1: 1.08

l=2:2.35 → sum 3.43

l=3:3.031 → sum 6.461

l=4:1.971 → sum 8.432.

So, the sum is approximately 8.432.

Thus,

Im [f(0)] = [ -8.432 ] / (2k )

= -8.432/(2k ) 

But wait, k is 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im [f(0)] = -8.432/(2 * 0.2561) → -8.432/(0.5122)≈-16.45 fm.

But the options are positive. Also, the values are much lower than the options provided.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Another thought: Did I mix up the order of phase shifts? Because sometimes l starts from 0, but maybe the given phase shifts are for l=0,1,2,3,4. That's probably correct.

Wait, but in the formula used in the optical theorem, the imaginary part is positive. So perhaps the negative sign is an error.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So,

Im [f(0)] ≈16.45 fm.

But again, the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me recheck the calculation of k.

k = p/(ħ c )

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c → in natural units, p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 )

E=50 MeV (if 50 MeV is the total energy),

p = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )≈50 MeV/c.

So,

k=50 / (197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im [f(0)] using the other formula (sum of sin² terms) is sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2*0.253)=approx 17.86 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I used degrees. Oh wait, wait! Oh no, that's a critical mistake.

In the calculations above, I assumed the phase shifts are in degrees, but in reality, phase shifts are in radians. So, I must have made a mistake by using degrees instead of radians in the sine and cosine functions.

Ah! That's a big mistake. So, I need to convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing sine and cosine.

Let me recompute the sum for the first formula, where Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

So, δ₀=90 degrees → π/2 radians.

δ₁=67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

δ₂=55 degrees →0.95993 radians.

δ₃=30 degrees →0.523599 radians.

δ₄=13 degrees →0.226893 radians.

Now, compute sin(δ_l) for each:

l=0: sin(π/2)=1 → sin^2=1.

l=1: sin(1.16937)≈ sin(67°)=0.9205 → square is 0.8473.

l=2: sin(0.95993)=sin(55°)=0.8192 → square≈0.6710.

l=3: sin(0.523599)=sin(30°)=0.5 → square 0.25.

l=4: sin(0.226893)=sin(13°)≈0.22495 → square≈0.0506.

So,

summing (2l+1) * sin² δ_l:

l=0: 1 *1 →1.

l=1:3 * 0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Total sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Same as before.

Now, Im [f(0)] = sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2*(50/197.33)).

Wait, because E is 50 MeV (total energy), so p=50 MeV/c.

So,

k= p/(ħc) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So,

2k=0.506 fm^-1.

So,

Im [f(0)] =9.1023 / 0.506 ≈17.98 fm.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C: 177.675 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger.

Wait, but where could the factor of 10 come from? Maybe I messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given in a different way. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Wait, ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

p=50 MeV/c → 50 MeV/c =50/(c) MeV s/m.

Wait, no, in natural units where ħ=6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, c=3×10^8 m/s, but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, but I think I did the calculation correctly earlier.

Wait, let's compute k again.

p=50 MeV/c.

k=p/(ħ c )

But ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k is about 3.95 fm.

But in the formula, we're computing sum/(2k ), so 9.1023/(2 *0.253) ≈17.98 fm.

Wait, but the options are much larger. So, perhaps the formula is sum/(k ), not sum/(2k ).

Let me try that.

Im [f(0)] = sum/(k )

sum=9.1023, k=0.253 → 9.1023/0.253 ≈35.98 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Looking at the options, option B is 355.35 fm, which is 355.35. Hmm, 355 is about 10 times 35.98. So, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps in the energy calculation. Did I miss a factor of 10 in MeV to another unit?

Wait, the electrons' energy is 50 MeV, but perhaps when calculating k, I should consider that 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, but perhaps the conversion to momentum is different.

Wait, let me recompute k more carefully.

E = 50 MeV.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c

In SI units:

E = 50 MeV = 50 * 1.602e-13 J ≈8.01e-12 J.

m c² = 0.511 MeV =0.511 *1.602e-13 J≈8.18e-14 J.

So,

p = sqrt( (8.01e-12)^2 - (8.18e-14)^2 ) / (3e8 m/s )

≈sqrt( (6.416e-23) - (6.69e-27) ) / 3e8

≈sqrt(6.416e-23) /3e8 

≈8.01e-12 kg·m/s / 3e8 m/s 

≈ (8.01e-12) / (3e8 ) → approximately 2.67e-20 kg·m/s.

But we need k = p/ħ.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = p / ħ = (2.67e-20 ) / (1.0545718e-34 ) ≈2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Wait, that's a huge number. But 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

So, 2.53e14 m⁻¹ = 2.53e14 * (1e15 fm)^-1 = 2.53e14 / (1e15 ) fm⁻¹ = 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So, no error here.

Hmm, this suggests that the imaginary part is about 18 fm, but the options are much larger. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is sum (2l +1) sin δ_l, not sin squared.

Wait, let me think again. If the formula for Im [f(0)] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

Wait, for l=0: sin(90)=1 → term 1.

l=1: sin(67)=0.9205 → term 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192 →5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13)=0.22495 →9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

So, 13.382/(2*0.253)=13.382/(0.506)=26.45 fm.

Which is close to option D (251.271 fm), but not exactly.

Hmm, but I don't think that's the correct approach. Because the formula for the imaginary part involves sin^2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I used radians in the calculation. No, that's not the case because I corrected that earlier.

Another thought: Perhaps the energy is given in a different unit. Oh wait, the electrons are 50 MeV, but perhaps the correct way to compute the momentum is using relativistic equations.

Wait, another approach: The momentum p can be found using the relativistic relation:

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c² )^2

So,

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 )

So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ) / c² 

Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, E = gamma m c²,

p = gamma v m

But perhaps it's easier to compute p in terms of E and m.

So,

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )

So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c 

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, E was in MeV, m c² was 0.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈50 MeV.

Thus,

p = (50 MeV ) / (c^2 ) 

But wait, units are getting tricky here. Let me compute k in terms of inverse femtometers.

Because 1 fm⁻¹ is 1e15 m⁻¹.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just accept that the computed value is about 18 fm, but the options don't have this. So, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to find another angle.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is simply the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by ħ c/(2k ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given in terms of the phase shifts by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

At θ=0,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im [f(0)] = [Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, because e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So, the imaginary part is [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k )

Hmm, but earlier calculation gave sum=9.1023, k=0.253 → 9.1023/(2*0.253)≈17.98 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another Idea: The imaginary part is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im [f(0)] = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l 

But let's compute that.

Sum for l=0 to 4:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

So, sum=13.382.

Im [f(0)] = 13.382/(2*0.253) ≈13.382/0.506≈26.45 fm.

Hmm, option D is 251.271 fm, which is about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that phase shifts are in degrees. No, I converted them to radians earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated k.

Wait, perhaps the energy used is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me re-calculate p with E_kinetic=50 MeV.

The total energy E = K + m c^2 =50 +0.511 =50.511 MeV.

p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ) / c 

So, p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So,

k = p/(ħ c ) =50.511 MeV/(197.33 MeV·fm ) ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

So, same as before.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the formula for Im [f(0)] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, divided by k multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units.

The options are in fm.

The sum I'm calculating is dimensionless.

k is in fm⁻¹.

So, sum/(k ) → fm.

If my sum is 9.1023, and k=0.253 fm⁻¹,

Im [f(0)] =9.1023 /0.253 →≈35.98 fm.

Which is close to option B (355.35 fm), but a factor of 10 off.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the calculation of k?

Wait, let me recompute k.

E =50 MeV (assuming total energy), m =0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ c ) =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but if the sum is 9.1023,

Im [f(0)] = sum/(2k ) →9.1023/(2 *0.253)=17.98 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum/(k ), not sum/(2k )

So, 9.1023 / 0.253 =35.98 fm.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sum/(k ), which gives 35.98 fm, but the options are 355.35 fm. Which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of phase shifts.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the phase shifts given are in degrees, and in the formula, I should use the phase shifts in radians. Wait, no, I converted them earlier.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me recheck the given phase shifts.

Wait, the problem states: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So, five phase shifts.

Yes.

I think I've exhausted all options, and perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times the value I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k was wrong. Let me recompute k.

k = p/(ħ c )

p =50 MeV/c.

ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly 10 times 17.7675.

But why a factor of 10? I don't see where I could have missed that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the real part, but the options don't match either.

I think I've made a mistake in the formula for Im [f(0)].

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im [f(0)] = (1/(2k )) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l 

Which would give sum=13.382 divided by (2*0.253 )=13.382/(0.506)=26.45 fm.

Which is close to option D (251.271) but not matching.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the energy. Maybe the electrons are 500 MeV, not 50 MeV. But the question says 50 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rest mass energy in a different way.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the resources I've checked, I think the correct approach is that the imaginary part is sum/(2k ), which gives approximately 17.76 fm. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly 10 times 17.7675. Maybe I forgot a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, another Idea: Could the formula be (sum)/(k) * 10 ?

But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees, and I should have used them in degrees without converting to radians. Let me try that.

Compute sin(90)=1 → sin^2=1.

sin(67°)≈0.9205 → 3*(0.9205)^2≈2.5419.

sin(55)=0.8192 →5*(0.8192)^2≈3.355.

sin(30)=0.5 →7*(0.5)^2=1.75.

sin(13)=0.22495 →9*(0.22495)^2≈0.4554.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

Same as before.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 9.1023/(2*0.253)=17.98 fm.

Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum/(k ) * (1/(2)) → 17.98 fm.

No change.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct value should be around 18 fm, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times higher. Maybe the phase shifts were meant to be summed differently or there's a missing factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

But without further information, I'm unsure. Given the time I've spent, I think the best guess is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \) and \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is derived from the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / (\hbar c) \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert Phase Shifts to Radians**: The phase shifts are converted from degrees to radians:
   - \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \approx 1.169 \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \approx 0.959 \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \approx 0.524 \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \approx 0.227 \, \text{rad} \).

2. **Compute \( \sin^2(\delta_l) \)**: For each \( l \), \( \sin^2(\delta_l) \) is calculated:
   - \( l=0 \): \( \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.847 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.671 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.051 \).

3. **Sum the Terms**: The weighted sum \( \sum (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \) is computed:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot 0.847 \approx 2.541 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot 0.671 \approx 3.355 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot 0.051 \approx 0.459 \).
   - Total sum: \( 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.459 \approx 9.105 \).

4. **Calculate \( k \)**: The wave number \( k \) is determined using \( k = p / (\hbar c) \), where \( p = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} / c \). For \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) (total energy) and \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( p \approx 50 \, \text{MeV}/c \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), \( k \approx 50 / 197.33 \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \).

5. **Compute \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \)**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{\text{sum}}{2k} = \frac{9.105}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{9.105}{0.506} \approx 17.98 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 17.98 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \), which is exactly 10 times larger. A factor of 10 discrepancy suggests a possible oversight in the problem setup or interpretation, such as a missing factor in the energy or phase shift calculations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, I remember that in scattering problems, especially in nuclear physics, phase shifts are involved in determining the scattering amplitude.

The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. They say to ignore the rest, so I guess I only consider these five phase shifts. The scattering is of 50 MeV electrons, but I'm not sure how the energy factors into this particular calculation. Maybe the energy is used to find the wavelength or something else, but let's see.

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. The formula is something like:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l + lθ) ]

But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh right, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l)) ]

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, I think the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of partial waves. Each partial wave l contributes a term, and the total amplitude is the sum of all these terms.

The form is:

f(θ) = 1/(2ik) * Σ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ]

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ] / (1 + ... ) Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ]

But wait, I think that's not exactly correct. I remember from my notes that the expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps each term is (2l + 1) times ( (e^{iδ_l} -1) / (2i) ) * ( (4π)/(k) ) something else? No, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what the question is asking. It's about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. That would be when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees, right? Because that's the direction of the incident beam.

So, the question is asking for Im[f(0)].

To find f(0), I can plug θ=0 into the expression for f(θ). Let me try to get the correct formula for f(θ) at θ=0.

Wait, another thought: I think the general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l + i cos δ_l sin lθ) ) ]

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = Σ ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) [ e^{iδ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ]

But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, I think that the real and imaginary parts of f(θ) are determined by the phase shifts δ_l. Let's try to think about this differently.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

But when θ is 0, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l). So, f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l )

Wait, but let's compute the imaginary part of f(0). So,

Im [ f(0) ] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Oh wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin δ_l, multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is simply (1/(2k)) Σ (2l + 1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me think about the expression for f(θ). The general form is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

So, at θ = 0, it's:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l )

We can write e^{iδ_l} as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So,

sin δ_l = 2 sin(δ_l/2) cos(δ_l/2)

But maybe that's not helpful here.

Let me compute Im[f(0)].

Im[f(0)] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ) ]

Expanding (cos δ + i sin δ) sin δ:

= cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ.

So, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

So, the entire sum is:

Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

Multiply by 1/(2ik):

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ] / (2ik )

Let me separate the real and imaginary parts.

Real part: [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2ik )

Imaginary part: [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2ik )

Wait, but 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k), since 1/i = -i.

So,

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ] * (-i)/(2k )

Multiply through:

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i) ) + Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-i^2) ) ] / (2k )

But i^2 is -1, so:

= [ -i Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ] / (2k )

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i. So,

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Because the second term is a real term, and the first term has a factor of -i.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The expression is:

f(0) = [ A + i B ] * (-i) / (2k )

Where A is the sum of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, and B is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So,

f(0) = [ (A + i B) * (-i) ] / (2k )

Multiply out:

(A)(-i) + (i B)(-i) = -i A + B (since i*(-i) is 1)

So,

f(0) = [ B - i A ] / (2k )

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is (-A) / (2k )

So,

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - ( Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Wait, but wait: No, because the expression is [ B - i A ] / (2k ), so the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k )

So,

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - ( Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Because when you multiply [ (2l+1)( cos δ sin δ + i sin² ) ] by (-i)/(2k ), the imaginary part comes from the (2l+1) sin² term multiplied by (-i^2) = 1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l(cosθ )

Wait, because sin(lθ + δ_l) can be expressed using trigonometric identities. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

But when θ=0,

sin(l*0 + δ_l) = sin(δ_l ) = 2 sin(δ_l/2) cos(δ_l/2 )

But maybe that's not helpful. Let me proceed.

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

But e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l 

= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

Separate into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l 

Imaginary part: (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l 

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). So,

The real part becomes: [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] * (-i)/(2k )

The imaginary part becomes: [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (-i)/(2k )

But wait, no, because when you have a real number multiplied by i, it becomes imaginary. So,

Let me compute each term:

The entire f(0) is:

(1/(2ik)) * [ Σ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ]

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

The 1/(2ik) is equal to -i/(2k). So,

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] * (-i/(2k)) + [ i Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should factor out the 1/(2ik):

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

Now, factor 1/(2ik) as (1/(2k)) * (1/i) = (1/(2k)) (-i) 

So,

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (-i/(2k) )

Multiply each term:

= [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i) ) + i Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (-i) ) ] / (2k )

Simplify each part:

The first term: -i * (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l

The second term: i * (-i) = 1, so it becomes Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l 

So,

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) (-i cos δ_l sin δ_l ) + Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

This can be written as:

= [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l - i Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So, the real part is [ Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k ), and the imaginary part is [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Thus, the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

But wait, when you take the imaginary part of a complex number, you take the coefficient of i. So, in the expression:

f(0) = (real part) + i (imaginary part)

Here, after the expansion, the imaginary part would be [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, no, because in the expression, it's [ ... - i ... ], so the coefficient of i is negative.

So,

Im [ f(0) ] = [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

But perhaps I have an error in the signs. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula for the imaginary part is [ Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternative Approach:

I think there's a formula that for the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0, it's given by the sum of (2l + 1) sin² δ_l divided by (2k). So,

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Another point: The differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but the question is about Im[f(θ)].

Wait, perhaps I can think about the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Specifically, the theorem says:

σ_total = 4π |k|^2 Im [ f(0) ]

But I'm not sure if that helps directly here, but it does connect the imaginary part of f(0) to the total cross-section.

But in any case, the problem requires me to compute Im[f(0)].

Let me proceed with the assumption that:

Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Because that seems plausible. Now, I need to calculate this sum for the given phase shifts.

The given phase shifts are:

δ₀ = 90°, which is π/2 radians.

δ₁ = 67°, which is approximately 1.17 radians.

δ₂ = 55°, approximately 0.96 radians.

δ₃ = 30°, approximately 0.523 radians.

δ₄ = 13°, approximately 0.227 radians.

Wait, but since we're dealing with sine squared of the phase shifts, maybe we can compute their values numerically.

But first, let's compute each (2l + 1) sin² δ_l term.

l starts from 0 to 4 (since δ₀ to δ₄ are given).

So,

l=0: (2*0 +1) = 1. δ₀=90°, so sin(90°)=1. So, 1 * (1)^2 = 1.

l=1: (2*1 +1)=3. δ₁=67°. So, sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205. So, 3*(0.9205)^2 ≈ 3*(0.8473) ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: (2*2 +1)=5. δ₂=55°. sin(55) ≈ 0.8192. 5*(0.8192)^2 ≈5*(0.6710)≈3.355

l=3: (2*3 +1)=7. δ₃=30°, sin(30)=0.5. 7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4: (2*4 +1)=9. δ₄=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495. 9*(0.22495)^2 ≈9*(0.0506)≈0.4554.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 (l=0) + 2.5419 (l=1) +3.355 (l=2)+1.75 (l=3)+0.4554 (l=4)

Summing:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 +3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 +1.75=8.6469

8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

So, the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, Im [f(0)] = sum / (2k )

But what is k? k is the wave number. Since the electrons have energy 50 MeV, we can compute k.

Wait, the energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. Since electrons are charged particles, their kinetic energy is given, so we can find their momentum.

But since they're non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is a significant energy for electrons. Let me check: The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are significant.

The relation between energy and momentum for a relativistic particle is given by:

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

Where E is the total energy, p is the momentum, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

We can solve for p:

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)² ) / c

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. Let me work in natural units where c=1, so E (in MeV), m (in MeV/c²) becomes m c² in MeV.

So, m c² for electron is 0.511 MeV.

E = 50 MeV (since it's the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy? Hmm, wait, the problem says "50 MeV electrons", which usually refers to kinetic energy. But in high-energy physics, often the kinetic energy is considered as part of the total energy.

Wait, but if the electron is moving with kinetic energy K, then the total energy E is K + m c².

So E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c 

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, p = sqrt( E² - m² )

So,

p = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 )

≈ sqrt( (50.511)^2 ) = approximately 50.511 MeV/c.

Because (0.511)^2 is negligible compared to (50.511)^2.

So, p ≈ 50.511 MeV/c.

Now, the wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c)

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = p / (ħ c ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) )

Wait, because p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm, so when you divide (MeV/c) by (MeV·fm) ), the units become 1/(fm).

So,

k ≈ 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Now, back to the formula:

Im [f(0)] = sum / (2k ) 

sum is 9.1023 (dimensionless), and k is 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im [f(0)] = 9.1023 / (2 * 0.2561) fm⁻¹ * fm (since 1/k is fm )

Wait, because k is in fm⁻¹, 1/k is fm.

So,

Im [f(0)] = (9.1023) / (2 * 0.2561) fm 

Compute denominator: 2 *0.2561 = 0.5122.

So,

Im [f(0)] ≈ 9.1023 / 0.5122 ≈ 17.76 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the hundreds. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the options are 87163 fm (option A), 355.35 (B), 177.675 (C), and 251.271 (D).

Wait, my calculation gives about 17.76 fm, but none of the options are close to that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, the sum: 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1023.

That seems correct.

k calculation: p = 50.511 MeV/c. So,

k = p/(ħ c) = 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So, 2k is 0.5122 fm⁻¹.

So, 9.1023 divided by 0.5122 is approximately 17.76 fm.

But none of the options are near 17.76. The closest is option C, 177.675 fm. Which is exactly 10 times larger.

Hmm, where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps in the formula for the imaginary part. Maybe I forgot a factor of 10 or something else.

Let me re-examine the formula for Im[f(0)].

Earlier, I thought it was sum/(2k), but perhaps it's sum/(k), not sum/(2k).

Wait, let me go back to the expression:

f(0) = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l - i Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So, the imaginary part is [ - Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, but I previously thought the imaginary part was [ Σ sin² ] / (2k ), but perhaps I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for Im[f(0)] is [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

But in that case, with sum=9.1023, k=0.2561, 9.1023/(2*0.2561) ≈ 17.76 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me re-calculate the wave number k.

Wait, if the electrons are 50 MeV, is that kinetic energy or total energy?

If it's kinetic energy, then total energy E = 50 MeV + m c² = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But if the 50 MeV is the total energy, then E=50 MeV.

Wait, the question says "50 MeV electrons", which typically refers to kinetic energy, but sometimes it can be ambiguous.

Wait, let me recalculate p for E=50 MeV (total energy).

So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV/c ≈ ~50 MeV/c.

So,

k = p/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So,

sum is 9.1023.

Im [f(0)] = sum/(2k ) = 9.1023/(2*0.253) ≈ 9.1023/0.506 ≈ 17.98 fm.

Still around 18 fm. So again, the same issue.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again about the expression for Im [f(0)].

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is related to the optical theorem. The theorem says that the total cross-section is:

σ_total = 4 π |k|² Im [ f(0) ]

So, Im [f(0)] = σ_total / (4 π |k|² )

But without knowing σ_total, that doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im [f(0)] is different. Maybe it's the sum of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, divided by (2ik).

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the original expression for f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

So,

Im [f(0)] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ) ]

= Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ) ) ]

= Im [ (1/(2ik)) * (A + i B) ), where A=Σ (2l+1) cos δ sin δ, B=Σ (2l+1) sin² δ ]

So,

= Im [ (A + i B) * (1/(2ik)) ) ]

= Im [ (A/(2ik)) + (i B)/(2ik) ) ]

= Im [ (A/(2ik)) + B/(2k) ) ]

The first term, A/(2ik), is real? No, because A is real. So,

A/(2ik) = A/(2i k ) = (A i )/(2 k (-i^2)) )= (A i )/( 2 k ) * (-i²=1)

Wait no, more accurately,

A/(2ik) = (A) * (1/(2ik)) = A * ( -i )/(2k )

So,

= [ -i A ]/(2k )

The second term is B/(2k ), which is real.

So, the entire expression is [ -i A/(2k) ) + B/(2k) ]

The imaginary part comes from the coefficient of i. So,

Im [ f(0) ] = ( -A )/(2k )

So,

Im [f(0)] = [ - ( Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Wait, but in this case, the imaginary part is negative of the sum divided by 2k.

So, let's compute this sum.

Compute Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l for l=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. δ₀=90°, cos(90°)=0, so term is 1 * 0 * 1 =0.

l=1: 3. δ₁=67°. cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907. sin(67)≈0.9205. 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈3*(0.360)=1.08.

l=2:5. δ₂=55°. cos(55)≈0.5736, sin≈0.8192. 5 * 0.5736 *0.8192 ≈5*(0.470)=2.35.

l=3:7. δ₃=30°, cos=√3/2≈0.8660, sin=0.5. 7 * 0.8660 * 0.5 =7*(0.433)=3.031.

l=4:9. δ₄=13°, cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495. 9 *0.9744 *0.22495 ≈9*(0.219)=1.971.

Now, sum these:

l=0: 0

l=1: 1.08

l=2:2.35 → sum 3.43

l=3:3.031 → sum 6.461

l=4:1.971 → sum 8.432.

So, the sum is approximately 8.432.

Thus,

Im [f(0)] = [ -8.432 ] / (2k )

= -8.432/(2k ) 

But wait, k is 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im [f(0)] = -8.432/(2 * 0.2561) → -8.432/(0.5122)≈-16.45 fm.

But the options are positive. Also, the values are much lower than the options provided.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Another thought: Did I mix up the order of phase shifts? Because sometimes l starts from 0, but maybe the given phase shifts are for l=0,1,2,3,4. That's probably correct.

Wait, but in the formula used in the optical theorem, the imaginary part is positive. So perhaps the negative sign is an error.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So,

Im [f(0)] ≈16.45 fm.

But again, the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me recheck the calculation of k.

k = p/(ħ c )

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c → in natural units, p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 )

E=50 MeV (if 50 MeV is the total energy),

p = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )≈50 MeV/c.

So,

k=50 / (197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im [f(0)] using the other formula (sum of sin² terms) is sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2*0.253)=approx 17.86 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I used degrees. Oh wait, wait! Oh no, that's a critical mistake.

In the calculations above, I assumed the phase shifts are in degrees, but in reality, phase shifts are in radians. So, I must have made a mistake by using degrees instead of radians in the sine and cosine functions.

Ah! That's a big mistake. So, I need to convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing sine and cosine.

Let me recompute the sum for the first formula, where Im [f(0)] = [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

So, δ₀=90 degrees → π/2 radians.

δ₁=67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

δ₂=55 degrees →0.95993 radians.

δ₃=30 degrees →0.523599 radians.

δ₄=13 degrees →0.226893 radians.

Now, compute sin(δ_l) for each:

l=0: sin(π/2)=1 → sin^2=1.

l=1: sin(1.16937)≈ sin(67°)=0.9205 → square is 0.8473.

l=2: sin(0.95993)=sin(55°)=0.8192 → square≈0.6710.

l=3: sin(0.523599)=sin(30°)=0.5 → square 0.25.

l=4: sin(0.226893)=sin(13°)≈0.22495 → square≈0.0506.

So,

summing (2l+1) * sin² δ_l:

l=0: 1 *1 →1.

l=1:3 * 0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Total sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Same as before.

Now, Im [f(0)] = sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2*(50/197.33)).

Wait, because E is 50 MeV (total energy), so p=50 MeV/c.

So,

k= p/(ħc) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So,

2k=0.506 fm^-1.

So,

Im [f(0)] =9.1023 / 0.506 ≈17.98 fm.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C: 177.675 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger.

Wait, but where could the factor of 10 come from? Maybe I messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given in a different way. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Wait, ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

p=50 MeV/c → 50 MeV/c =50/(c) MeV s/m.

Wait, no, in natural units where ħ=6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, c=3×10^8 m/s, but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, but I think I did the calculation correctly earlier.

Wait, let's compute k again.

p=50 MeV/c.

k=p/(ħ c )

But ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k is about 3.95 fm.

But in the formula, we're computing sum/(2k ), so 9.1023/(2 *0.253) ≈17.98 fm.

Wait, but the options are much larger. So, perhaps the formula is sum/(k ), not sum/(2k ).

Let me try that.

Im [f(0)] = sum/(k )

sum=9.1023, k=0.253 → 9.1023/0.253 ≈35.98 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Looking at the options, option B is 355.35 fm, which is 355.35. Hmm, 355 is about 10 times 35.98. So, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps in the energy calculation. Did I miss a factor of 10 in MeV to another unit?

Wait, the electrons' energy is 50 MeV, but perhaps when calculating k, I should consider that 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, but perhaps the conversion to momentum is different.

Wait, let me recompute k more carefully.

E = 50 MeV.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c

In SI units:

E = 50 MeV = 50 * 1.602e-13 J ≈8.01e-12 J.

m c² = 0.511 MeV =0.511 *1.602e-13 J≈8.18e-14 J.

So,

p = sqrt( (8.01e-12)^2 - (8.18e-14)^2 ) / (3e8 m/s )

≈sqrt( (6.416e-23) - (6.69e-27) ) / 3e8

≈sqrt(6.416e-23) /3e8 

≈8.01e-12 kg·m/s / 3e8 m/s 

≈ (8.01e-12) / (3e8 ) → approximately 2.67e-20 kg·m/s.

But we need k = p/ħ.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = p / ħ = (2.67e-20 ) / (1.0545718e-34 ) ≈2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Wait, that's a huge number. But 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

So, 2.53e14 m⁻¹ = 2.53e14 * (1e15 fm)^-1 = 2.53e14 / (1e15 ) fm⁻¹ = 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So, no error here.

Hmm, this suggests that the imaginary part is about 18 fm, but the options are much larger. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is sum (2l +1) sin δ_l, not sin squared.

Wait, let me think again. If the formula for Im [f(0)] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

Wait, for l=0: sin(90)=1 → term 1.

l=1: sin(67)=0.9205 → term 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192 →5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13)=0.22495 →9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

So, 13.382/(2*0.253)=13.382/(0.506)=26.45 fm.

Which is close to option D (251.271 fm), but not exactly.

Hmm, but I don't think that's the correct approach. Because the formula for the imaginary part involves sin^2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I used radians in the calculation. No, that's not the case because I corrected that earlier.

Another thought: Perhaps the energy is given in a different unit. Oh wait, the electrons are 50 MeV, but perhaps the correct way to compute the momentum is using relativistic equations.

Wait, another approach: The momentum p can be found using the relativistic relation:

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c² )^2

So,

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 )

So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ) / c² 

Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, E = gamma m c²,

p = gamma v m

But perhaps it's easier to compute p in terms of E and m.

So,

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )

So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c 

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, E was in MeV, m c² was 0.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈50 MeV.

Thus,

p = (50 MeV ) / (c^2 ) 

But wait, units are getting tricky here. Let me compute k in terms of inverse femtometers.

Because 1 fm⁻¹ is 1e15 m⁻¹.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just accept that the computed value is about 18 fm, but the options don't have this. So, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to find another angle.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is simply the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by ħ c/(2k ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given in terms of the phase shifts by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

At θ=0,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im [f(0)] = [Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, because e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So, the imaginary part is [ Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k )

Hmm, but earlier calculation gave sum=9.1023, k=0.253 → 9.1023/(2*0.253)≈17.98 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another Idea: The imaginary part is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im [f(0)] = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l 

But let's compute that.

Sum for l=0 to 4:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

So, sum=13.382.

Im [f(0)] = 13.382/(2*0.253) ≈13.382/0.506≈26.45 fm.

Hmm, option D is 251.271 fm, which is about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that phase shifts are in degrees. No, I converted them to radians earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated k.

Wait, perhaps the energy used is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me re-calculate p with E_kinetic=50 MeV.

The total energy E = K + m c^2 =50 +0.511 =50.511 MeV.

p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ) / c 

So, p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So,

k = p/(ħ c ) =50.511 MeV/(197.33 MeV·fm ) ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

So, same as before.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the formula for Im [f(0)] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, divided by k multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units.

The options are in fm.

The sum I'm calculating is dimensionless.

k is in fm⁻¹.

So, sum/(k ) → fm.

If my sum is 9.1023, and k=0.253 fm⁻¹,

Im [f(0)] =9.1023 /0.253 →≈35.98 fm.

Which is close to option B (355.35 fm), but a factor of 10 off.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the calculation of k?

Wait, let me recompute k.

E =50 MeV (assuming total energy), m =0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ c ) =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but if the sum is 9.1023,

Im [f(0)] = sum/(2k ) →9.1023/(2 *0.253)=17.98 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum/(k ), not sum/(2k )

So, 9.1023 / 0.253 =35.98 fm.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sum/(k ), which gives 35.98 fm, but the options are 355.35 fm. Which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of phase shifts.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the phase shifts given are in degrees, and in the formula, I should use the phase shifts in radians. Wait, no, I converted them earlier.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me recheck the given phase shifts.

Wait, the problem states: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So, five phase shifts.

Yes.

I think I've exhausted all options, and perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times the value I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k was wrong. Let me recompute k.

k = p/(ħ c )

p =50 MeV/c.

ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly 10 times 17.7675.

But why a factor of 10? I don't see where I could have missed that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the real part, but the options don't match either.

I think I've made a mistake in the formula for Im [f(0)].

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im [f(0)] = (1/(2k )) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l 

Which would give sum=13.382 divided by (2*0.253 )=13.382/(0.506)=26.45 fm.

Which is close to option D (251.271) but not matching.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the energy. Maybe the electrons are 500 MeV, not 50 MeV. But the question says 50 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rest mass energy in a different way.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the resources I've checked, I think the correct approach is that the imaginary part is sum/(2k ), which gives approximately 17.76 fm. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly 10 times 17.7675. Maybe I forgot a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, another Idea: Could the formula be (sum)/(k) * 10 ?

But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees, and I should have used them in degrees without converting to radians. Let me try that.

Compute sin(90)=1 → sin^2=1.

sin(67°)≈0.9205 → 3*(0.9205)^2≈2.5419.

sin(55)=0.8192 →5*(0.8192)^2≈3.355.

sin(30)=0.5 →7*(0.5)^2=1.75.

sin(13)=0.22495 →9*(0.22495)^2≈0.4554.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

Same as before.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 9.1023/(2*0.253)=17.98 fm.

Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum/(k ) * (1/(2)) → 17.98 fm.

No change.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct value should be around 18 fm, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times higher. Maybe the phase shifts were meant to be summed differently or there's a missing factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

But without further information, I'm unsure. Given the time I've spent, I think the best guess is option C.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \) and \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is derived from the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / (\hbar c) \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert Phase Shifts to Radians**: The phase shifts are converted from degrees to radians:
   - \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \approx 1.169 \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \approx 0.959 \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \approx 0.524 \, \text{rad} \),
   - \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \approx 0.227 \, \text{rad} \).

2. **Compute \( \sin^2(\delta_l) \)**: For each \( l \), \( \sin^2(\delta_l) \) is calculated:
   - \( l=0 \): \( \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.847 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.671 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.051 \).

3. **Sum the Terms**: The weighted sum \( \sum (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \) is computed:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot 0.847 \approx 2.541 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot 0.671 \approx 3.355 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot 0.051 \approx 0.459 \).
   - Total sum: \( 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.459 \approx 9.105 \).

4. **Calculate \( k \)**: The wave number \( k \) is determined using \( k = p / (\hbar c) \), where \( p = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} / c \). For \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) (total energy) and \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( p \approx 50 \, \text{MeV}/c \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), \( k \approx 50 / 197.33 \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \).

5. **Compute \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \)**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{\text{sum}}{2k} = \frac{9.105}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{9.105}{0.506} \approx 17.98 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 17.98 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \), which is exactly 10 times larger. A factor of 10 discrepancy suggests a possible oversight in the problem setup or interpretation, such as a missing factor in the energy or phase shift calculations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
