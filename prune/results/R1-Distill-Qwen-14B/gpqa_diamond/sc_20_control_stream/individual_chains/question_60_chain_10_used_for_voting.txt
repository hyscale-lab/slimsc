Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my physics classes. Alright, the question is about an alien astronaut traveling at a high speed to Earth. I need to figure out how long the trip will take from their perspective.

So the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to the speed of light. I remember that when you get that close, special relativity effects like time dilation become significant. Time dilation is where time moves differently for the traveler compared to someone back on Earth.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 solar years. Wait, so from Earth's perspective, the astronaut has about 150 years to live. But the question is about the astronaut's own perception of time. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but the problem doesn't give that. Oh, wait, perhaps it's implied that it's the same as the distance we know. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So that's the distance the spaceship has to cover. But wait, no, the problem might not use that exact number. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance is such that from Earth's frame, the time is a certain value, and then we adjust for time dilation. Hmm, but the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, so I need to use the time dilation formula.

Time dilation in special relativity is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the spaceship is moving at v = 0.99999987c, very close to c. So v is almost c.

Let me calculate gamma. Let's compute v²/c² first. v is 0.99999987c, so v² = (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. 

Wait, 0.99999987 is approximately 1 - 1.3e-7. So squaring that is approximately (1 - 2*(1.3e-7)) because (a - b)^2 ≈ a² - 2ab when b is small. So 0.99999987^2 ≈ 0.99999974, but I'm not sure if this approximation is good enough. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it precisely.

Alternatively, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me think:

Let me compute 0.99999987². Let me call x = 0.99999987, so x = 1 - 1.3e-7.

x² = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so x² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - x² = 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7) ) = 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7).

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 10^-7. Taking the square root would give sqrt(2.6)*10^(-3.5). Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 10^(-3.5) is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is about 1964. That's a really big gamma, which makes sense because the speed is so close to c.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is the Earth time divided by gamma. Or wait, no: the proper time τ is equal to t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame. Alternatively, since the astronaut is in the rest frame of the spacecraft, the time experienced is the proper time.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how long the trip takes from Earth's perspective and then apply time dilation.

So, from Earth's perspective, the distance is D = 160,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So the time it takes, t_earth, is D/(v). Let me compute that.

t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Wait, since v is in terms of c, and D is in light-years, the time in years is D/(v) because light travels 1 ly per year. So I can compute 160,000 / approx 1.

Wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / (1 - 1.3e-7)) ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-7). Let me compute that: 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 * 1.3 * 1e-7 = 208,000 * 1e-7 = 2.08 * 1e-2 = 0.0208. So t_earth ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So approximately, t_earth is about 160,000 years. That's a long time! But from the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, their experienced time is less. 

The formula for the proper time τ (experienced by the astronaut) is τ = t_earth / gamma. Wait, no, wait. The proper time is the time measured in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame). So, actually, the proper time τ is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 1/gamma.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Time dilation formula is: t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) when t is the time in the Earth frame. So τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma. So τ = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is around 160,000 years. Gamma is about 1964. So τ ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ let's compute that.

160,000 divided by 1964. Let's see, 1964 * 81 is about 1964*80=157,120, plus 1964 is 159,084. So 81 years would be 159,084, which is just under 160k. 1964 * 81 = 1964 * (80 +1) = 157,120 + 1,964 = 159,084. So 81 * 1964 = 159,084. The difference between 160,000 and 159,084 is 916. So 916 /1964 ≈ 0.466. So 81.466 years. So approximately 81.5 years.

But wait, the options given are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years.

So option C is 81 years. But wait, the problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 81 = 103. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So they would live long enough to make the trip, right? So the answer can't be A. Unless something is wrong with my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculation because that's crucial.

v = 0.99999987c.

So v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ (approx) as I did before, 0.99999974 c².

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought 1 - v²/c² was 2.6e-7, which is correct (0.00000026). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961. So perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute 160,000 / 1961.

1961 * 81 is 1961 *80=156,880; 1961*1=1961 → total 158,841. The difference is 160,000 -158,841=1,159.

1,159 /1961 ≈ 0.591. So 81.591 years. So approximately 81.6 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So the options have C) as 81 years, so that's the closest.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the distance more accurately. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance, so perhaps I should approach this another way. Maybe the problem is intended to use the Earth's time in terms of the distance divided by speed, but perhaps I don't need to know the actual distance. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the distance as 163,000 light-years, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the approximation for time experienced under high speeds. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: The astronaut's experienced time is t' = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since v is so close to c, the time experienced is much shorter.

Another way: the distance is D, so from Earth's perspective, the time is t = D/(v). Then, the astronaut's time is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D/(v) * sqrt( (c² - v²)/c² ) ) = D/(v) * sqrt( (c² - v²) ) / c.

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of gamma. Because gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so t' = t / gamma.

Wait, but I'm getting the same as before.

So if the time from Earth is 160,000 years, and gamma is about 1961, then t' is about 81.5 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +81.5=103.5 years old upon arrival. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So they'd live long enough.

But looking at the options, option C is 81 years, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, another thing to consider: the actual distance. Wait, does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a certain distance? Because the problem doesn't specify. Maybe I should assume the distance is such that from Earth, the time is around 77 years or so. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the experienced time, which is a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake regarding the distance. Maybe the distance is 163,000 light-years, which would change the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 163,000/(1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7). Which is approximately 163,000 + 21.19 ≈ 163,021.19 years. Then, tau = 163,021.19 / gamma (1961) ≈ 163,021 / 1961 ≈ let's compute.

1961 * 83 = 1961*80=156,880; 1961*3=5,883. Total 162,763. The difference is 163,021 -162,763= 258. 258/1961 ≈ 0.131. So 83.13 years. So option C is 81, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says to approximate, so maybe the answer is approximately 81 years.

To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation due to the spacecraft traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Time Dilation Formula**:  
   The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, \( \tau \)) is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \)) by the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:  
   The spacecraft travels at \( v = 0.99999987c \). Squaring this gives:  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 \approx 0.99999974.
   \]  
   Then:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \approx \frac{1}{5.09 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961.
   \]

3. **Earth Frame Time (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \))**:  
   The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years. At a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), the time taken from Earth's perspective is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Astronaut's Experienced Time (\( \tau \))**:  
   Using the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they will be about 103 years old upon arrival. Given their average lifetime of 150 years, they will live long enough to reach Earth.

From the options provided:  
- **A)** Incorrect, as the astronaut will live long enough to reach Earth.  
- **B)** Incorrect, as the time is closer to 81 years than 72 years.  
- **C)** Correct, as the calculated time is approximately 81 years.  
- **D)** Incorrect, as 77 years is too low compared to the calculation.

Answer: C

Time dilation in special relativity is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the spaceship is moving at v = 0.99999987c, very close to c. So v is almost c.

Let me calculate gamma. Let's compute v²/c² first. v is 0.99999987c, so v² = (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. 

Wait, 0.99999987 is approximately 1 - 1.3e-7. So squaring that is approximately (1 - 2*(1.3e-7)) because (a - b)^2 ≈ a² - 2ab when b is small. So 0.99999987^2 ≈ 0.99999974, but I'm not sure if this approximation is good enough. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it precisely.

Alternatively, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me think:

Let me compute 0.99999987². Let me call x = 0.99999987, so x = 1 - 1.3e-7.

x² = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so x² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - x² = 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7) ) = 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7).

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 10^-7. Taking the square root would give sqrt(2.6)*10^(-3.5). Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 10^(-3.5) is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is about 1964. That's a really big gamma, which makes sense because the speed is so close to c.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is the Earth time divided by gamma. Or wait, no: the proper time τ is equal to t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame. Alternatively, since the astronaut is in the rest frame of the spacecraft, the time experienced is the proper time.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how long the trip takes from Earth's perspective and then apply time dilation.

So, from Earth's perspective, the distance is D = 160,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So the time it takes, t_earth, is D/(v). Let me compute that.

t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Wait, since v is in terms of c, and D is in light-years, the time in years is D/(v) because light travels 1 ly per year. So I can compute 160,000 / approx 1.

Wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / (1 - 1.3e-7)) ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-7). Let me compute that: 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 * 1.3 * 1e-7 = 208,000 * 1e-7 = 2.08 * 1e-2 = 0.0208. So t_earth ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So approximately, t_earth is about 160,000 years. That's a long time! But from the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, their experienced time is less. 

The formula for the proper time τ (experienced by the astronaut) is τ = t_earth / gamma. Wait, no, wait. The proper time is the time measured in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame). So, actually, the proper time τ is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 1/gamma.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Time dilation formula is: t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) when t is the time in the Earth frame. So τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma. So τ = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is around 160,000 years. Gamma is about 1964. So τ ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ let's compute that.

160,000 divided by 1964. Let's see, 1964 * 81 is about 1964*80=157,120, plus 1964 is 159,084. So 81 years would be 159,084, which is just under 160k. 1964 * 81 = 1964 * (80 +1) = 157,120 + 1,964 = 159,084. So 81 * 1964 = 159,084. The difference between 160,000 and 159,084 is 916. So 916 /1964 ≈ 0.466. So 81.466 years. So approximately 81.5 years.

But wait, the options given are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years.

So option C is 81 years. But wait, the problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 81 = 103. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So they would live long enough to make the trip, right? So the answer can't be A. Unless something is wrong with my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculation because that's crucial.

v = 0.99999987c.

So v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ (approx) as I did before, 0.99999974 c².

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought 1 - v²/c² was 2.6e-7, which is correct (0.00000026). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961. So perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute 160,000 / 1961.

1961 * 81 is 1961 *80=156,880; 1961*1=1961 → total 158,841. The difference is 160,000 -158,841=1,159.

1,159 /1961 ≈ 0.591. So 81.591 years. So approximately 81.6 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So the options have C) as 81 years, so that's the closest.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the distance more accurately. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance, so perhaps I should approach this another way.

Another way: the distance is D, so from Earth's perspective, the time is t = D/(v). Then, the astronaut's time is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D/(v) * sqrt( (c² - v²)/c² ) ) = D/(v) * sqrt( (c² - v²) ) / c.

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of gamma. Because gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so t' = t / gamma.

Wait, but I'm getting the same as before.

So if the time from Earth is 160,000 years, and gamma is about 1961, then t' is about 81.5 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +81.5=103.5 years old upon arrival. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So they'd live long enough.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake regarding the distance. Maybe the distance is 163,000 light-years, which would change the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 163,000/(1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7). Which is approximately 163,000 + 21.19 ≈ 163,021.19 years. Then, tau = 163,021.19 / gamma (1961) ≈ 163,021 / 1961 ≈ let's compute.

1961 * 83 = 1961*80=156,880; 1961*3=5,883. Total 162,763. The difference is 163,021 -162,763= 258. 258/1961 ≈ 0.131. So 83.13 years. So option C is 81, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says to approximate, so maybe the answer is approximately 81 years.

   Thus:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \approx \frac{1}{5.09 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961.
   \]

3. **Earth Frame Time (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \))**:  
   The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years. At a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), the time taken from Earth's perspective is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Astronaut's Experienced Time (\( \tau \))**:  
   Using the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they will be about 103 years old upon arrival. Given their average lifetime of 150 years, they will live long enough to reach Earth.

From the options provided:  
- **A)** Incorrect, as the astronaut will live long enough to reach Earth.  
- **B)** Incorrect, as the time is closer to 81 years than 72 years.  
- **C)** Correct, as the calculated time is approximately 81 years.  
- **D)** Incorrect, as 77 years is too low compared to the calculation.

Answer: C
