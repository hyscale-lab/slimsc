Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully again. The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product's structure.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what's the reaction when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid? Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. The mechanism usually involves the protonation of the oxygen, making a better leaving group, and then the ring opens. The nucleophile (like water) attacks the less substituted carbon in most cases, but wait, sometimes it's more about the stability of the transition state. Or maybe it's the carbocation that's formed. Wait, no, in acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation is more stable there. Or wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, so for epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions: the proton attacks the less substituted oxygen, which makes the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon because the adjacent carbocation would be more stable. Oh wait, no, maybe the nucleophile attacks the less substituted because the leaving group is a better one? I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think: in an epoxide, the two carbons are connected by an oxygen bridge. When you add acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then the ring opens, and the nucleophile (like water) attacks one of the carbons.

The regiochemistry of the attack is such that the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon because the transition state is more stabilized when the positive charge is on a more substituted carbon. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the carbocation stability. When the epoxide ring opens, a carbocation is formed. So if the more substituted carbon is more stable as a carbocation, the nucleophile will attack that carbon.

So for each epoxide, the ring-opening will lead to a diol. The configuration of the diol depends on the starting alkene's configuration and the reaction conditions.

Let me think about Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. When treated with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The (E) configuration means that the two substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. So, when the epoxide forms, it will have a certain stereochemistry. Then, when it's treated with acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which would form a different epoxide upon reaction with mCPBA. Then, this epoxide would also open under acidic conditions to form another diol.

Wait, but what is the outcome of each reaction in terms of the diol formed?

So, (E)-oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2 on either side in trans. When mCPBA adds, the epoxide forms with the two new oxygen bonds. The addition of mCPBA is stereospecific—so the epoxide retains the stereochemistry of the double bond. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen bonds on opposite sides. But wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a stereospecific manner, forming an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or wait, maybe the epoxide is formed with trans stereochemistry. Wait, no, the double bond is in the E configuration, so the substituents are opposite. When it becomes an epoxide, the two new oxygens are added across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry is retained. So the resulting epoxide is trans.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to draw the structures. Let's see:

(E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either end, but in E configuration, the substituents (like CH2CH3 groups on each end) are opposite. So when mCPBA adds, which adds across the double bond to form an epoxide, it does so in a way that the stereochemistry is retained. So the epoxide will have the two new oxygen groups on opposite sides. So the configuration of the starting alkene is E, so the epoxide is trans.

Then, when this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it undergoes ring-opening. The attack occurs at the more substituted carbon because the carbocation is more stabilized there. But wait, for oct-4-ene, each end is CH2CH2. So when the epoxide is trans, the ring-opening will result in a diol with a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide leads to the formation of a diol. The regiochemistry is determined by the attack of the nucleophile (water) on the more substituted carbon because the transition state is more stabilized when the positive charge is on the more substituted carbon.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on this part. Let me think about the mechanism again. The epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring then opens, with the electron-rich oxygen leaving as water. The adjacent carbons become positively polarized. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation-like transition state is more stable there.

So, for each epoxide, the attack occurs at the more substituted carbon, leading to diastereomers if the starting epoxide has different stereochemistry.

Wait, but for each starting (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, the epoxides are different. Let's consider each case.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide (trans) → ring-opening to diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide (cis) → ring-opening to diol.

So, when each epoxide opens, what diols are formed?

Wait, perhaps each epoxide would form a pair of diastereomers upon ring-opening. Let me consider the (E) case first.

In Reaction 1: the epoxide has two substituents (like CH2CH2 groups) on either end of the epoxide, but in a trans configuration. When the acid treatment occurs, the ring opens with water attacking the more substituted carbon (each end is equally substituted, so maybe it's symmetrical? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 in the middle? No, wait, octene is 8 carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2? No, let me count. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5.

Wait, maybe it's better to just represent it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond at position 4, so between C4 and C5.

When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide forms, creating an epoxide between C4 and C5, and the substituents on each side are on opposite sides (trans).

Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide between C4 and C5.

Then, upon treatment with aqueous acid, each epoxide opens to form a diol.

Now, the ring-opening of each epoxide would proceed with the nucleophile (water) attacking the more substituted carbon. In the case of the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene, each carbon of the epoxide is connected to two CH2 groups on either side. So each epoxide carbon is equally substituted, as both are connected to two CH2 groups. Therefore, when the ring opens, the attack can occur on either carbon, but since they're the same, the diol formed would be the same regardless of which carbon is attacked.

Wait, but wait, no, because the epoxide's stereochemistry affects the diastereomer formed during ring-opening.

Wait, let's think of each case:

Case 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide (trans) → ring-opening.

The epoxide has the O in a trans configuration. So when the ring opens, the attack occurs on the same face or the opposite?

Wait, no, I think the attack is on the same face because the ring opening leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side, but that depends on the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps it's better to visualize. For a trans epoxide, when the ring opens, the diol formed will have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the diol structure. Or wait, maybe not. I'm getting confused, perhaps I should think about the ring-opening in terms of the transition state.

Alternative approach: The epoxide can be either trans or cis, which affects how the ring opens.

In the case of a trans epoxide (from E-alkene), when it's opened under acidic conditions, the ring opens with the nucleophile attacking the more substituted carbon. But since both carbons in the epoxide are equally substituted (each is connected to two CH2 groups), the attack can be on either side. But because the epoxide is trans, the attack can lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to a pair of diastereomers upon ring-opening, but in some cases, they may be the same.

Wait, think about this: the epoxide is between C4 and C5, and each is connected to two CH2 groups. So when the ring opens, each carbon has the same substituents. So the diol formed will have two -OH groups on adjacent carbons. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol will form in a way that the two OH groups are either on the same side or opposite sides, depending on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed would be a single compound regardless of ring-opening direction. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

Wait, when the epoxide is trans, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So when the ring opens, the attack by water occurs on each carbon, leading to the diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol will have both OH groups on the same side or opposite sides.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model it. Let's imagine the epoxide as O connected to C4 and C5. In the trans case, the two oxygen bridges are on opposite sides. So each C (C4 and C5) has an O on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the attack can be from either side.

Wait, but let's think about the mechanism. The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring then starts to break, and the transition state allows for a partial positive charge on both carbons. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. But in this case, both carbons are equally substituted, so either will be attacked. But the stereochemistry of the epoxide will influence the diastereomer formed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the outcome. Each epoxide, upon treatment with aqueous acid, forms a diol. The diol can have different configurations based on the starting epoxide's stereochemistry.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans. Upon ring-opening, the diol formed will have the two OH groups anti to each other. Because when the epoxide is trans, the ring-opening leads to the OH groups on opposite sides. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the diol's stereochemistry depends on the epoxide's configuration. For a trans epoxide, the diol will have the OH groups on the same face, leading to a cis diol. Or wait, no, maybe the opposite.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try a different approach. Let's say you have a trans epoxide. The two oxygen groups are on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the nucleophile attacks one carbon, and the leaving group (protonated oxygen) leaves. The adjacent carbon becomes a carbocation, and the nucleophile attacks from the opposite side. Wait, no, perhaps the attack is from the same side because of the ring opening.

Alternatively, considering that the epoxide is a three-membered ring, when it opens, the nucleophile attacks the same face as the leaving group. So for a trans epoxide, the attack on each carbon would result in the diol hydroxyl groups being on the same side or opposite.

Wait, maybe I should think about a specific example. For example, consider trans-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, it opens to form a diol. The diol in this case would be a meso compound because the two OH groups are on opposite sides of the central two carbons.

Wait, no, wait. If the epoxide is trans, then the two OH groups would end up on the same side. Because the ring-opening leads to the OH groups being on adjacent carbons and on the same face.

Alternatively, let me think of the epoxide as a three-membered ring. Suppose the oxygen is in a trans configuration, so the two adjacent carbons each have a substituent (like CH2CH3) on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the nucleophile attacks one carbon from one face, and the leaving group departs from the same face. So the OH ends up on the same face as the attack.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of this as the attack happening from the same face, leading to the OH groups being on the same face. So for the trans epoxide, which has the substituents on opposite sides, the diol would have the OH groups on the same side, leading to a cis diol. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to two different diastereomers of the diol.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces two diastereomers. But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, maybe the diol formed is a single compound.

Wait, the starting material in Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene, leading to a trans epoxide. The epoxide is symmetrical because each end is a CH2 group. Therefore, when it opens, the diol formed will have two OH groups either on the same face or opposite.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the possible products. So, for Reaction 1, when (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, the epoxide is formed. Then, upon acid treatment, it forms a diol. Similarly, Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a different epoxide, which upon acid treatment forms another diol.

But what are these diols?

Wait, maybe each reaction produces a single diol because the epoxide is symmetrical and the ring-opening leads to only one possible product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the epoxide is unsymmetrical, you get two diastereomers, but in our case, the epoxide is symmetrical, so only one diol is formed.

Wait, oct-4-ene is a symmetrical molecule because each end of the double bond has the same substituents. So the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene would also be symmetrical. Therefore, when it undergoes ring-opening, perhaps only one diol is formed, which would be a racemic mixture if the attack leads to stereocenters.

Wait, but wait, the diol would have two adjacent stereocenters. For example, if the diol is HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, then the two OHs would be on adjacent carbons, each with two CH2 groups and one OH.

Wait, but the configuration of the diol would depend on the attack during ring-opening. If the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the diol can form in two different ways, leading to two stereoisomers.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then perhaps the diol can form as a single product. Because attacking either side of the epoxide would lead to the same product.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a pair of diastereomers upon ring-opening, but since the epoxide is symmetric, the diastereomers are the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the diol structure.

For the (E)-oct-4-ene epoxide, which is trans, when it opens, the two OH groups could be either on the same side or opposite sides. But because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed will have both OH groups either on the same side (leading to a cis diol) or on opposite sides (trans diol).

Wait, but for each epoxide, the ring-opening leads to a specific diol. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have a certain configuration, and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have a different configuration.

Now, but wait, each diol is a pair of enantiomers if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the diol is meso, then it may not have enantiomers.

Let me think: if the diol has two adjacent stereocenters, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it could be a meso compound. For example, consider HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. If the two OH groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral and would not show peaks on a chiral HPLC column.

Alternatively, if the OH groups are on the same side, then the diol would have two stereocenters that are not superimposable, making it a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, because the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 (E-ene) and Reaction 2 (Z-ene) are different. Let me think: if the epoxide is trans (from E-ene), then the diol formed would have the OH groups on the same side (cis), making it a meso compound. If the epoxide is cis (from Z-ene), the diol would have the OH groups on opposite sides (trans), but again, perhaps it's also a meso compound.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of a specific example. Take 2,3-epoxybutane (cis vs. trans), and see what diols are formed.

Wait, for cis-2,3-epoxybutane, when treated with acid, it would form a diol. The attack would occur on either carbon, but in a cis epoxide, the two OHs would end up on the same face. So, perhaps the diol is a trans-diol? Or maybe cis?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing myself. Let's approach this differently. Let's consider that each epoxide, upon ring-opening, forms a diol with two stereocenters.

If the epoxide is trans (from E-ene), then the diol would have the two OH groups on the same side, leading to a meso compound (if possible). Similarly, if the epoxide is cis (from Z-ene), the diol would have the OHs on opposite sides, which could be another meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting alkenes are each treated to form epoxides, which are then opened to form diols. Then, the chemist combines the products of both reactions and runs them on HPLC columns.

So each reaction (1 and 2) produces a diol. Let's say Reaction 1 gives Diol A, and Reaction 2 gives Diol B. Diols A and B could be different or the same, depending on their structures.

If Diol A and Diol B are the same, then combining them would just give one peak on both HPLC columns.

If they are different, then each would contribute to the chromatogram. Additionally, if either diol is chiral, it would show multiple peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but whether the diol is chiral depends on whether it has a plane of symmetry.

So, for each diol, let's consider:

- Diol from Reaction 1 (E-ene → trans epoxide → diol)
- Diol from Reaction 2 (Z-ene → cis epoxide → diol)

Each diol has two adjacent stereogenic centers. Let me consider if either of them is a meso compound.

For a meso compound, the molecule must have stereogenic centers but also a plane of symmetry. So, if the two OH groups are on opposite sides of the central two carbons, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

Alternatively, if the OHs are on the same side, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral, existing as a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, so let's model this.

Case 1: Diol from trans epoxide (Reaction 1). Suppose the diol has the OH groups on the same side (cis). Then, the molecule would have two adjacent stereocenters, each with an OH group. The molecule would be chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Therefore, it would exist as a pair of enantiomers (2 peaks on chiral HPLC).

Alternatively, if the diol has the OHs on opposite sides, it would be a meso compound (achiral, 1 peak on chiral HPLC).

Wait, but how does the epoxide's configuration affect the diol's configuration?

In the case of the trans epoxide (from E-ene), when the ring opens, the nucleophilic attack occurs on the same face for both carbons, leading to the OH groups on the same side. So the diol would have OHs on the same side, making it a chiral molecule with two stereocenters, no plane of symmetry. Hence, it would have enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the attack. If the epoxide is trans, the two oxygens are on opposite sides. Upon attack, the water would come in from the same face, leading to the OHs being on the same side.

No, wait, in the ring-opening, the epoxide oxygen is on one face. When the ring opens, the attack occurs from the same face, leading to the OHs on the same face.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about a specific example: trans-2,3-epoxybutane.

Upon acid treatment, it would form 2,3-butanediol. How?

The epoxide (trans) would open so that the OH groups are on the same face. So, the structure would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH3.

But wait, no, that's 2,3-butanediol. Wait, but is it cis or trans? The ring-opening of trans-2,3-epoxybutane would form a diol where the OHs are on the same side, making it a cis diol. Cis-2,3-butanediol is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry. So that diol would be achiral.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So, if the epoxide is trans, the diol formed is a meso compound (achiral). If the epoxide is cis, the diol formed is a pair of enantiomers (chiral).

Wait, that seems to make sense. Because the trans epoxide upon ring-opening would lead to a diol where the OHs are on opposite sides, making it a meso compound. But wait, earlier I thought that the trans epoxide would lead to a cis diol, but maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's imagine the trans-2,3-epoxide:

O
||
C2 – C3

In trans configuration, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So when the ring opens, the water attacks from the same face on each carbon. So the diol would have the OHs on the same side, making the diol a cis diol. But cis-2,3-butanediol is a meso compound because there's a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Thus, it's achiral.

Alternatively, if the epoxide is cis, the diol formed would have the OHs on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol. But wait, that can't be right because a trans diol would have the OHs on opposite sides, which might not be a meso compound.

Wait, no. Wait, if the epoxide is cis, the diol formed would have the OHs on opposite sides, making it the trans diol. For example, in cis-2,3-epoxide, the diol is trans-2,3-butanediol, which would be a chiral molecule, existing as two enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, trans-2,3-butanediol would have the OHs on opposite sides. But in that case, the molecule would have no plane of symmetry. Because if you look at it, each carbon has an OH, but on opposite sides. So the molecule would be chiral, not meso.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For 2,3-butanediol, if the OHs are on opposite sides (trans), does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

If you draw the molecule as HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2CH3, then if the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it a meso compound.

Wait, no, wait. If you have trans-2,3-butanediol, then each OH is on opposite sides. So, the configuration would be R and S on adjacent carbons, leading to a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think about the actual structure.

Imagine the molecule as follows:

CH2(OH)CH(OH)CH2CH3

But in trans configuration, the OH on C2 is up and the OH on C3 is down, or vice versa.

Wait, no, wait. For 2,3-butanediol, each OH is on a different carbon. If they are trans, the configuration would be R and S (or S and R) on adjacent carbons, leading to a meso compound because there's a plane of symmetry.

Ah, so whether the diol is cis or trans determines if it's a meso compound or not. So, the ring-opening of the epoxide leads to a diol that is either meso (if from trans epoxide) or non-meso (if from cis epoxide).

Wait, no, let me clarify: if the epoxide is trans, the diol formed is cis (meso), and if the epoxide is cis, the diol formed is trans (non-meso, thus chiral).

Wait, no, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Let's re-examine.

Epoxide configuration → diol configuration:

- Trans epoxide → diol with OHs on same face → cis diol → meso.
- Cis epoxide → diol with OHs on opposite faces → trans diol → (if structure is symmetric, it would be meso, but otherwise, it would be chiral).

Wait, but in the case of 2,3-butanediol, the trans diol is meso, and the cis diol is not. Because in cis diol, the two OHs are on the same face, so the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, in cis 2,3-butanediol, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it meso. So both cis and trans diols are meso?

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's think about 2,3-butanediol:

- If the diol is cis (OHs on the same face), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it a meso compound.

- If the diol is trans (OHs on opposite faces), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry as well, because each OH is on opposite sides. So both cis and trans diols are meso compounds. That can't be, because I know that 2,3-butanediol can be a meso compound, but whether the diol is chiral depends on how it's formed.

Wait, but no. Wait, 2,3-butanediol can be either a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers, depending on how it's formed. So if the diol is formed from a trans epoxide, you get the cis diol, which is meso. If the diol is formed from a cis epoxide, you get the trans diol, which is also meso.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up because I'm not certain about the ring-opening outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that each epoxide (cis and trans) leads to a diol that is a meso compound. That would mean that both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 give the same product, which is a meso diol.

But that can't be correct because the starting alkenes are E and Z, which would lead to different epoxide configurations and different diols.

Wait, another approach: think about the diol from each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → diol (cis configuration, meso).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → diol (trans configuration, meso).

Wait, but if both diols are meso, then each reaction produces the same meso diol, so combining them would give a single product, which would show as one peak on both HPLC columns. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diol. For example, the trans epoxide leads to a diol that is a meso compound, while the cis epoxide leads to a diol that is chiral.

Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the diol from the trans epoxide is a meso compound, while the diol from the cis epoxide is a chiral compound.

Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the diol structure. For each reaction, the diol has two adjacent stereogenic centers.

If the diol is meso, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. If it's not meso, it has chirality, meaning it exists as a pair of enantiomers.

So, for Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → diol. Let's say the diol ends up with OHs on the same face, making it a meso compound.

For Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → diol. The diol has OHs on opposite faces, which could be a non-meso diol, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the cis epoxide is a meso compound as well, which would mean both reactions produce the same product. But that doesn't align with the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think of each reaction's product.

- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA gives a trans epoxide. Acid treatment leads to a diol. If the diol is meso, then it's a single compound, achiral.

- Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA gives a cis epoxide. Acid treatment leads to a diol. If this diol is also meso, then both reactions give the same product.

But that can't be correct because the starting materials are different enantiomers, so their products should be different.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diol that is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but no, because the diols from each reaction would have different configurations, leading to different stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a meso diol, and Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol.

But I'm not certain. Let's try to think of the diol structure.

Assume that the diol from Reaction 1 is meso and the diol from Reaction 2 is chiral. Then, combining them would give two different diols, each of which may or may not be chiral.

Wait, but if Reaction 1's diol is meso (achiral), then it would appear as a single peak on both HPLC columns. Reaction 2's diol is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers, which would show as two peaks on a chiral column but a single peak on an achiral column.

Wait, but that would give a total of three peaks: one from Reaction 1 and two from Reaction 2. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks in total. But that depends on whether both diols are chiral.

Wait, let's think again: Reaction 1 produces a diol that is achiral (meso), and Reaction 2 produces a diol that is chiral (so two enantiomers).

Thus, when combining the products:

- The meso diol (from Reaction 1) would give a single peak on both HPLC columns.

- The chiral diol (from Reaction 2) would give two peaks on the chiral column and one peak on the achiral column.

So, when combined, the mixture would have:

On standard (achiral) HPLC: 1 (meso) + 1 (chiral as a single peak) = 2 peaks.

On chiral HPLC: 1 (meso) + 2 (chiral) = 3 peaks.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

Wait, but let me double-check. If Reaction 1's diol is meso (so 1 peak on both columns) and Reaction 2's diol is chiral (so 1 peak on standard, 2 on chiral), then the total peaks would be:

Standard HPLC: 1 (meso) + 1 (chiral as a single) = 2.

Chiral HPLC: 1 (meso) + 2 (chiral) = 3.

Which matches option B: 2 and 3.

But wait, another possibility is that Reaction 1's diol is chiral, leading to two enantiomers, and Reaction 2's diol is meso. That would give:

Standard HPLC: 1 (meso) + 1 (chiral as a single) = 2.

Chiral HPLC: 1 (meso) + 2 (chiral) = 3.

So same outcome as before.

Wait, but how do I know which reaction produces which?

In the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans. Upon acid treatment, the diol formed is a meso compound (so 1 peak on both HPLC).

For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis. Upon acid treatment, the diol formed is a chiral diol, which would have two enantiomers (so two peaks on chiral HPLC, one on standard).

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Let's consider that each reaction produces a diol that is a different stereoisomer.

If both diols are meso, then combining them gives one peak on both columns. If one is meso and the other is chiral, then standard HPLC shows two peaks (meso and chiral as single), and chiral HPLC shows three (meso as one, chiral as two).

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4 peaks in both → No, because if all products are achiral, it's possible, but unlikely.

B) 2 in standard, 3 in chiral → Yes, as per earlier reasoning.

C) 2 in both → Only if all products are achiral or same compounds.

D) 3 in standard, 4 in chiral → Unlikely, unless each reaction produces two chiral diastereomers.

Wait, but why would each reaction produce diols with different configurations?

Wait, perhaps both diols are chiral, leading to each having two enantiomers. So, combining them would give four enantiomers. But that would require that each diol is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks on a chiral column and two on standard.

Wait, but the options don't include that. The only option that fits the scenario where one diol is meso (1 peak) and the other is chiral (2 peaks) is option B, which would have 2 and 3 peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps both diols are chiral, each giving two enantiomers, leading to four peaks on chiral HPLC and two on standard.

But that would require that both diols are chiral, which isn't the case if one is meso.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of the products:

Each reaction produces a diol. Let's assume that Reaction 1's diol is meso, so 1 peak on both columns. Reaction 2's diol is chiral, giving two peaks on chiral column and one on standard. So when combined, the products would have two peaks on standard (1 meso + 1 chiral as single) and three on chiral (1 meso + 2 enantiomers).

So the answer would be option B: 2 and 3.

Looking back at the options:

Option B) 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

Yes, that fits.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, to form epoxides and then diols. The products are combined and analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene forms a **trans epoxide** due to the stereospecific addition of mCPBA.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the trans epoxide leads to a **cis diol**.  
   - The cis diol is a **meso compound** because it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.  
   - On standard HPLC (achiral), it appears as a single peak.  
   - On chiral HPLC, it also appears as a single peak because meso compounds do not separate into enantiomers.

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a **cis epoxide** due to the stereospecific addition of mCPBA.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the cis epoxide leads to a **trans diol**.  
   - The trans diol is **chiral** because it lacks a plane of symmetry.  
   - On standard HPLC (achiral), it appears as a single peak.  
   - On chiral HPLC, it separates into two peaks corresponding to the two enantiomers.

3. **Combining the Products**  
   - The combined product mixture contains:  
     - One meso diol (from Reaction 1).  
     - One chiral diol (from Reaction 2).  
   - On standard HPLC (achiral):  
     - The meso diol and the chiral diol each appear as a single peak.  
     - Total: **2 peaks**.  
   - On chiral HPLC:  
     - The meso diol appears as a single peak.  
     - The chiral diol separates into two peaks (enantiomers).  
     - Total: **3 peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks. This matches **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
