Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The question is asking how many of the given stars would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph has a high resolving power, but I'm not exactly sure about its exact specifications. I think it's used for measuring stellar velocities with great precision, maybe for exoplanet detection or something like that.

The question lists six stars, labeled a to f. Each star has certain parameters: some are bright stars like Canopus and Polaris, others are defined by their absolute magnitude and distance.

Wait, I should figure out the apparent magnitude of each star because the S/N ratio depends on the brightness of the object. The fainter the star (higher apparent magnitude), the lower the S/N, making it harder to detect.

So first, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (m) for each star that provides absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d). The formula for that is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

Let me go through each option:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Looking it up, I recall its apparent V magnitude is around -0.7. So that's definitely bright.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a well-known star, the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is about 1.98, so it's bright but not as much as Canopus.

c) Star with M=15 mag, distance 10 pc. So using the formula:
m = 15 + 5 log(10/10) = 15 + 5*0 =15. So apparent magnitude is 15. That's quite faint.

d) Same M=15, but distance is 200 pc. So m =15 +5 log(200/10) = 15 +5 log(20). Log(20)=~1.301, so 5*1.301≈6.505. So m≈15+6.505=21.505. That's even fainter.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. m=15 +5 log(5/10) = 15 +5 log(0.5). Log(0.5)= -0.301, so 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m=15-1.505=13.495. So about 13.5 magnitude.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. m=15 +5 log(50/10) =15+5 log(5). Log(5)=0.69897, so 5*0.699≈3.495. m=15+3.495=18.495. So about 18.5 magnitude.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) ~-0.7
b) ~1.98
c) 15
d) ~21.5
e) ~13.5
f) ~18.5

Now, I need to find which of these would yield a S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

I think the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity depends on the brightness of the target. I remember that the ESPRESSO has a certain limit for S/N per pixel. Wait, I should probably look up what the typical S/N per hour for different magnitudes would be.

But since I don't have the exact data, I need to reason. I think that for high-resolution spectroscopy, the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star.

The formula for the S/N ratio in an exposure is roughly S/N = (flux) * sqrt(t) / (noise), where noise is proportional to the square root of the readout time and dark current, but perhaps for this problem, we'll consider that the S/N per pixel is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m / 2.5), multiplied by sqrt(t), where t is the exposure time in seconds.

Wait, let me think about the relation between magnitude and flux. The flux received from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude. So for each magnitude, the flux drops by a factor of about 2.512 (since 10^(-0.4) ≈ 0.398, but wait, no, I think it's 10^(-0.4 * delta_m), so for each magnitude step, it's multiplied by 10^(-0.4) ≈ 0.398.

But for the S/N ratio, the signal is proportional to the flux, and the noise is proportional to the square root of the flux. Wait, no. Because for a given exposure time, the noise (like photon noise) is proportional to sqrt(flux). So S/N is flux / sqrt(flux) = sqrt(flux). So S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), which is proportional to 10^(-0.2 * m).

Wait, because flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), so sqrt(flux) is 10^(-0.2 m). So S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.2 m). But wait, that's per unit of time. Since exposure time is 1 hour, which is fixed, I guess.

So for a given star, the S/N per pixel depends on its apparent magnitude m. So I need to find at what m the S/N is 10.

But I need to know the formula for S/N as a function of m. Alternatively, I can think about what the typical S/N per hour per pixel is for a given magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the ESPRESSO's capabilities. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N ratios for bright stars, but for fainter stars, it's less effective.

Wait, I found (from my past knowledge) that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for bright stars (like K=0-5) in a few minutes. But for fainter stars, the S/N per pixel decreases.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the limiting magnitude for which the S/N is 10 in 1 hour.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the signal-to-noise ratio. Let me think. The S/N ratio for a star of magnitude m observed for an exposure time t is given by:

S/N = K * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t),

where K is a constant depending on the instrument, m0 is a reference magnitude, and t is the exposure time in seconds.

Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps I can find a rule of thumb. For instruments like ESPRESSO, which are high-resolution spectrographs, the S/N per pixel scales with the square root of the integration time and the flux.

Assuming that for a certain star, the S/N after 1 hour is 10. Let's say we need to find for each star whether their m would give S/N >=10.

Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO has a known limit. Let me think. I think that ESPRESSO can reach about S/N 10 for stars as faint as about magnitude 19 or 20 in one hour, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the limit is lower.

Wait, another approach:ESPRESSO's website says that it's designed to reach a S/N ratio of ~100 per pixel for bright stars (like m ~ 8) in a few minutes. For dimmer stars, it can collect enough photons, but the S/N per pixel decreases.

Wait, but in this problem, the exposure time is 1 hour, which is longer, so even fainter stars might reach S/N 10.

Wait, perhaps I can model it. Let's assume that the S/N per pixel for a star of apparent magnitude m is given by:

S/N = a * 10^(-0.4*(m - m_ref)) * sqrt(t),

where a is a constant, m_ref is a reference magnitude (like a bright star), and t is the exposure time in seconds.

But I need to find the value of a. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation using known data.

Wait, I found that the ESPRESSO spectrograph can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 10 per pixel for stars as faint as magnitude 19 in 10 minutes, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, but in this problem, the exposure time is 1 hour, so 6 times longer than 10 minutes. So the S/N would scale with sqrt(6). Let's see:

If for m=19, S/N=10 in 10 minutes, then in 60 minutes, the S/N would be 10 * sqrt(6) ≈24.5. So that's way more than 10.

Wait, but no, wait: S/N is proportional to sqrt(t). So if S/N is 10 in 10 minutes, then in 60 minutes (which is 6 times longer), S/N would be 10 * sqrt(6) ≈24.5.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, because S/N is proportional to the square root of the time. So if t increases by a factor of 6, the S/N increases by sqrt(6) (~2.45).

So for a given apparent magnitude, the S/N after 1 hour is 2.45 times higher than after 10 minutes.

But wait, perhaps the initial statement is about 10 minutes. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the limit for ESPRESSO is about apparent magnitude 20 for S/N=10 in 1 hour.

But without exact data, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO's S/N scales such that for each 5 magnitudes, the S/N halves. Or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps for each 2.5 magnitudes, the S/N decreases by a factor of 10. Because S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m * 2.5?) Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about it this way: for each magnitude, the S/N decreases by a factor of about 2.512^0.5 = sqrt(2.512) ≈1.58. Because S/N is sqrt(flux), and each magnitude is a factor of 2.512 in flux. So for each magnitude, the S/N is multiplied by approximately 1/sqrt(2.512) ≈0.61.

Wait, let me clarify. The flux (F) is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m). The S/N is proportional to sqrt(F), so S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.2 m).

So, for each increase of 5 magnitudes, the S/N decreases by a factor of 10^(-1) = 0.1, because 0.2 *5 =1.

So, if a star of magnitude m has S/N S, then a star of magnitude m+5 will have S/10.

Now, let's say that for a star of m=10, S/N is 100 in 1 hour. Then a star at m=15 would have S/N 10, m=20 S/N 1, etc.

Wait, but in our case, the exposure is 1 hour. So if m=10 gives S/N=100, m=15 gives 10, m=20 gives 1.

But the problem is to find which stars have S/N>=10. So any star with m<=15 would have S/N >=10.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the actual values. Let me try to find some examples.

Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO spectrograph has a limit of about m=20 for S/N=10 in 1 hour. If that's the case, then stars with m <=20 would have S/N>=10.

Looking back at the options:

a) m=-0.7 → definitely detectable.

b) m=1.98 → detectable.

c) m=15 → S/N=10? Because if m=15 and the limit is m=20, then yes, S/N would be 10.

d) m=21.5 → beyond the limit, S/N <10.

e) m=13.5 → within limit, detectable.

f) m=18.5 → within limit, detectable.

So stars a, b, c, e, f would be detectable (m <=20). Wait, but option d is m=21.5, so not detectable.

Wait, but how many stars are in each option?

Wait, the options are a to f. Each is a separate star.

Let me count how many are detectable:

a) yes.

b) yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → yes.

So stars a, b, c, e, f → 5 stars.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the stars listed below:

Wait, the question lists options a) to f), each a different star. The options for the answer are A) 2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

Wait, if I count 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) as detectable, that would be answer B)5, but wait, I thought that for m=15, S/N is 10. So, what is the actual limit?

Wait, perhaps the ESPRESSO's limit is higher. Let's assume that the limit is m=19. So, stars up to m=19 would have S/N >=10. Then, in our case:

a: yes

b: yes

c:15 → yes

e:13.5 → yes

f:18.5 → yes.

d:21.5 → no.

That's 5 stars, so answer B)5.

But wait, another possibility is that the limit is lower. Let's say the ESPRESSO can reach m=18 in 1 hour for S/N=10.

Then, d=21.5 (no), f=18.5 (no). So, only a, b, c, e would be detected: 4 stars, which would be option C)4.

But I'm not certain about the actual limit. Alternatively, maybe the limit is around m=19.

Wait, a more precise approach: Using the formula for S/N.

The formula for S/N per pixel is given by:

S/N = (K * (10^(-0.4 * (m - M0))) ) * sqrt(t),

where K is a constant, M0 is a reference magnitude, and t is the exposure time.

But without knowing K or M0, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate value.

Suppose that for a star of m=10, the S/N is 100 per pixel in 1 hour. Then, for each 5 magnitudes increase, S/N decreases by a factor of 10.

So:

m=10 → S/N=100

m=15 → S/N=10

m=20 → S/N=1

So, in this scenario, stars with m <=15 would have S/N >=10.

Looking at the stars:

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=1.98 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → no.

Wait, no. Because according to this, m=15 gives 10, m=16 would be 3.16, m=18.5 would be 1.778 (since each 5 mag is factor 10, 18.5-15=3.5 mag. So 3.5/5=0.7 → 10^(-0.7)= ~0.2. So S/N=10*(0.2) =2. So for m=18.5, S/N would be about 2, which is below 10.

Wait, no. Wait, we have S/N(m) = 100*(10^(-0.4*(m-10))) ) * sqrt(t/1hr).

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, let me think about the actual exposure time. 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So the S/N per pixel is proportional to the square root of the exposure time. But for a star that's faint, longer exposure helps but doesn't change the scaling with magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

S/N =  a * (10^(-0.4 * m)) * sqrt(t)

where a is some constant.

But without knowing a, perhaps I can find a relationship. Let's say that for a star of m=10, the S/N is 100 per pixel in 1 hour. Then,

100 = a * 10^(-4) * sqrt(3600)

Because m=10: 10^(-0.4*10)=10^(-4)=1e-4.

sqrt(3600)=60.

So,

100 = a * (1e-4) *60 → a=100/(60e-4) = 100/(0.006) ≈ 16666.666...

So a= ~1.666e4.

Then, for any star m, S/N=1.666e4 * 1e^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

Wait, but wait, I think I should model it as S/N = a * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is a reference magnitude.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate threshold. Let's suppose that for m=15, S/N is 10. Then, stars with m ≤15 can be detected.

So:

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=1.98 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → no.

So that's 4 stars. So answer D)3? Wait, no.

Wait, no, let me recount. a, b, c, e are detectable. So that's 4 stars.

Wait, wait:

a) yes.

b) yes.

c) yes.

e) yes.

f) no.

Wait, that's four. So the answer would be C)4.

But wait, I thought earlier that m=15 would be the limit. So including star c (m=15), e (13.5), a, b.

Wait, that's four stars: a, b, c, e. So 4 stars.

Then, the answer would be C)4.

But wait, wait. Let's recount:

Option a is Canopus, which is extremely bright. So yes.

Option b is Polaris, magnitude ~2. So yes.

Option c is m=15: yes.

Option d is m=21.5: no.

Option e is m=13.5: yes.

Option f is m=18.5: no.

So that's a, b, c, e → 4 stars. So the answer is C)4.

Wait, but another thought: the question says "at least 10 per binned pixel". What if the spectrograph's performance is such that only stars brighter than a certain magnitude can be detected? For example, if the limit is m=18, then stars a, b, c, e would be detectable (since e is 13.5, c=15, but f is 18.5, which is above 18, so not detectable). So 4 stars.

Alternatively, if the limit is m=20, then f would also be detectable (m=18.5 <20), making 5 stars.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. So perhaps the correct answer is C)4, considering that m=15 is the limit.

Wait, but earlier I saw that for m=10, S/N was 100; so for m=15, it's 10. So yes, c is detectable.

Thus, the detectable stars are a, b, c, e, f? Wait no, because earlier in the calculation, I thought that f's m=18.5 is above the limit if the limit is m=15.

Wait, no, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's re-express:

If the limit is m=15 (S/N=10), then stars with m<=15: a, b, c, e. Because e is 13.5, which is below 15. So that's four.

Wait, no, wait: c has m=15, e has m=13.5. Both are below or equal to 15. So four stars.

But earlier, when I thought the limit was m=15, I included a, b, c, e, f? Wait no, because f's m=18.5 is above 15, so it would not be detectable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all:

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=1.98 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → no.

So that's 4 stars: a, b, c, e. So four stars.

Thus, the correct answer would be C)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) of each star and compare it to the limiting magnitude for achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The apparent magnitude \( m \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10),
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The detectability of a star depends on its apparent magnitude, as fainter stars (higher \( m \)) yield lower S/N ratios.

### Calculations for Each Star:
1. **Star a (Canopus)**: Canopus is a bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This is far below the limiting magnitude, so it is detectable.
2. **Star b (Polaris)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 1.98 \). This is also below the limiting magnitude, so it is detectable.
3. **Star c**: \( M = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15.
   \]  
   This is at the limiting magnitude, so it is detectable.
4. **Star d**: \( M = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200/10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(20) = 15 + 5(1.301) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.
   \]  
   This is above the limiting magnitude, so it is not detectable.
5. **Star e**: \( M = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 15 + 5(-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.
   \]  
   This is below the limiting magnitude, so it is detectable.
6. **Star f**: \( M = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50/10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) = 15 + 5(0.699) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.
   \]  
   This is above the limiting magnitude, so it is not detectable.

### Detectable Stars:
- **Star a**: Detectable (\( m = -0.7 \)).
- **Star b**: Detectable (\( m = 1.98 \)).
- **Star c**: Detectable (\( m = 15 \)).
- **Star d**: Not detectable (\( m = 21.5 \)).
- **Star e**: Detectable (\( m = 13.5 \)).
- **Star f**: Not detectable (\( m = 18.5 \)).

### Conclusion:
A total of **4 stars** (a, b, c, e) are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the given conditions.

Answer: C
