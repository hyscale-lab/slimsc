Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet range, right? So, when these clouds absorb the light, they imprint this absorption line at 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, redshift comes into play because the universe is expanding. So, if the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, but we observe it at a longer wavelength due to redshift. But wait, the question is about the absorption. So, the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs some of it at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But because the cloud is at a higher redshift (z), the absorption line we observe would be shifted.

Wait, no. Wait, the quasar is behind the cloud. So, the light from the quasar, when it passes through the hydrogen cloud, gets absorbed at the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. So, if the cloud is at redshift z, the wavelength we observe the absorption line is lambda = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z). Because as the universe expands, the wavelength stretches, so the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted one.

But why does this matter for detection with optical telescopes? Oh right, because optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond a certain point. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to much of the UV, so ground-based optical telescopes can't see those wavelengths. So, for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha absorption is shifted into the optical.

Wait, what's the range of optical wavelengths? Visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So, the Lyman alpha absorption at 1216 Angstroms (which is about 121.6 nm, which is UV) needs to be redshifted into the optical. So, we need (1 + z) * 1216 > 4000 Angstroms or something? Wait, no, the visible is 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So, the observed wavelength after redshift would be 1216*(1+z) > 4000 Angstroms (so that it's visible), but wait, if it's bigger than 4000, then it's in the visible range.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. Let's compute (1 + z) * 1216 = observed wavelength.

If the observed wavelength is to be in the optical (i.e., above 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms), then:

1216 * (1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Solving for z:

(1+z) >= 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So, z >= 2.29.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that the absorption can be detected with optical telescopes. Because if z is too low, the observed wavelength would be in the UV, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see. So, the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical, perhaps at around 400 nm.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's rest frame. When we observe it, it's redshifted by (1+z). So, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

If the observed wavelength is in the optical, which starts at about 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), then:

1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

So, 1+z >= 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

Which gives z >= approximately 2.29.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just a bit higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So, 2.4 is the closest higher option.

But wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me compute 4000 / 1216 exactly.

4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 is about 1200. 4000 / 1200 is about 3.333. So, 4000/1216 is a little less than 3.333.

Let me compute 4000 / 1216:

1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000-3648=352.

352 / 1216 ≈ 0.289. So, 3.289. So, 1+z ≈ 3.289 → z≈2.289.

So, about 2.29. So, the lower limit is about z=2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest higher number is C) 2.4 and D) 1.9 is lower. So, the lower limit would be just over 2.29. So, the minimum redshift is about 2.29, so any z above that would have the Lyman alpha in optical.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift for detection. So, the object must have a redshift higher than 2.29. So, the lower limit is z=2.29. So, the minimal redshift is approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is the next higher option. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so that would not suffice.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something about the quasar's emission. Oh, wait. Quasars emit light across the spectrum, including the optical. So, the quasar's own light is what we see, but the absorption line is from the cloud in front. So, the quasar's light, which might be in the optical, but the cloud's absorption would cause a dip at a redshifted wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the clouds absorb the light at Lyman alpha, so the observed wavelength is longer. If the cloud is at a high enough redshift, the absorption line is in the optical. So, the lower limit is when that absorption line is just entering the optical.

So, the calculation seems right: z≈2.29.

But the options don't have 2.3. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So, 2.4 is the next possible option. So, the lower limit is around 2.29, so any object with z ≥2.29. So, the minimal z is approximately 2.3, so the lower limit would be 2.3, but the options give 2.4 as option C.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the Lyman limit, which is about 912 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. But wait, the question clearly states Lyman alpha at ~1216 Angstroms. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should consider the maximum wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can observe. Some of them can go into the near-infrared, which is up to about 1 or 2 microns (10,000 Angstroms). Oh, wait no, because the Lyman alpha line is in the UV, so the redshifted wavelength would need to be in the visible range.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So, the object's redshift must be at least such that the absorption line is in the optical. So, the minimal z is when the absorption line is at the start of the optical, which is about 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, but if the absorption is at 4000 Angstroms, which is 400 nm (blue light), that's the lower end of the optical. So, that's the minimal redshift. So, the minimal z is about 2.29.

But the options don't have 2.3. So, the next higher option is 2.4 (option C). However, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so would not be enough.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: is the Lyman alpha line in the quasar's frame or the cloud's frame? Oh, the cloud is absorbing the quasar's light. So, the cloud's rest frame is where the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, but the question is about the cloud's redshift.

Wait, no, the question says: the clouds are at some redshift, and they are absorbing the quasar's light. So, the quasar must be behind the cloud, meaning the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So, when the quasar's light is observed, the cloud's absorption is at a redshifted wavelength.

Wait, but the question is about the redshift of the object (probably the cloud) that allows detection. So, the cloud's redshift needs to be such that the absorption line is in the optical.

So, yes, the calculation holds.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the actual cutoff of optical telescopes. For example, some optical telescopes can observe up to maybe 900 nm (9000 Angstroms), but others might not go that far. So, perhaps for a more conservative estimate, the wavelength needs to be in the visible part where most optical telescopes can see.

Wait, if the wavelength is 5000 Angstroms (500 nm), green light, then:

(1+z) = 5000 / 1216 ≈ 4.099 → z ≈ 3.099, so z ≈3.1.

Which would require a higher redshift. But then the lower limit would be around 3.1, which would match option A (3) as the lower limit.

Wait, but why choose 5000 Angstroms? Because perhaps the question is considering that the light is in the visible spectrum. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the question again. It says, "estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?"

So, the absorption line must be in the optical range for the telescope to detect it. So, what is the minimum redshift that brings the Lyman alpha line into the optical.

If the observed wavelength must be greater than 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then:

1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000 → z >= (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

So, the minimal z is about 2.29. So, the lower limit would be just above 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher is 2.4 (option C) and the next is 1.9 (option D) which is too low.

Wait, but why would the lower limit be 2.4? Because the minimal z is 2.29, so any z above that is acceptable. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So, the minimal acceptable z is 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 2.3, which is below option C (2.4) and above option D (1.9). So, the correct answer should be the option just above 2.29, which is option C) 2.4, but the given options don't have 2.3. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for when the observed wavelength is in the near-infrared, but no, the question specifies optical telescopes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

4000 Angstroms is 400 nm. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So, (400 / 121.6) = 3.29.

So, (1 + z) = 3.29 → z=2.29.

So, any object with z >=2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical. So, the lower limit is z=2.29.

The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So, the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is about 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is higher.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So, the minimal acceptable z is 2.29. So, any z above that would allow detection. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.3. So, the correct answer is the option just above that. Since 2.4 is the closest, the answer is option C.

But wait, the options also include D)1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So, that's not acceptable because the absorption line would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't detect. So, the minimal redshift is around 2.3, so the correct answer must be option C (2.4).

Another thought: perhaps I should consider that the quasars themselves are at higher redshifts, but I think that's not relevant because the question is about the cloud's redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that some optical telescopes can't observe beyond certain wavelengths. For example, some have a cutoff in the near-infrared, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

So, to sum up, the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, which is closest to option C) 2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption (at ~1216 Å in the cloud's rest frame) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths between approximately 4000 Å (400 nm) and 7000 Å (700 nm). 

The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

where \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) and \( z \) is the redshift. To ensure the absorption line is in the optical range, we set:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \geq 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is not the minimal redshift.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than the calculated lower limit and would result in the absorption line being in the UV, undetectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than the calculated lower limit of 2.29 and is the closest valid option.
- **D) 1.9**: This is lower than the calculated lower limit and would also result in the absorption line being in the UV.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 2.4**, as it represents the smallest redshift value that ensures the Lyman alpha absorption line is within the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes.
