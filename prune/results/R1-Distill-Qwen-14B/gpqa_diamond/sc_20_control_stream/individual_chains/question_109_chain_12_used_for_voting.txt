Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2), where T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. The final state has T(NN) = 0. We need to determine which partial wave is not permitted among the given options.

First, I'll recall some basic concepts. The Pauli exclusion principle for identical particles says that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. For two nucleons (fermions), their combined wavefunction is a product of the spatial part, spin part, and isospin part. The overall symmetry must be antisymmetric.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given in (2S+1)L(J) notation. So 1S0 would mean:

- Total spin S = 0 (since 2S+1=1 → S=0).
- Orbital angular momentum L = 0 (since it's S).
- Total angular momentum J=0 (given as 0 in the term symbol).

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the final state NN must combine with X to form a total state that obeys the conservation laws and Pauli statistics.

The problem says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin of the two nucleons is 0. I think that the isospin part of the wavefunction would then be symmetric or antisymmetric based on the value of T. Wait, for two nucleons, each with isospin T3 = 1/2 (protons) or -1/2 (neutrons), but since they're emitting a particle, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the isospin part is symmetric if T is even and antisymmetric if T is odd? Hmm, I might need to think about that.

The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Let's see, if T is 0 (even), then 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even, meaning S + L must be odd. So S and L must be of opposite parity. So either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

Wait, S is the spin quantum number, which is 0, 1, etc. Similarly, L is 0,1,2,... For the final state NN.

The initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.

But after emission, the final NN state has some T, S, L. Wait, the problem says that the initial NN is 1S0, and they emit a particle X, so the final NN state is the result of this emission.

Wait, the initial state is the NN system. So when they emit X, the NN's state changes. So the initial state's isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum are S=0, L=0, T=?? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me think about the initial state's isospin. Since we're talking about two nucleons (protons and neutrons?), their isospin state can be either T=0 or T=1. But the initial state's T isn't given, so perhaps the process of emitting X affects this.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's isospin isn't the focus, but the final state's isospin is given as T=0.

Let me think about the conservation laws. The process must conserve both angular momentum and parity.

The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is L=0 (S state), the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the parity of the final state must include the parity of X. The parity of the system after emission is (parity of NN state) × (parity of X). So parity conservation implies that the parity before and after must be the same.

Wait, no. Because this is an emission process, maybe it's more about the parity of the entire system. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, when the NN system emits a particle X, the total parity before and after must be the same. The initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. L_initial is 0, so P_initial is 1.

The final state is the NN state plus X. The total parity is P_final = P_NN_final × P_X.

So because parity is conserved, P_initial = P_final. So 1 = P_NN_final × P_X. Since X has intrinsic parity -1, then P_NN_final must be -1.

So P_NN_final = (-1).

But the parity of the NN state is determined by their orbital angular momentum. Each NN state has parity (-1)^(L_NN). So (-1)^(L_NN) must equal -1. So (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd. So L_NN is odd.

Wait, but earlier from the Pauli condition, we have that S + L must be odd. Because T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S and L have opposite parity.

So L is odd, so S must be even. So S can be 0, 2, etc. But wait, spin can only be integer or half-integer. For two nucleons, the total spin S can be 0 (singlet), 1 (triplet). So S can be 0 or 1.

Wait, S=0 is even (0 is even), S=1 is odd (1 is odd). From the condition, S and L must have opposite parity. Since L is odd, S must be even. So S=0 is possible, S=1 would make S odd, which would make S and L same parity (both odd). So S=0.

So final NN state has S=0 and L odd.

So, T=0, S=0, L=odd (i.e., 1,3, ...).

Now, considering the angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0, and after emission, the NN system has J_NN, and X has some angular momentum. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_NN + J_X.

Wait, but the initial NN state has J_initial = 0. So the total angular momentum after emission is J_NN + J_X. So 0 = J_NN + J_X. Hmm, that can't be right because J_X is a non-negative integer, and J_NN is also non-negative. The only way this holds is if both J_NN and J_X are zero. Hmm, but that's not possible because X is a particle emitted, which likely has some angular momentum.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The initial state is the NN system in 1S0. When they emit X, the NN system's state changes, but perhaps the X carries away some angular momentum. So the initial total angular momentum of the system (which is just the NN system) is J_initial =0. After emission, the total angular momentum is J_NN + J_X. But since the system must conserve angular momentum, J_initial = J_NN + J_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_NN + J_X =0 → J_NN=0 and J_X=0. That would imply that the emitted particle X has J=0. But looking at the options, X can be p (a photon?), s (maybe spin 0?), etc. Wait, but in the problem, X is a particle of intrinsic parity -1. So perhaps it's a pion, which is a spin-0 particle. So X has J=0.

Wait, but in the options, the emitted particles are p, f, s, etc. Let me think: for example, p could be a photon (which is spin 1, but wait, that's not right. Photons are spin 1, but parity for a photon is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe p stands for something else. Alternatively, perhaps these are letters indicating the orbital angular momentum state of X. Wait, the problem says, "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So the options are like 7D1 + p, where p refers to the angular momentum state of X. Wait, but the problem says, "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum."

Wait, but in the options, after the arrow, it's something like 3D3 + f. So the 'f' here would be the angular momentum part of X? So for example, option D is 3P0 + s: the 's' would be the angular momentum state of X.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate the problem:

The initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L(J) = (1)S(0) → S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X, which has parity -1. So X's parity is -1.

After emission, the NN system is in a state with T=0.

We have to check each option to see which partial wave is not permitted.

Each option gives the final NN state and the type of X emitted. For each option, we need to check two things:

1. Whether the Pauli condition is satisfied (T= S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S and L have opposite parity).
2. Whether parity is conserved (P_initial = P_NN_final × P_X).

Additionally, angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is 0, so the sum of J_NN and J_X must be 0. But J_NN is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, and J_X is that of X.

Wait, but J_X could be the angular momentum carried away, so J_initial = J_NN + J_X. Since J_initial is 0, J_NN = -J_X. But angular momentum is a vector, and for this to happen, both must be zero. Because if J_X is non-zero, J_NN would have to be negative, which isn't possible since angular momentum is a non-negative integer (or half-integer). So the only possibility is J_NN = 0 and J_X =0.

Wait, but in that case, the final NN state must have J=0, which comes from their spin and orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but if the final NN state has J=0, that comes from adding their spin (S) and orbital angular momentum (L). Since the NN system's spin is S=0 (as determined earlier because S + L must be odd and L is odd, so S must be even (0 is even)).

So J_NN = |L - S| to L + S. Since S=0, J = L. So for J=0, L must be 0. But earlier, from the Pauli condition, we had L must be odd. So L=0 is even, which would make S=0 even → S + L=0, which is even, but the condition requires S + L =1 mod 2, which is odd. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that maybe my earlier conclusion is wrong. Let me retrace.

So, the initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emitting X, the final state NN has T=0.

Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2 → S and L must have opposite parity.

So if L is even, S must be odd, and vice versa.

But the parity of the final NN state is (-1)^L. Earlier, we found that the parity after must be P_NN = -1, because P_initial was 1, and P_X is -1 (so 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1).

So (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd. So L is odd.

So S must be even (since L is odd, S must be even because S + L is odd). S can be 0 or 2, but for two nucleons, the maximum spin is 1 (when triplet state). So S can be 0 only.

So S=0, L is odd.

But for the NN state, J = total angular momentum is given by J = L (since S=0). So J = L, which is odd.

But the initial total angular momentum is 0, so the sum of the NN's J and X's J must be 0. But J_NN is L=odd, which is at least 1. So J_X would have to be negative, which isn't possible because angular momentum is a non-negative integer. So the only way this works is if J_NN =0 and J_X=0. But J_NN is L, which is odd. Which would mean L=0, but that's even. Contradiction.

Hmm, this is confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the orbital angular momentum of X is separate from the NN system's. So the total angular momentum J_initial (which is 0) must equal the total J after emission, which would be J_NN + J_X. But J_NN is the angular momentum of the NN system, and J_X is the angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, but J_initial is 0, so J_NN + J_X = 0. But J_NN and J_X are both non-negative integers or half-integers. The only way this holds is if both J_NN and J_X are zero. So J_NN =0, J_X=0.

But J_NN is determined by the NN's spin and orbital angular momentum. Since the NN's spin S is 0 (as we found earlier), J_NN = L. So L must be zero. But earlier, we found that L must be odd because P_NN = (-1)^L = -1 → L is odd. So that's a conflict.

Wait, this suggests that there's a problem with the assumption that J_initial is 0. But the initial state is J=0, so how can the final state have J_NN + J_X =0? The only possibility is J_NN=0 and J_X=0.

So J_NN=0 → L=0 (since S=0). But then, for parity, P_NN = (-1)^0 = 1. Then P_initial = 1 = P_NN × P_X → 1 = 1 × (-1) → 1 = -1. That's not possible.

So this suggests that no such emission is possible. But the problem states that particle X is emitted, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the parity differently. The parity of the initial state is 1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. So 1 = (P_NN) × (P_X). Since P_X is -1, then P_NN must be -1, so P_NN = -1.

So, P_NN = (-1)^L = -1 → L is odd.

So, L is odd, which implies that the NN's orbital angular momentum is odd (1,3,5...). But then, J_NN is determined by L and S. Since S=0, J_NN = L (since S=0, J = L).

So J_NN is L, which is odd. So J_NN is 1,3,5 etc. But the initial J is 0, so J_initial = J_NN + J_X → 0 = J_NN + J_X. But J_NN is 1, so J_X must be -1, which is impossible because angular momentum can't be negative. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, this implies that the process is impossible. But the question says that such a process is possible and asks which partial wave is not permitted. So I must be making a mistake in how I'm considering the angular momentum.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the total angular momentum includes both the NN system and the emitted X. But their sum must equal the initial J=0. So J_NN + J_X =0. Which can only happen if both J_NN and J_X are zero.

But then, J_NN=0 → L=0 (since S=0). But L=0 would make P_NN =1, leading to 1 = 1 × (-1) → 1=-1. Which isn't possible.

This suggests that no emission is possible, but the problem says that X is emitted. So I must be approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity is not the only factor. Let me think differently.

The parity of the initial state is 1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. So P_initial = P_NN * P_X.

So 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So the NN's parity is -1, which implies that their orbital angular momentum L is odd.

So L must be 1,3,5 etc.

Now, the spin S of the NN state is 0 or 1. But from the Pauli condition, T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2. Since L is odd (1,3,5...), and S can be 0 or 1.

If L is odd, and S must be even, because S + L must be odd → if L is odd, S must be even. So S can be 0.

So S=0, L is odd.

Thus, the NN's J is L (since S=0), so J=1,3,5 etc.

But the initial J is 0, so J_NN + J_X =0 → J_X = -J_NN. Which is impossible because J can't be negative. Therefore, this process can't happen.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Pauli condition. Let me re-examine the Pauli condition.

The problem says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Given that T=0, we have 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2 → S and L must have opposite parity.

Earlier, I thought that if L is odd, S must be even, which for nucleons would mean S=0.

So, with S=0, L must be odd.

But then, J_NN = L (since S=0), so J_NN is odd.

But J_initial is 0, so J_NN + J_X =0 → J_X must be negative, which is impossible.

So, perhaps the only way this works is if J_NN and J_X are both zero. But that would require L=0 and S=0, which gives T=0 =0+0+1 mod 2 → 0=1 mod2 → which is false. So that's not possible.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: Let's look at each option and check whether the conditions are met.

Each option gives the initial state, the final NN state, and the type of X emitted.

The initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final NN state is, for example, in option A:7D1.

So the final NN state would have (2S+1)L'(J'). So 7D1 would be S=3 (since 2S+1=7 → S=3), L'=2 (since D is L=2), and J' = L' + S = 2 +3=5, but perhaps it's a term symbol, so J could be 1? Wait, no, the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J), so 7D1 would mean S=3, L=2, J=1.

But wait, that can't be right because J must be |L-S| to L+S. S=3 and L=2 → J can be 1,2,3,4,5. So 1 is possible.

Wait, but the problem says the final NN state has T=0. Let me check each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p
Final NN state: 7D1 → S=3, L=2, J=1.
T=0.

Check Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2 → 0 =3 +2 +1 mod2 → 3+2=5, 5+1=6 → 6 mod2=0. So 0=0 → condition holds.

Parity of NN state: (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = 1. But earlier, we have P_initial =1, P_NN × P_X =1. So P_X must be 1. But X has parity -1. So 1 × (-1) =-1, which doesn't equal P_initial (1). So this violates parity conservation. So option A is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 + p
Final state: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1, L=0 (S state), J=1.

Check Pauli condition: T=0 =1+0 +1 mod2 → 1+0=1 → 1+1=2 → mod2=0. Yes, 0=0.

Parity: P_NN = (-1)^0 =1. P_X=-1 → 1 × (-1) =-1. P_initial=1 → 1= -1? No. So this violates parity. So option B is not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 + f
Final state: 3D3 → S=1 (2S+1=3), L=2 (D), J=3 (since J can be L + S =3).

Pauli condition: T=0 → 1 +2 +1 =4 → 4 mod2=0 → 0=0. Good.

Parity: P_NN = (-1)^2 =1. X has parity -1 → 1 × (-1) =-1, which doesn't match initial P=1. So parity not conserved. So option C is not allowed.

Option D: 3P0 + s
Final state: 3P0 → S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1), L=1 (P), J=0.

Check Pauli condition: 1 +1 +1 =3 →3 mod2=1 → 0=1, which is false. So the condition is not met. So option D is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier, from the Pauli condition, we have T=0= S + L +1 mod2. So for option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1+1=3 mod2=1. So 0≠1. So condition not met. So option D is not allowed.

So all options except the correct one are allowed, but wait, I'm getting confused. Because the initial analysis suggests that some options don't satisfy parity or Pauli conditions.

Wait, but the initial parity is 1. For each option, after emission, the parity of the NN state would be P_NN = (-1)^L. Then, the product P_NN * P_X must equal P_initial (1).

So let's do that for each option:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 → P_NN=1 → P_X=-1 → product 1*-1=-1≠1. So parity not conserved. Not allowed.

Option B:3S1 → L=0 → P_NN=1 → product 1 *-1=-1≠1. Not allowed.

Option C:3D3 → L=2 → P_NN=1 → product 1*-1=-1≠1. Not allowed.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 → P_NN=-1 (because (-1)^1 =-1). So product: (-1) * (-1) =1 → which matches P_initial=1. So parity is conserved.

Now check Pauli condition for each option:

A) T=0: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → 5+1=6 → 6 mod2=0 → 0=0. Condition holds.

B) Final state S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → 1+1=2 → 0=0 → condition holds.

C) Final state S=1, L=2 →1+2=3 →3+1=4 → 0=0. Condition holds.

D) Final state S=1, L=1 →1+1=2 → 2+1=3 → 3 mod2=1 → 0≠1. Condition not met.

So the only option that satisfies both parity and Pauli condition is D, but wait, in option D, the Pauli condition isn't met, so it's not allowed.

Wait, but earlier, when considering option D, the parity is conserved, but the Pauli condition isn't met. So which one is the correct answer?

The question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the one that doesn't satisfy the conditions.

Looking again:

Only option D satisfies the parity condition (P_NN * P_X =1), but it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So it's not allowed.

Wait, but the Pauli condition is a must, so any option that doesn't satisfy it is invalid.

Looking at all options:

A: Pauli holds, parity fails.

B: Pauli holds, parity fails.

C: Pauli holds, parity fails.

D: Pauli fails, parity holds.

So which option is invalid? The one that doesn't satisfy either condition.

Wait, but the problem says that the Pauli condition must be satisfied. So the options that fail the Pauli condition are invalid.

Only option D fails the Pauli condition, so it's the one not permitted.

Wait, but earlier, in option D, the parity is conserved, but the Pauli condition isn't. So the emission in option D is not allowed because it violates the Pauli condition.

Therefore, the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the conditions provided and evaluate each option systematically:

### Key Information and Conditions:
1. **Initial State**: The two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state:
   - Total spin \( S = 0 \),
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J = 0 \),
   - Parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: The NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( P_X = -1 \). The final NN state has:
   - Isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \),
   - Pauli condition: \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \),
   - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN, final}} \cdot P_X \).

3. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the final NN state is \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = (-1)^{L(NN)} \). Since \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \) and \( P_X = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{NN, final}} \cdot (-1) \implies P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1.
   \]
   Thus, \( (-1)^{L(NN)} = -1 \), meaning \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

4. **Pauli Condition**: For \( T(NN) = 0 \):
   \[
   0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \( L(NN) \) is odd, \( S(NN) \) must be even. For two nucleons, \( S(NN) \) can only be \( 0 \) (even).

5. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial total angular momentum is \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \). After emission, the total angular momentum is \( J_{\text{NN}} + J_X \). Since \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), we must have \( J_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) and \( J_X = 0 \). For the NN system, \( J_{\text{NN}} = |L - S| \) to \( L + S \). With \( S = 0 \) and \( L \) odd, \( J_{\text{NN}} = L \), which cannot be zero. This implies no valid emission process, but we proceed to evaluate the options for consistency.
