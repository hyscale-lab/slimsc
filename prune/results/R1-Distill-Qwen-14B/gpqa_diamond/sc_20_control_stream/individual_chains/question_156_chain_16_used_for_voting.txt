Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Both reactions start with different ene structures: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent. It's commonly used in epoxidation of alkenes. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, right? For each starting alkene, the epoxide product would depend on the geometry of the double bond.

Wait, so (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. But wait, mCPBA adds with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because it's a peracid and does an epoxidation via an electrocyclic mechanism. So for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide structures would be different.

Wait, but wait, mCPBA epoxidizes the double bond. Let me think about the starting materials. Both are oct-4-ene, but E and Z configurations. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two CH2CH2 groups are opposite each other. When epoxidized, the oxygen will form a ring, and the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. So, the (E) isomer would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face, maybe leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, no. Wait, the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted process, so the stereochemistry of the epoxide will reflect the geometry of the double bond.

Wait, no. In epoxidation, the peracid (mCPBA) reacts with the alkene in a way that the two new bonds form on opposite faces. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, generating the epoxide. The addition is stereospecific. For a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen bonds on the same side? Or opposite? Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene is a pericyclic reaction, specifically an electrocyclic opening. The peracid's O-O breaks, and the epoxide forms. The alkene's geometry (E or Z) determines the configuration of the epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide forms, the oxygen adds in such a way that the substituents on the same side of the double bond (from the same face) would end up adjacent in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the example. Let's take (E)-2-butene. The configuration is trans. When epoxidized with mCPBA, you get trans-2,3-epoxybutane. Or wait, no, wait. Actually, the epoxide would retain the stereochemistry. Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think of the mechanism.

The epoxidation is a concerted process where the peracid (like mCPBA) attacks the double bond. The double bond is a π bond, and the peracid's oxygen forms a new bond. The geometry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are opposite each other. So when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen bridges would form in such a way that the substituents on the same carbon of the epoxide are on opposite sides.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Let's say (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but with the substituents on the double bond being on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, each oxygen comes from the same face of the double bond. Wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the peracid's O-O breaks, and the two new sigma bonds form on the same face as the peracid. So the resulting epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to remember that (E)- and (Z)- alkenes will form different epoxide diastereomers. So (E)-oct-4-ene gives a trans-epoxide, and (Z) gives a cis-epoxide? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, another approach: When you epoxidize (E)- and (Z)-but-2-ene, what do you get? For (E)-but-2-ene (trans), the epoxide formed will have the two new oxygen bonds on opposite sides. So the epoxide would be trans, so it's called trans-2,3-epoxybutane. Similarly, (Z)-but-2-ene (cis) would form cis-2,3-epoxybutane.

Wait, but wait, actually, for (E)-but-2-ene, the two CH2 groups are opposite each other. When epoxidized, the two new O's add across the same face. So for (E)-but-2-ene, the substituents (CH2 groups) will be on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So the epoxide would have the two substituents (from CH2) on opposite faces, making it a trans epoxide.

Wait, but for (E)-but-2-ene, the substituents on each carbon (the CH2 groups) are on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, the O adds in a way that the groups are adjacent in the epoxide. So the resulting epoxide would have the two substituents (from the same original groups) on the same face. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I should think about the end result. For (E)-oct-4-ene, after epoxidation, the substituents (the two ethyl groups on each side of the epoxide) will be on the same face. Because the (E) configuration has the substituents opposite in the alkene, so when you form the epoxide, they end up adjacent either trans or cis.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let me think: The starting alkene's configuration affects the configuration of the epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans double bond, the epoxide that forms will have the substituents (like the CH2CH2 groups) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So the epoxide would be a trans-diepoxide. Wait, no, the substituents are on adjacent carbons, so the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the substituents would be on the same face if the starting double bond is E.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the product. If the starting alkene is (E), after epoxidation, the two adjacent carbons (in the epoxide) have their substituents on opposite sides. So the epoxide would have a certain configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxidation of (E) and (Z) alkenes leads to different diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's take the specific case. Both reactions use one equivalent of mCPBA, which is enough for epoxidation. Then, after aqueous acid workup, what happens? Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA is an epoxidizing agent, but sometimes, when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening reactions. So in this problem, after epoxidation (Reaction 1 and 2), aqueous acid is added. So the products after aqueous acid are probably the ring-opened products.

Wait, that's an important point. So the initial step forms the epoxide, but then the second step is acid workup. What happens when an epoxide is treated with acid? It undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening. The epoxide ring opens in an acid to form a diol. The mechanism is that the acid (like H+) protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs by water (or another nucleophile) on the more substituted carbon, following the carbocation mechanism (but with possible stereochemical outcomes).

Wait, but wait. The epoxide is symmetric? Let's see. For oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be between carbons 4 and 5. Each of those carbons would have two CH2 groups adjacent: for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, octane is C8H18. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should structure it correctly.

Wait, oct-4-ene structure: CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count. Carbon 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: CH2, 4: CH2, but wait, no. Wait, the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, let me think again. The correct structure of oct-4-ene is:

CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but that's not possible. Wait, wait. The correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3 as oct-4-ene? No, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's 4 positions.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to move forward. Let's assume that the epoxide, when treated with acid, undergoes ring-opening to form a diol.

But wait, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration. For each starting (E) and (Z) isomer, the epoxide has a certain configuration, leading to diols with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but for each starting alkene, mCPBA gives one epoxide product. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, each epoxide gives a diol. So for each reaction, one epoxide gives one diol.

But wait, when the epoxide is symmetric, would the diol have the same configuration regardless of the epoxide's configuration? Or if the epoxide is asymmetric, the diol could have multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, the starting materials are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Let's imagine both have the same substituents on each end, making the epoxide symmetric or not.

Wait, for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Let's think again. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, no, perhaps the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5 in a chain of 8 carbons. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, I'm getting confused. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, the correct IUPAC name is oct-4-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 4-pentene or something. Wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps it's better to move on.

So, each starting alkene (E and Z) gives an epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives a diol. The question is, how many different diols are formed?

Wait, if the epoxide is asymmetric, then the diol could have multiple stereoisomers. For each epoxide, when it opens under acid conditions, does it form more than one diol?

Wait, the ring-opening of an epoxide in acidic conditions typically leads to a trans-diol, because the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon (due to carbocation formation), and the nucleophile comes from the opposite side. So the diol would have stereochemistry opposite the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but for each epoxide, the diol could be a single stereoisomer or have multiple.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Take (E)-but-2-ene. Epoxidation with mCPBA gives trans-2,3-epoxybutane. Then, treatment with aqueous acid would protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens, and water attacks the more substituted carbon (in this case, both are same). Wait, but in butane, the two carbons are similar. So when it opens, the diol formed would have which configuration?

Wait, in the case of trans-2,3-epoxybutane, the attack would happen from the opposite side leading to the diol. Let's imagine the epoxide as a three-membered ring with the two oxygens on opposite sides. So when the epoxide opens, each OH group would add to opposite sides, leading to a trans-diol. So the diol would have the two OH groups on opposite sides, which is a trans configuration.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a diol where the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons and on opposite faces. So the diol is a vicinal diol with a trans configuration.

Wait, but that's only if the epoxide is symmetric. For an asymmetric epoxide, the product might have more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, but in the case of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, their epoxides would be different, leading to different diols upon ring-opening.

Wait, so for each reaction:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → diol B.

So, when both are done, the chemist combines the products (diol A and diol B). Now, what's the possible number of stereoisomers in each diol?

Wait, if each diol has multiple stereoisomers, then the mixture would have multiple peaks in the HPLC.

Wait, but let's think: what is the structure of each diol?

Assuming the epoxide has two different substituents on each carbon, the ring-opening under acidic conditions could lead to two possible diastereomers. Or perhaps only one, depending on the symmetry.

Wait, for example, let's say the epoxide is asymmetric, then the attack could happen from either side, but in acidic conditions, the attack is from the opposite side of the leaving group. So if the epoxide is asymmetric, the diol would have two stereoisomers. Or maybe only one, because the ring-opening is stereospecific.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the product in more detail.

Suppose (E)-oct-4-ene gives an epoxide where the two adjacent carbons (4 and 5) each have different substituents. For example, carbon 4 has two CH2 groups on one side and a CH2CH2CH2CH3 on the other, and carbon 5 has a similar arrangement. Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine that each epoxide has two distinct substituents on each carbon. Then, when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens in a way that produces two different stereoisomers.

Wait, no. Wait, when the epoxide is asymmetric, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a diol with a specific configuration. Because the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, in an asymmetric epoxide, each carbon has different substituents. So when the epoxide opens, the attack occurs on the more substituted carbon, and the nucleophile comes from the opposite side. This leads to a diol with a specific configuration. But if the two epoxide carbons are not identical, then the diol can form in such a way that each stereoisomer is possible.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to a single diol, which is a pair of enantiomers if the diol has a chiral center. Alternatively, the diol might not have any chiral centers, depending on the structure.

Wait, but in the case of oct-4-ene, the diol would be 4,5-diol-octane. Wait, octane is 8 carbons. So 4 and 5 positions would have OH groups. Now, the structure of 4,5-diol-octane would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. So after epoxidation and ring-opening, the diol would be 4,5-diol-octane. The structure would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH(OH)CH(OH)-CH2CH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, maybe the positions are 4 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the diol is in positions 4 and 5 of octane, giving HO-CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the diol would be on carbons 4 and 5, so the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH(OH)CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to consider that the diol has two adjacent OH groups. So, for each starting epoxide (from E and Z alkenes), the diol could have either a cis or trans configuration, depending on the epoxide's structure.

Wait, but when you epoxidize (E)-oct-4-ene, you get an epoxide with a certain configuration, which upon acid treatment gives a diol. Similarly for (Z)-oct-4-ene.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but since the HPLC columns are used, let's think about how they would separate.

The first part of the question is about combining the products of both reactions and running them on standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

In the standard HPLC (achiral), compounds that are enantiomers would co-elute as a single peak because the column doesn't distinguish between enantiomers. But if the diol has multiple stereoisomers that are not mirror images, like diastereomers, they would elute as separate peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, enantiomers would elute as separate peaks because the column is chiral and can differentiate between them.

So, let's think about what the products are.

Each reaction produces a diol. Let's say Reaction 1 gives diol A, and Reaction 2 gives diol B. Are these diols the same or different?

Wait, what's the difference between the diols from (E) and (Z) epoxides.

Wait, the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene's epoxide would have a certain arrangement of substituents, and the diol from (Z) would have another. So perhaps each diol has two stereoisomers, leading to a total of four possible isomers.

Wait, let me think again. Each reaction produces a diol. Each diol could have two possible stereoisomers, but if the diol is meso, then it might have fewer.

Wait, for example, if the diol is a vicinal diol with two OH groups on adjacent carbons, and the two substituents on each carbon are same, making it a meso compound. Then, the diol would have only one stereoisomer.

But if the substituents are different, each diol could have two enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the diol from each epoxide is a meso compound, meaning that it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, it might be chiral.

Wait, let me imagine the structure of the diol. Suppose the diol is 4,5-diol-octane. The structure would be HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Let's look for symmetry. If the left and right substituents on the diol are mirror images, it could be a meso compound.

Wait, the diol would have the structure:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)CH(OH)-CH2CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to think of the diol as HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a straight chain with two OHs on adjacent carbons. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two OHs. But wait, in reality, the structure would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, so the molecule is symmetric around the center between the two OHs. Because the substituents on either side of the diol are mirror images.

Wait, so the molecule would be a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, the diol from each reaction would be a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, if the starting epoxide from (E) and (Z) alkenes leads to diols that are different, perhaps the diols are not the same.

Wait, so Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → diol B.

If diol A and diol B are different compounds, then when combined, the mixture would have diol A and diol B. If each diol is itself a single compound (meso), then on standard HPLC, they would show as two peaks. On chiral HPLC, since each is meso (achiral), they would also show as two peaks.

But wait, let me double-check. For each starting epoxide, the diol formed after acid treatment would be a meso compound. So each reaction produces one diol, which is a single compound, meso. So when both are combined, the mixture has two different diols.

Wait, but how do the diols from (E) and (Z) alkenes differ?

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E) is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z) is another meso compound, but different from the first.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), which have different configurations. When epoxidized, they form different epoxides. Upon acid treatment, each epoxide gives a diol. If each diol is a meso compound, then each diol is a single compound, but if the diols from (E) and (Z) are different, then combining them would give two different diols, each as a single compound.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but then the HPLC would show different numbers of peaks.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take (E)- and (Z)-but-2-ene.

(E)-But-2-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3 (but E would mean the substituents are opposite, which in this case, since it's but-2-ene, substituents are CH3 and H on each carbon. Wait, no, but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, which is actually (Z) if the two CH2CH3 groups are on the same side, but wait, no, but-2-ene doesn't have substituents on both ends. Wait, perhaps it's better to pick another example.

Alternatively, let's take (E)- and (Z)-2-pentene. (E)-2-pentene would have CH3 and CH2CH2CH3 on opposite sides. When epoxidized, it forms an epoxide where the substituents are on opposite sides. Upon acid treatment, the diol formed would have the OH groups on adjacent carbons, but if the substituents on each carbon are different, the diol might not have a plane of symmetry and thus be chiral.

Wait, but for oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are symmetric. Because oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, I think the confusion is arising because I'm not correctly identifying the structure.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. No, that's an 8-carbon chain with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5.

So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, I'm getting stuck. Let me move on.

Assuming that each diol is a meso compound, then combining Reaction 1 and 2 products would give two diols, each as a single peak on standard HPLC. On chiral HPLC, since they are meso, they would also appear as single peaks. So total peaks would be two in each case.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options:

Option C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

That would fit if each reaction gives a single diol, which is a meso compound, and combining them gives two different diols.

But wait, I'm not sure. What if each reaction gives a diol that is a pair of enantiomers?

Wait, in that case, each diol would be a pair of enantiomers, but since they are in an achiral environment, they would appear as a single peak on standard HPLC. But on chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would elute separately, leading to two peaks per diol. But then, since we have two diols, each contributing two peaks, the total would be four peaks on chiral HPLC and two on standard.

But looking at the options, option D says 3 peaks in standard and 4 in chiral. Option A says 4 in both. Option B says 2 and 3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces two diastereomers, not enantiomers. So for each epoxide, the diol has two stereoisomers. So Reaction 1 would give two diols, and Reaction 2 would give two diols. But wait, that can't be right because the reaction goes to 100% completion, so each reaction would produce a single product.

Wait, no, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, which can have multiple stereoisomers. But if the diol is meso, then it's a single stereoisomer.

Wait, so for each reaction, the product is a single diol. If each diol is a meso compound, then each is a single compound. Combining them would give two compounds, leading to two peaks on standard and two on chiral HPLC. So option C would be the case.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but that's only possible if the diol is not meso.

Wait, but if the diol is not meso, then it's chiral, and the reaction would produce a racemic mixture, but since the reaction is with one equivalent of mCPBA, which is an stereospecific reagent, each reaction would produce a single enantiomer.

Wait, but no, because the epoxidation leads to a specific diastereomer, and the ring-opening under acidic conditions also leads to a specific diastereomer. So each reaction gives a single diol, which may be a pair of enantiomers or a meso compound.

Wait, so let's say each reaction gives a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. Then, each reaction would give a racemic mixture, but since the reaction is 100% efficient, it would produce only one enantiomer, not a racemic mix. Alternatively, perhaps each reaction gives a single enantiomer, leading to each diol being a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of the possible products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → diol B.

If diol A is a meso compound and diol B is another meso compound, then combining them would give two different diols, each appearing as a single peak on standard HPLC. On chiral HPLC, since they're meso, they would also appear as single peaks. So the chromatograms would show two peaks in both cases.

But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If each reaction produces a diol that is a meso compound, then the products from each reaction would be a single compound each. So when you combine them, you have two different diols, each appearing as a single peak on standard HPLC. On a chiral HPLC, since each is a meso (achiral), they would still be single peaks. So the standard HPLC would have two peaks, and chiral HPLC would also have two peaks. So option C is correct.

But another possibility is that each diol is chiral, not meso. Then, each diol would have two enantiomers. But since each reaction is 100% efficient and produces a single enantiomer, combining the two reactions would give two different diols, each as a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, each reaction produces a single enantiomer.

Wait, no, each reaction produces a single diol. If the diol is chiral, then it would have two enantiomers. But since the reaction is stereospecific, each reaction would produce a single stereoisomer. So, for each reaction, you get a single diastereomer. So, when you combine them, you have two diastereomers, each as a single enantiomer. Then, on standard HPLC, they would show as two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would be a single peak, so two peaks. So again, option C.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this, because I'm not entirely sure about the structure of the diols.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a meso compound, so each reaction gives a single peak, leading to two peaks in total. So option C.

Hmm. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA is a stereospecific epoxidizing agent that converts alkenes into epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the resulting epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a vicinal diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide, which is influenced by the geometry of the starting alkene.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**: (E)-oct-4-ene forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. Upon acid treatment, this epoxide produces a diol. The diol from (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

2. **Reaction 2**: (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a different epoxide with a distinct stereochemistry. Upon acid treatment, this epoxide produces another diol. Similarly, the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene is also a meso compound, making it achiral.

3. **Combining the Products**: After combining the products of both reactions, the mixture contains two distinct diols, each of which is a meso compound. 

### HPLC Analysis:
- **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Since both diols are achiral (meso compounds), they will each elute as a single peak. Thus, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral HPLC columns can resolve enantiomers, but since both diols are meso compounds and achiral, they will each elute as a single peak. Thus, the chiral HPLC will also show **2 peaks**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (4 peaks in both HPLCs)**: Incorrect. Each diol is a single compound (meso), so there are only two distinct compounds in the mixture.
- **Option B (2 peaks in standard HPLC, 3 peaks in chiral HPLC)**: Incorrect. There are no additional stereoisomers or impurities to produce extra peaks.
- **Option C (2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC)**: Correct. Each diol is a single meso compound, resulting in two peaks in both chromatograms.
- **Option D (3 peaks in standard HPLC, 4 peaks in chiral HPLC)**: Incorrect. There are only two distinct diols, each as a single compound.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as the standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms each show two peaks corresponding to the two distinct meso diols.

Answer: C
