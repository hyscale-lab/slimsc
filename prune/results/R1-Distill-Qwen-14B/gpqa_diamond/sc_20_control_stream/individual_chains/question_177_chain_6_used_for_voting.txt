Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

So, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is related to its temperature by Wien's Law. Oh right, Wien's Law says λ_max * T = constant. So if both stars emit their peak at the same wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Or wait, because λ_max is the same, T must be the same because the constant is the same for both. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait, why are their temperatures the same? Because if they're emitting at the same peak, that implies same T. So that simplifies things. Since they're both black bodies, their luminosity should depend on radius and temperature.

The formula for luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So given that R and T are factors, I can compute the luminosity ratio.

So let's see, Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. Both have T1 = T2 = T, because their peak wavelengths are same. So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴. And L2 is 4π R2² σ T⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / (R2^2 ) ) because the other terms are same for both. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is ~2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives radial velocities. Oh wait, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, what's that got to do with it? Because in the problem statement, the astronomers have calculated the luminosity based on black body radiation, so I think the radial velocities are a red herring here. Because luminosity in this context is intrinsic, not as observed (which could involve Doppler shifts). But the question says they computed the luminosity assuming they radiate as black bodies, so the radial velocities probably don't affect the calculation.

So the answer should be based on L = 4πR²σT⁴, with same T and R1=1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Blackbody radiation and the peak wavelength being same implies same temperature. So yes, T is same for both. So the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A, 2.25.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the formula for the luminosity of a star radiating as a black body:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that the peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same, which implies, by Wien's Law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}\)), that their temperatures are also the same (\(T_1 = T_2 = T\)).

The radius of Star_1 is given as \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting this into the luminosity formula, the ratio of the luminosities is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{4\pi (1.5 R_2)^2 \sigma T^4}{4\pi R_2^2 \sigma T^4} = \frac{(1.5)^2 R_2^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. The radial velocities of the stars (0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2) are not relevant to this calculation, as the problem explicitly states that the luminosities are computed based on black-body radiation, which depends only on intrinsic properties like radius and temperature.

Therefore, the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately **2.25**, corresponding to option A.
