Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination chemistry. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So a higher β means the complex is more stable, right? So the more stable complexes will form more.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that the color of the complex depends on the number of ligands attached. I think for cobalt, [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes have different colors based on n. For example, the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion is pink, but when SCN- replaces the water, the color changes. The blue ones are probably the tetrathiocyanato complex, like [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ maybe?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe it's something else. Wait, wait, the term 'dithiocyanato' probably refers to two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state, so each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, that can't be. Wait, the formula would need to balance the charge. Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- would make [Co(SCN)_2]^0? But that's neutral. Hmm, but wait, I might be getting mixed up. Maybe it's [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)? Because each SCN is -1. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+, n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Oh, I see.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm not exactly sure which complex is blue, but perhaps the tetra or tri? Wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^− is blue. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. Hmm, I'm not 100% certain, but let's proceed.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complexes among all cobalt species. So I think we need to calculate the fraction of Co in each possible complex and then sum the fractions for the blue ones.

But first, the possible complexes are [Co], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Wait, but in the problem, the stability constants are given up to β4=16. So maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, perhaps? Or maybe for the first substitution.

Wait, the stability constant (formation constant) β for a complex [MLn] is given by β = [MLn]/([M][L]^n). So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+ would form from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So the formation reactions would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ ; β1=9

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; β2=40

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ; β3=63

[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2− ; β4=16

Wait, but wait, the β values are for each step. So to find the overall β for each complex, you multiply the stepwise βs. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) would be the product of β1 to βn.

So for each complex:

β1 = 9 → [CoSCN]^+

β2 = 40 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (so overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1 * β2 = 9*40=360)

β3 = 63 → for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , overall β is 9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63= 22680

β4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, overall β is 9*40*63*16= 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, wait, but what about the order? Because the stability constants can sometimes be listed in a way that the last step has a lower β, which may affect the distribution.

So the idea is that each subsequent complex is formed by adding another SCN^-.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue complex. Let's assume that the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is the fourth complex. Alternatively, maybe it's another complex, but the question says "blue dithiocyanato complexes." Wait, "dithiocyanato" would imply two SCN ligands. So perhaps the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the dithiocyanato. So if the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, perhaps that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe the tetra is blue; I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Let me think, Co^2+ with two SCN^- would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's a neutral complex, right? But does that complex have a blue color? I'm a bit shaky on that. Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^−2 is blue. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on which complex is blue, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculations, and see which option matches.

The general approach is to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible species, considering the stability constants and the concentrations.

So, the first step is to consider all possible species of Co in solution.

The possible species are:

1. Free Co^2+ → [Co^2+]

2. [CoSCN]^+ → from Co^2+ + SCN^-

3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → from [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^-

4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- → from [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^-

5. [Co(SCN)_4]^2− → from [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^-

Wait, but the problem mentions "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M", which includes all species. So the sum of all the concentrations of Co species equals 1e-2 M.

But since the solution is at equilibrium, we can model the distribution using the formation constants.

Let me think about how to model this. The problem is a log-f problem, log fraction problems. So each species' concentration can be expressed in terms of the others, and then we can set up a system of equations.

But perhaps a more straightforward way is to consider the fractions of each species.

Let me denote the following fractions:

Let x_n be the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+?), but perhaps it's better to consider each species' contribution.

Wait, another approach is to use the distribution of Co among the various complexes, considering the log of the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN^-.

Each step of complexation can be represented as:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n)

The formation constant for each step is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co][SCN]^n).

But considering all the steps together, the overall β for n=1 to 4 is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, no, the overall β for the complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise β1 to βn.

So for n=1, β=β1=9.

n=2, β=β1*β2=9*40=360.

n=3, β=9*40*63=22680.

n=4, β=9*40*63*16=362880.

So the overall β for each complex is:

β1=9 → [CoSCN]^+,

β2=360 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0,

β3=22680 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-,

β4=362880 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But wait, some of these β values are very high, which suggests that higher complexes are more favored.

But the presence of SCN^- (0.1 M) is also a factor. So the higher the β and the higher the [SCN^-], the more likely higher complexes form.

But let's think about how to model this.

The general approach for such a problem is to consider each complex in terms of the previous one.

We can model the distribution using the following approach:

Let’s denote the free Co^2+ as x.

Then, the concentration of [CoSCN]^+ is β1 * x * [SCN^-].

The concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 x [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * [SCN^-] = β3 * β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^- * [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^4.

So the concentrations of each complex can be expressed in terms of x and the βs.

Let’s write each concentration:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-] = 9 x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] = 40 * (0.9 x) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x

Wait, no. Wait, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is formed from [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^-, so the rate is β2 multiplied by [CoSCN]^+ and [SCN^-].

Wait, more accurately, [CoSCN]^+ is β1 x [SCN^-].

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN^-]) ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

So substituting numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, [SCN^-]=0.1 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 9*40 x (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * [SCN^-] = β3 * (β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3.

So [Co(SCN)_3]^- = 9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

Wait, 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680. 22680 * 0.001 is 22.68.

Then, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^- * [SCN^-] = β4 * (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4.

So substituting, 9*40*63*16 x * (0.1)^4.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. (0.1)^4=1e-4.

So [Co(SCN)_4]^2− = 362880 x * 1e-4 = 36.288 x.

So now, all the species:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−=36.288 x

Now, the sum of all these concentrations must equal the total cobalt concentration, which is c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So:

x + 0.9 x + 3.6 x + 22.68 x + 36.288 x = 1e-2

Adding them up:

(1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) x = 1e-2

Let me compute the sum:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68 =28.18

28.18 +36.288 =64.468

So 64.468 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) /64.468 ≈ 1.550e-4 M.

So [Co^2+] =1.550e-4 M.

Now, the fractions of each species are:

For [Co^2+], fraction is (1.550e-4 ) / (1e-2) ) = 0.01550 → 1.55% approximately.

[CoSCN]^+ is 0.9x → 0.9 *1.550e-4 =1.395e-4 M. Fraction: (1.395e-4)/(1e-2) )=0.01395 → 1.395%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0: 3.6x=3.6 *1.550e-4 =5.58e-4. Fraction: 5.58e-4 /1e-2 =0.0558 → 5.58%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^-: 22.68 x = 22.68 *1.55e-4 =3.52e-3. Fraction: 3.52e-3 /1e-2 =0.352 → 35.2%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−:36.288 x =36.288 *1.55e-4 ≈ 5.61e-3. Fraction: 5.61e-3 /1e-2= 0.561 →56.1%.

Wait, let's add these fractions to check:

1.55 +1.395=2.945

+5.58=8.525

+35.2=43.725

+56.1= 99.825%. Hmm, that's close to 100%, considering rounding errors. So perhaps the exact sum would be 100%.

Now, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes.

But wait, what's the correct species for blue? Earlier confusion arises.

If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, then the percentage is 56.1%. But the options don't have such a high percentage.

Alternatively, if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex, then the percentage is 5.58%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the blue complex. Another possibility is that [Co(SCN)_4]^− is blue, but that would be the tetra complex, which is 56% here.

But looking at the options, the highest is 42.3% (option A), then 38.1% (C), 25.6 (B), 16.9 (D). So 56% isn't an option.

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the β4 is the last step is incorrect. Let me think about the steps again.

Wait, the problem statement gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is smaller than β3. That's a bit odd because usually, the stepwise formation constants decrease as the coordination number increases. So the first complex is more easily formed than the second, etc. But in this case, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So the fourth step is less favored than the third.

Wait, this complicates things because the fourth complex may not be as favored as the third.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Because if β4 is 16, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4] is β1*β2*β3*β4 = 9*40*63*16 = as before 362880.

But wait, perhaps the complexes can dissociate, and the order of stability might change. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the formation of [Co(SCN)_4]^2− but perhaps the solution is more likely to form a lower complex because β4 is lower than β3. Wait, but β4 is still quite high, so perhaps the complexes up to [Co(SCN)_4]^2− are formed, but perhaps in lower amounts than the third.

Wait, maybe the maximum complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- because β4 is lower. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the solution allows for all steps, but the β4 being lower than β3 would imply that adding the fourth SCN is less favored than the third.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the concentrations correctly, considering that the fourth complex is less favored.

Wait, so let's recompute the concentrations, but perhaps the fourth complex isn't the dominant one. Let me re-calculate all steps.

So, going back:

We have:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 x *0.1 =0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] =40 *0.9 x *0.1 = 40 *0.09 x =3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^0 [SCN^-] =63 *3.6 x *0.1 =63 *0.36 x =22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^- [SCN^-] =16 *22.68 x *0.1 =16 *2.268 x = 36.288 x

Wait, that's the same as before.

So the sum is 64.468 x =1e-2 → x=1.55e-4.

So the fractions are as before.

But the problem is that the options don't match 56% or 35% for the higher complexes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which complex is considered the blue dithiocyanato. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to the tetra complex, which has four SCN groups. No, dithiocyanato would be two, right? Dithiocyanate is two SCN groups. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second complex.

In that case, the percentage for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 5.58%, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is the fourth complex, but that's 56.1% and that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about the definition of dithiocyanato. Maybe it's the tetra complex, but that would be polythiocyanato, not dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but in that case, the percentage is 5.58% which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate the fractions more accurately.

Wait, let's compute all the concentrations precisely.

x = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001550 M.

Then,

[Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.0001550 → 1.55e-4.

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x = 0.9 *1.55e-4 =1.395e-4.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =3.6 x =3.6 *1.55e-4 = 5.58e-4.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =22.68 x =22.68 *1.55e-4 =3.52e-3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−=36.288 x=36.288 *1.55e-4 ≈5.614e-3.

Now, let's compute each fraction:

Total Co =1e-2 M.

[Co^2+] fraction: 1.55e-4 /1e-2 =0.0155 →1.55%.

[CoSCN]^+ :1.395e-4 /1e-2 =0.01395 →1.395%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0:5.58e-4 /1e-2 =0.0558 →5.58%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^-:3.52e-3 /1e-2 =0.352 →35.2%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−:5.614e-3 /1e-2 =0.5614 →56.14%.

Wait, adding them up: 1.55 +1.395=2.945; +5.58=8.525; +35.2=43.725; +56.14=99.865%. Close to 100%, considering rounding.

But the options don't have 56% or 35%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue dithiocyanato.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato as [Co(SCN)_2]^- instead of neutral? Or perhaps it's [Co(SCN)_4]^−. Wait, but earlier calculations said [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is 56% and [Co(SCN)_3]^- is 35%.

But the options don't include 56%, so perhaps the question is about another complex.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which would be the first complex. No, that's [CoSCN]^+.

Wait, perhaps the answer is the sum of all the complexes except the free Co^2+ and the first complex. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the stability constants. Let me double-check the approach.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that complex.

So,

β1 =9 → [CoSCN]^+

β_total,1=9.

β2=40 → β_total,2=9*40=360.

β3=63 → β_total,3=9*40*63=22680.

β4=16 → β_total,4=9*40*63*16=362880.

But when considering the formation of each complex, the overall β is used.

But perhaps the correct way is to calculate the fraction for each complex as (β_total,n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum of (β_total,k [SCN]^k ) for k=0 to 4).

Wait, that's another approach. The general formula for the fraction of a species is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum over all k of β_k [SCN]^k ) ).

Wait, but wait, the [Co^2+] is when n=0. So the fraction of each species would be (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k ), where β_0 is 1, because [Co^2+] is the free ion.

Wait, that might be a better way to approach this.

So, the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k ) )

But β_0 is 1 (as the free ion has no ligands), β_1=9, β_2=360, β_3=22680, β_4=362880.

[SCN] =0.1 M.

So, let's compute each term β_n [SCN]^n:

n=0: 1*(0.1)^0 =1.

n=1:9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

n=2:360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all these terms: 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.

So, the sum is 64.468.

Now, the fractions are:

f0 =1/64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55%.

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01395 →1.395%.

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.0558 →5.58%.

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%.

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5614 →56.14%.

So the fractions are as before.

Now, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Which one is that?

Wait, perhaps it's [Co(SCN)_4]^2− which is the fourth complex, with f4=56.14%. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- with f3=35.2%? But the options don't have that either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's look at the options:

A)42.3% B)25.6% C)38.1% D)16.9%.

Wait, 35% is close to option C (38.1%) but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions.

Wait, wait, let me recompute the fractions precisely.

n=0:1 →1.

n=1:9*0.1=0.9.

n=2:360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum =1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So sum is 64.468.

So f4 =36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5614 →56.14%.

But perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is 3.6/64.468 = 0.0558 →5.58%.

That's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (35.2%) or [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (56.14%). But these are not in the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating the species fractions. Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. For example, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc., which would change the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps the stepwise βs are given for each additional ligand, but the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product up to n ligands. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering another form of the dithiocyanato complex, like [Co(SCN)_2]^something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. For example, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ would have a charge of (2+) + 2*(-1) =0, so neutral. But perhaps the problem refers to [CoSCN]^+ as the dithiocyanato complex? No, that's mono.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which isn't the same as the tetra or tri.

Wait, perhaps the correct species for blue is [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which would have a higher fraction. But 35.2% isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^−, but that would require Co^2+ with two SCN^- and a charge of (2+) + 2*(-1) =0, so neutral. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the possible dithiocyanato complexes, regardless of the other complexes. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the sum of all species except free Co^2+ and the first complex. But that's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation. Let me recheck the formation constants.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formation constants are given as the overall constants, not stepwise. So β1=9 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3=63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , β4=16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, in that case, the calculations are different.

Because if β2 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then the fractions would be calculated using β2, not β1 * β2.

Wait, that's a different scenario. So let's think again.

If the βs are given as overall constants, then:

β1 = [CoSCN]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) → β1=9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 ) → β2=40.

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3]^- / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 ) → β3=63.

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4]^2− / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 ) → β4=16.

In this case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^m is βn.

So the concentrations would be:

[Co^2+] = x.

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 x *0.1 =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =40 x (0.1)^2 =40 x 0.01 =0.4 x.

Wait, but that's different from before.

Wait, but this approach would change the concentrations. Let me recompute.

In this case, each complex is formed from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So,

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 x *0.1=0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =40 x (0.01) =0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 x [SCN^-]^3 =63 x (0.001) =0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = β4 x [SCN^-]^4 =16 x (0.0001)=0.0016 x.

So the concentrations are:

x (free Co^2+),

0.9x, 0.4x, 0.063x, 0.0016x.

Summing all:

x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 ) x = 2.3646 x.

Set equal to 1e-2 M:

2.3646 x =1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈4.225e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, this can't be right. Because if [Co^2+] is 4.225e-3 M, and the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, that would imply that the sum of all species (which includes x plus other terms) is 1e-2.

But in this approach, the sum is 2.3646 x =1e-2 → x=4.225e-3.

Wait, but let's compute each species:

[Co^2+] =4.225e-3 M.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9x=0.9 *4.225e-3 ≈3.8025e-3.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0=0.4x=0.4*4.225e-3 ≈1.69e-3.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =0.063x=0.063*4.225e-3≈2.66e-4.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−=0.0016x= approx 6.76e-6.

Now, the fractions:

[Co^2+]:4.225e-3 /1e-2 =0.4225 →42.25%.

[CoSCN]^+ :3.8025e-3 /1e-2=0.38025 →38.025%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0:1.69e-3 /1e-2=0.169 →16.9%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^-:2.66e-4 /1e-2=0.0266 →2.66%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−:6.76e-6 /1e-2=0.000676 →0.0676%.

Now, adding up:42.25+38.025=80.275 +16.9=97.175 +2.66=99.835 +0.0676≈99.9%.

So, the blue dithiocyanato complex is which one? If [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the dithiocyanato, its fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN groups. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is dithiocyanato, and its fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when considering stepwise βs, the fraction was 5.58%, which isn't an option. But in this approach, the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So which interpretation is correct? Are the βs stepwise or overall?

Ah, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." Stability constants are usually given as overall constants, meaning βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth complex.

So when the problem says β1=9, it refers to the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. Similarly, β2=40 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 from Co^2+ and two SCN^-, and so on.

So, in this case, the correct approach is to use the overall βs, not the stepwise βs. So the fractions are as I calculated in the second approach.

So, in that case, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (dithiocyanato) has a fraction of 16.9%, which is option D:16.9%.

Wait, but the problem states that the β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. So the fourth complex is less favored than the third.

Wait, but in this approach, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is only 0.0676% of the total. So the major species are [Co^2+] (42.25%), [CoSCN]^+ (38.025%), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (16.9%).

But the problem is that the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then 16.9% is the correct answer, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, then it's 0.0676%, which isn't an option.

So the correct approach is to use the overall βs, and the answer is option D.

But wait, in the first approach, which assumed stepwise βs, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 was 5.58%, which isn't any option. But in the second approach, using overall βs, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations. The stability constants provided are overall constants, meaning each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the corresponding complex from Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ions. The species considered are:

1. Free Co²⁺  
2. [CoSCN]⁺  
3. [Co(SCN)₂]⁰  
4. [Co(SCN)₃]⁻  
5. [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻  

The total cobalt concentration is given as 1.0 × 10⁻² M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The fractions of each species are calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

where \( \beta_0 = 1 \) corresponds to the free Co²⁺ ion. Substituting the values:

- \( \beta_0 = 1, [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \)  
- \( \beta_1 = 9, [\text{SCN}]^1 = 0.1 \)  
- \( \beta_2 = 40, [\text{SCN}]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \)  
- \( \beta_3 = 63, [\text{SCN}]^3 = (0.1)^3 = 0.001 \)  
- \( \beta_4 = 16, [\text{SCN}]^4 = (0.1)^4 = 0.0001 \)  

The numerator for each species is calculated as:

- \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \)  
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)  
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)  
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)  
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)  

The sum of all terms is:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fractions of each species are then:

- \( f_0 = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \) (42.25%)  
- \( f_1 = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.3803 \) (38.03%)  
- \( f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1690 \) (16.90%)  
- \( f_3 = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \) (2.66%)  
- \( f_4 = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000676 \) (0.0676%)  

The question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complex, which corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂]⁰. The fraction of this species is 16.90%, which matches option D.

Answer: D
