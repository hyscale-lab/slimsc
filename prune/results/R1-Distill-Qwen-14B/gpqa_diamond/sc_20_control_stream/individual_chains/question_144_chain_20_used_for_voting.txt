Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The problem gives me some numbers: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, okay, so the width is the decay width, right? And I remember that the decay width is related to the lifetime of the particle. Like, a larger width means a shorter lifetime because the particle decays more quickly.

But what exactly am I being asked here? The mean decay distance, which I think depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is usually given by the product of the particle's lifetime (τ) and its velocity (βc), where β is v/c. So, L = βγcτ, but wait, I might be mixing up some factors here. Alternatively, I think the formula is something like L = (cτ) * β, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, more accurately, the mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, the formula should be L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle and τ is the proper lifetime. But since the particle is moving relativistically, I need to account for time dilation. So, the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor γ.

Wait, correct formula: The lifetime observed in the lab frame τ_lab is τ = τ0 * γ, where τ0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). Then, the velocity v is approximately c for particles with high energies. So, L = v * τ_lab = c * τ0 * γ.

But how do I find τ0? I remember that the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ0, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, τ0 = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me make sure. The width Γ is the total decay rate, which is the inverse of the lifetime (times some constants). So, Γ = ħ / τ0. Therefore, τ0 = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that? Or wait, let's get the units right.

I know that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Right, because when you have natural units, but in terms of units with c and ħ included, we can convert between energy and inverse time.

So, first step: calculate τ0, the proper lifetime.

Given that Γ_X is 320 MeV. Oh wait, units! Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So,

τ0 = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s? No, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so τ0 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that's 2.056875 × 10^-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes, correct.

Next, I need to find the Lorentz factor γ, which is E/(m c²), but wait, since E is the total energy, and m is the rest mass, and we are using units where c=1, but I need to be careful with units here. Wait, the energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², so in natural units, E = γ m c². But in our case, since we're using units where c is 1 (GeV and GeV/c²), so E = γ m.

So, γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So, γ ≈ 6.6667.

But wait, since the particle is moving relativistically, and for high γ, β approaches 1. So, β ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ≈ 1 - (1/(2γ²)), but for large γ, it's approximately 1. So, I can approximate β as being very close to 1, so v ≈ c.

So, the velocity v ≈ c, so the distance L is approximately c * τ_lab. And τ_lab is γ τ0.

So, putting it together:

L ≈ c * γ τ0.

Wait, or wait, L = v * τ_lab = c * (γ τ0) since τ_lab = γ τ0.

Wait, let me make sure. So, τ_lab = γ τ0. So, L = v * τ_lab = (β c) * (γ τ0) ) = c τ0 γ β.

But since β ≈ 1, this simplifies to c τ0 γ.

So, L ≈ c * τ0 * γ.

Now, let's compute τ0 * γ first. τ0 is 2.056875e-24 s, γ is approximately 6.6667.

So τ0 * γ = 2.056875e-24 s * 6.6667 ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L ≈ c * (1.37125e-23 s).

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So,

L ≈ 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 meters.

Wait, that's 4.11375e-15 m. Let me see the options. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D) 4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation is 4.11375e-15, which is close to option B, which is about 4.0655e-15. But wait, perhaps my approximation of β as 1 isn't accurate enough. Because when γ is 6.6667, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)).

Let's compute beta more accurately. So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/E²), but in natural units where c=1, beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So, m/E is 1.2/8 = 0.15. So, m²/(E²) is 0.0225. So,

beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So, beta is about 0.9887, not exactly 1. So, I shouldn't have approximated beta as 1. That changes the calculation.

So, let me redo the calculation more accurately.

So, L = v τ_lab = β c * τ_lab.

But τ_lab = γ τ0.

So,

L = β c γ τ0.

So, τ0 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, compute each part step by step.

Compute gamma: 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... ≈ 6.666667.

Compute beta: sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, beta is approximately 0.9887.

So, L = beta * c * gamma * tau0.

Compute gamma * tau0 first: 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 13.7125e-24 s → 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply by beta: 0.9887 * 1.37125e-23 s ≈ 1.356e-23 s.

Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 1.356e-23 s = 3e8 * 1.356e-23 = 4.068e-15 m.

That's approximately 4.068e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference could be due to more precise calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.

0.9775 is 9775/10000. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

We can approximate sqrt(0.9775):

I know that 0.988^2 = ? Let's see: 0.988 * 0.988.

0.988 * 0.988 = (0.98 * 0.98) + (0.008 * 0.98 * 2) + (0.008)^2.

Wait, maybe better to compute 0.988^2.

0.988 * 0.988:

= (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 = 0.976144.

Wait, but 0.988^2 is 0.976144, but we need sqrt(0.9775), which is a bit higher than 0.988.

Wait, perhaps using a linear approximation.

Let x = 0.9775. Let’s let f(x) = sqrt(x) around x = 0.976144.

So, f'(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)).

At x = 0.976144, f(x)=0.988, f'(x) = 1/(2 * 0.988) ≈ 0.5065.

We need to find delta x = 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

So, delta f ≈ f'(x) * delta x ≈ 0.5065 * 0.001356 ≈ 0.000685.

So, f(x) ≈ 0.988 + 0.000685 ≈ 0.988685. So, around 0.9887, which is what I had before.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach for sqrt(0.9775):

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me compute 0.9887^2: (0.9887)^2 = ?

Compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*(0.98)(0.0087) = 2*0.98*0.0087 = 1.96 * 0.0087 ≈ 0.017052.

(0.0087)^2 = 0.00007569.

Adding them up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

But our target is 0.9775, so 0.9887^2 ≈ 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

The difference is 0.97752769 - 0.9775 = 0.00002769.

So, to get a better approximation, perhaps subtract a tiny bit from 0.9887.

Let me find delta such that (0.9887 - delta)^2 ≈ 0.9775.

(0.9887 - delta)^2 ≈ 0.9775.

Expanding:

0.9887² - 2*0.9887*delta + delta² ≈ 0.9775.

We know 0.9887² is approximately 0.97752769.

So,

0.97752769 - (2 * 0.9887 * delta) ≈ 0.9775.

The difference is 0.97752769 - 0.9775 = 0.00002769.

So,

0.97752769 - (2 * 0.9887 * delta) ≈ 0.9775 → 2*0.9887 * delta ≈ 0.00002769 → delta ≈ 0.00002769/(2*0.9887) ≈ 0.00002769 / 1.9774 ≈ 1.400e-5.

So, delta is approximately 1.4e-5. So, beta ≈ 0.9887 - 1.4e-5 ≈ 0.988686.

So, beta ≈ 0.988686.

So, more accurately, beta is approximately 0.988686.

Now, let's compute L again with this more precise beta.

So, L = beta * c * gamma * tau0.

gamma is 6.6666666667.

tau0 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating L:

gamma * tau0 = 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

Then, 0.66666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (2/3)* 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-24? Wait, no:

Wait, 0.66666666667 is 2/3. 2/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (4.11375e-24)/3 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

So, 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 * 2.056875e-24) + (0.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24) = 12.34125e-24 + 1.37125e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s → 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, multiply by beta (0.988686):

1.37125e-23 s * 0.988686 ≈ 1.356e-23 s.

Then multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

3e8 m/s * 1.356e-23 s = (3 * 1.356) * 1e-15 = 4.068e-15 m.

So, about 4.068e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. So, the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a slight miscalculation in beta. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute everything more precisely.

Let me recompute beta exactly. So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

m = 1.2 GeV, E =8 GeV.

So,

m² = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV²

E² = 64 GeV².

So, (m/E)^2 = 1.44 /64 = 0.0225.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.9887 as before.

So, back to L.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...

tau0 = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

gamma * tau0 = 6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = beta * c * (gamma tau0).

beta is 0.9887, so:

0.9887 * 1.37125e-23 s = 1.356e-23 s.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

1.356e-23 s * 3e8 m/s = 4.068e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.068e-15 m.

The options are:

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

So, the closest is B. But perhaps using more precise value of beta and tau?

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of beta. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.

Another approach: use the Taylor series expansion for sqrt(x) around x=1.

sqrt(1 - a) ≈ 1 - a/2 - a²/8 - a^3/16 ... for small a.

Wait, but a here is 0.0225, which is about 2.25% which isn't that small, so perhaps the expansion isn't very accurate.

Alternatively, use the Newton-Raphson method to find sqrt(0.9775).

Let me try that.

We want to find x such that x^2 = 0.9775.

Guess x0 = 0.9887.

Compute x0^2 = 0.97752769.

Compute f(x) = x^2 - 0.9775.

f(x0) = 0.97752769 - 0.9775 = 0.00002769.

f'(x) = 2x.

So, next approximation: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/(2x0).

x1 = 0.9887 - (0.00002769)/(2 * 0.9887).

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.9887 = 1.9774.

Compute numerator: 0.00002769.

So, delta = 0.00002769 / 1.9774 ≈ 1.400e-5.

x1 = 0.9887 - 0.000014 ≈ 0.988686.

So, x1 is 0.988686, so beta is approximately 0.988686.

Now, compute L with beta as 0.988686.

gamma * tau0 = 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply by beta: 0.988686 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

1.37125e-23 * 0.988686 = let's compute 1.37125 * 0.988686 = approximately 1.3568 (let me compute more accurately).

1.37125 * 0.988686:

= (1 * 0.988686) + (0.37125 * 0.988686)

= 0.988686 + (0.37125 * 0.988686).

Compute 0.37125 * 0.988686:

= 0.37125 * 0.988686 ≈ 0.3682.

So, total is approx 0.988686 + 0.3682 ≈ 1.3568.

So, 1.3568e-23 s.

Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 1.3568e-23 s = 4.0704e-15 m.

Hmm, that's 4.0704e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15. Close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the precise calculation of tau0.

Tau0 = ħ / Γ.

But ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So, tau0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that more accurately.

6.582 / 0.32 = ?

Compute 6.582 ÷ 0.32:

0.32 * 20 = 6.4.

6.582 -6.4 = 0.182.

0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.

So, total is 20.56875.

So, tau0 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

So, perhaps we need to include the exact value of beta.

Wait, perhaps using more precise value of beta, but it's already precise to six decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for lifetime, not just the approximation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (c * ħ) / (Γ * beta * gamma), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should derive the formula.

The proper lifetime is tau0 = hbar / Gamma.

The lifetime observed is tau = gamma * tau0.

The velocity is beta c.

So, the distance is L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau0.

Which is beta c gamma (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, that's another way to write it.

So, L = (beta c gamma hbar) / Gamma.

Hmm, but beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)), and gamma is E/(m c^2), but in units where c=1, gamma is E/m.

So, let's plug that in.

L = (beta c (E/(m)) hbar ) / Gamma.

But since E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c² (wait, no, in natural units, when c=1, m is GeV/c²? Or more precisely, in units where c=1, E and m have the same units.

Wait, perhaps to clarify, let's use units where c is not 1.

Wait, perhaps using natural units is complicating things. Let me try to approach it without relying on natural units, using SI units.

Wait, but all the given values are in GeV and MeV, which are energy units, so perhaps converting into SI units would be messy, but maybe necessary.

Alternative approach: Let's compute beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma is equal to (E/(m c^2)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ) = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute beta gamma as (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^0.5 / (m c^2), but perhaps I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps another way:

In natural units, c=1, so E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c^2, so gamma = E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, beta gamma = beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.66666667 ≈ 6.5911.

Wait, another approach: the decay length L = (c * tau0) * beta gamma.

So, c * tau0 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma: 6.5911 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 4.065e-15 m.

Ah, that's exactly option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Yes, now that's matching. So, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the energy of the particle,
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass of the particle,
- \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( \beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5911 \),
- \( c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \).

Thus:

\[
L = 6.5911 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
