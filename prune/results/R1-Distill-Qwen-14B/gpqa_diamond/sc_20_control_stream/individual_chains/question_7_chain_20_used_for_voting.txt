Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes would be limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. Oh right, this is about photon-photon interactions causing the gamma-rays to annihilate, thereby limiting how long they can exist in the universe. So the lifetime is determined by this process, which would mean that if the gamma-rays are too high energy, they annihilate quickly.

I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon (like CMB), the process's cross-section depends on the energy of the photons. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of the interaction happening. So higher cross-section means the process is more probable.

The CMB has an average photon energy of 10^-3 eV. Right, because the CMB is from the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its peak is in the microwave region, which corresponds to about that energy.

So the process is gamma + CMB photon -> electron-positron pair. For this to happen, the energy of the gamma photon must be high enough to meet the threshold energy required for pair production. The threshold energy is when the combined energy of the two photons equals the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since it's a pair, e+ and e-, the total rest energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So the combined energy of the two photons should be at least 1.022 MeV.

But wait, the CMB photon is low energy, 1e-3 eV, which is 1e-3 eV = 1e-6 MeV (since 1 MeV is 1e6 eV). So the gamma photon's energy E_gamma must be such that E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (2 E_cmb), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the condition for pair production from two photons is that the sum of their energies, when considered in the center of mass frame, must be at least twice the electron mass. Alternatively, the product of their energies must be greater than or equal to (m_e c^2)^2 divided by 4, because when both photons are moving towards each other, the condition is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 /4. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Wait, another approach: The threshold condition for pair production in photon-photon collisions. The energy of each photon in the center-of-momentum frame must be at least m_e c^2. So in the lab frame, where one photon (the CMB photon) is at rest (relatively), the condition is that the sum of their energies times the cosine of the angle between them, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For pair production, s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Let me think: For two photons colliding head-on, their momenta are opposite. So p1 = E1/(c) in one direction, p2 = E2/(c) in the opposite direction. So the total momentum is (E1 - E2)/(c) in one direction.

The invariant s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2 c^2/(c^2) ) because each photon's momentum is E/c. So (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [ (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ] = 4 E1 E2. So s = 4 E1 E2.

Wait, so s is (sum energy)^2 minus (vector sum of momentum times c)^2. So for two photons moving opposite, that would be (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 c^2. So expanding that:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

For pair production to occur, s must be ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, so the product of the two photon energies must be at least (m_e c^2)^2.

In this case, one photon is the CMB photon, E2 = 1e-3 eV. Let's calculate E1, the gamma-ray energy. So E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 511 keV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6 eV)^2 = 0.261 MeV^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

Wait, but E2 is 1e-3 eV. So E1 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Wait, E1 must be ≥ ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / E2.

So let's compute that.

(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 → 0.261e12 eV².

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So E1 ≥ (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, but that's 2.61e14 eV. Let's convert that to GeV.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. Oh, because 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV (since 1e9 eV is 1 GeV). Wait, 1e9 eV = 1 GeV. So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which would be 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, so 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, but wait! Did I make a mistake with the calculation?

Wait, (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV², right?

E1 = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) → 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV.

So that's approximately 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the problem is about the lifetime of the gamma-ray being limited by this annihilation process. So, when the gamma-ray's energy is higher than this threshold, they can annihilate via this process. So the energy E_gamma at which their lifetime is limited would be around this threshold energy.

But wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Another way: the condition for pair production from two photons is E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4. Or wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought the invariant s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Let me make sure.

Ah, right. For two photons to produce an electron-positron pair, the invariant s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (since they are moving in opposite directions). Wait, when the photons are moving in opposite directions, the momentum vectors are opposite. So p2 = -p2', so p1 + p2 = p1 - p2'?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of head-on collision. So photon 1 has energy E1, photon 2 has E2. Photon 1 is moving in +x, photon 2 in -x; so the momentum for photon 1 is p1 = E1/(c), and for photon 2, p2 = E2/(c) in the opposite direction. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

So the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1/(c) ) - (E2/(c) ) ) → (E1 - E2)/c.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2 → (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

So expand that:

(E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. And for pair production, s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So,

4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So E1 E2 must be at least (0.511 MeV)^2.

So for E2 = 1e-3 eV, which is 1e-6 MeV (since 1 MeV is 1e6 eV), E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-6 MeV) ) = (0.511^2) * 1e6 MeV^2 / MeV → 0.261 * 1e6 MeV.

Wait, 0.511 MeV squared is 0.261 MeV². Divided by 1e-6 MeV (since E2 is 1e-6 MeV), gives 0.261e6 MeV. Because 0.261 / (1e-6) = 0.261e6.

Wait, 0.261e6 MeV is 2.61e5 MeV. And since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, that's 2.61e5 MeV = 261e3 MeV = 261 GeV? Wait no, wait 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 2.61e5 MeV is 261e3 MeV = 261 GeV? No, wait, 2.61e5 is 261,000 MeV, which is 261,000 / 1000 = 261 GeV. Wait, but that doesn't match the earlier calculation.

Wait, no! Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me calculate step by step.

E2 = 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV (since 1 MeV = 1e6 eV, so 1e-3 eV is 1e-3 / 1e6 = 1e-9 MeV).

So E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-9 MeV ) → (0.511^2) * (MeV^2) / (1e-9 MeV) ) → 0.261 * MeV^2 / 1e-9 MeV → 0.261 * 1e9 MeV → 261e6 MeV.

Wait, 0.261 * 1e9 is 2.61e8. Wait, 0.261 * 1e9 MeV equals 2.61e8 MeV.

But 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 2.61e8 MeV is 2.61e5 GeV (since 1e8 / 1e3 = 1e5).

Ah, so that's 2.61e5 GeV. So that's approximately 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, which matches option C (2.6e5 GeV).

So the gamma-rays with energy above 2.6e5 GeV would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process. So the energy at which this happens is about 2.6e5 GeV, so the correct option is C.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold energy required for this interaction. The process involves a high-energy gamma-ray ($\gamma$) annihilating with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Threshold Energy for Pair Production**:  
   The invariant quantity $s$ for the photon-photon system must satisfy $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$, where $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$ is the rest energy of the electron. For two photons with energies $E_1$ (gamma-ray) and $E_2$ (CMB photon), moving head-on, the invariant $s$ is given by:
   \[
   s = 4E_1E_2
   \]
   Substituting $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$, we get:
   \[
   E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]

2. **CMB Photon Energy**:  
   The average photon energy of the CMB is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} = 10^{-6} \, \text{MeV}$.

3. **Solving for $E_1$**:  
   Using the threshold condition $E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2$, we solve for $E_1$:
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
   \]
   Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$ and $E_2 = 10^{-6} \, \text{MeV}$:
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511)^2 \times (10^6)^2}{10^{-6}} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Gamma-rays with energy $E_1 \geq 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ will have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons. This matches **Option C**.

### Final Answer:
The energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.

Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Wait, another approach: The threshold condition for pair production in photon-photon collisions. The energy of each photon in the center-of-momentum frame must be at least m_e c^2. So in the lab frame, where one photon (the CMB photon) is at rest (relatively), the condition is that the sum of their energies times the cosine of the angle between them, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For pair production, s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Let me think: For two photons colliding head-on, their momenta are opposite. So p1 = E1/(c) in one direction, p2 = E2/(c) in the opposite direction. So the total momentum is (E1 - E2)/(c) in one direction.

The invariant s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2 c^2/(c^2) ) because each photon's momentum is E/c. So (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [ (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ] = 4 E1 E2. So s = 4 E1 E2.

Wait, so s is (sum energy)^2 minus (vector sum of momentum times c)^2. So for two photons moving opposite, that would be (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 c^2. So expanding that:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

For pair production to occur, s must be ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, so the product of the two photon energies must be at least (m_e c^2)^2.

In this case, one photon is the CMB photon, E2 = 1e-3 eV. Let's calculate E1, the gamma-ray energy. So E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 511 keV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6 eV)^2 = 0.261 MeV^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

Wait, but E2 is 1e-3 eV. So E1 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Wait, E1 must be ≥ ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / E2.

So let's compute that.

(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 → 0.261e12 eV².

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So E1 ≥ (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, but that's 2.61e14 eV. Let's convert that to GeV.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. Oh, because 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV (since 1e9 eV is 1 GeV). Wait, 1e9 eV = 1 GeV. So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which would be 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, so 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, but wait! Did I make a mistake with the calculation?

Wait, (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV², right?

E1 = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) → 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV.

So that's approximately 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the problem is about the lifetime of the gamma-ray being limited by this annihilation process. So, when the gamma-ray's energy is higher than this threshold, they can annihilate via this process. So the energy E_gamma at which their lifetime is limited would be around this threshold energy.

But wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Another way: the condition for pair production from two photons is E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4. Or wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought the invariant s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Let me make sure.

Ah, right. For two photons to produce an electron-positron pair, the invariant s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (since they are moving in opposite directions). Wait, when the photons are moving in opposite directions, the momentum vectors are opposite. So p2 = -p2', so p1 + p2 = p1 - p2'?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of head-on collision. So photon 1 has energy E1, photon 2 has E2. Photon 1 is moving in +x, photon 2 in -x; so the momentum for photon 1 is p1 = E1/(c), and for photon 2, p2 = E2/(c) in the opposite direction. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

So the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1/(c) ) - (E2/(c) ) ) → (E1 - E2)/c.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2 → (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

So expand that:

(E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. And for pair production, s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So,

4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So E1 E2 must be at least (0.511 MeV)^2.

So for E2 = 1e-3 eV, which is 1e-6 MeV (since 1 MeV is 1e6 eV), E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-6 MeV) ) = (0.511^2) * 1e6 MeV^2 / MeV → 0.261 * 1e6 MeV.

Wait, 0.511 MeV squared is 0.261 MeV². Divided by 1e-6 MeV (since E2 is 1e-6 MeV), gives 0.261e6 MeV. Because 0.261 / (1e-6) = 0.261e6.

Wait, 0.261e6 MeV is 2.61e5 MeV. And since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, that's 2.61e5 MeV = 261e3 MeV = 261 GeV? Wait no, wait 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 2.61e5 MeV is 261e3 MeV = 261 GeV? No, wait, 2.61e5 is 261,000 MeV, which is 261,000 / 1000 = 261 GeV. Wait, but that doesn't match the earlier calculation.

Wait, no! Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me calculate step by step.

E2 = 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV (since 1 MeV = 1e6 eV, so 1e-3 eV is 1e-3 / 1e6 = 1e-9 MeV).

So E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-9 MeV ) → (0.511^2) * (MeV^2) / (1e-9 MeV) ) → 0.261 * MeV^2 / 1e-9 MeV → 0.261 * 1e9 MeV → 261e6 MeV.

Wait, 0.261 * 1e9 is 2.61e8. Wait, 0.261 * 1e9 MeV equals 2.61e8 MeV.

But 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 2.61e8 MeV is 2.61e5 GeV (since 1e8 / 1e3 = 1e5).

Ah, so that's 2.61e5 GeV. So that's approximately 2.6 × 1e5 GeV, which matches option C (2.6e5 GeV).

So the gamma-rays with energy above 2.6e5 GeV would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process. So the energy at which this happens is about 2.6e5 GeV, so the correct option is C.

### Key Analysis:

   \[
   s = 4E_1E_2

   Using the threshold condition $E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2$, we solve for $E_1$:
   \[

   \]
   Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$ and $E_2 = 10^{-6} \, \text{MeV}$:
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511)^2 \times (10^6)^2}{10^{-6}} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Gamma-rays with energy $E_1 \geq 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ will have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons. This matches **Option C**.

### Final Answer:
The energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.  
**Answer: C**
