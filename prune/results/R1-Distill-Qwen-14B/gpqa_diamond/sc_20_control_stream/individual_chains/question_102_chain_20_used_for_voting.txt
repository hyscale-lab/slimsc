Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene expression constructs and some imaging results. Let me try to unpack this step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with both ligand and receptor ORFs, and they're using Cre-lox for some sort of expression control. The experimenters are trying to visualize the expression using fluorescent markers, but they're not seeing the green signal. I need to figure out why.

Let me break down the setup first. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in the same transcript, but they're under different promoters or something. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So, the ligand's ORF is first, then the receptor.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites for Cre recombination. Cre will recognize loxP, and sometimes other lox variants, but I think lox2272 is a newer variant that maybe isn't recognized by wild-type Cre. Or maybe it's a different system.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so that should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor is under an IRES element, which is upstream. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can drive expression of a second gene in the same mRNA. So the construct is designed to express both ligand and receptor from a single transcript.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, which usually means two separate genes under separate promoters or in a way that allows for independent expression. Oh, but here it's a single transcript with two ORFs, so it's a polycistronic construct. The IRES would help in the receptor's expression after the ligand.

So, the setup uses Cre/LoxP to control expression. The idea is that in the presence of Cre, the lox sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes. For the ligand, the stop cassette is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So if Cre is present, it would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is between receptor and eGFP; Cre would remove that, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The ligand is under CBA promoter, so that part should be expressed regardless, right? But the stop cassette upstream of mCherry is loxP-based. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so mCherry isn't expressed. Then the IRES is for the receptor. So the receptor is under the control of the downstream region after the IRES. Hmm, not sure about that.

The experimenters transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in a Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin, which I think means the loading was correct. So the proteins are expressed because they detected them on Western. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but when they look under the microscope, they don't see the green signal (eGFP).

Wait, but in the mouse model, they're using a Cre line. They bred their construct into mice and crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, I think. So the SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells.

So, in the offspring, the Cre should recombine the lox sites. Let me thinkâ€”the ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter, so it's always expressed. But the mCherry is behind a loxP-stop-loxP. So in the presence of Cre, that stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the question is about eGFP.

For the receptor, the ORF is after the IRES. The IRES is a regulatory element that allows the ribosome to initiate translation of the second ORF. But the eGFP is after the receptor, with a lox2272 stop cassette. So if Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites but not others (like lox2272?), then the stop cassette would stay, preventing eGFP from being expressed. Or wait, does Cre recognize lox2272 as well? Or is the lox2272 for a different recombinase, maybe Flp?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. The loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites. Cre recognizes loxP sites. If the vector uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop cassette, then Cre wouldn't cut that. So the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says that the vector uses loxP for the ligand's stop and lox2272 for the receptor's stop. So when Cre is introduced, it would only remove the loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The lox2272 would not be affected, so the stop stays, preventing eGFP expression.

So in the mouse, when they cross with SOX10-Cre, Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So the ligand's stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop (lox2272) is not cut by Cre, so eGFP is not expressed. Hence, when they look for green (eGFP), they don't see it. So that's why there's no green signal.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, if the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the reading frame would be messed up, leading to a premature stop codon or no protein. But in the Western blot, they detected the proteins, so the receptors must be expressed. Hmm, but in the Western blot, they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is? Or maybe the Western blot isn't showing eGFP but the ligand perhaps.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question says that they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if they transfected the plasmid, both ligand and receptor would be expressed. Maybe in the Western, they saw the ligand (since the ligand is under CBA, it's expressed regardless), but the eGFP might not be because it's under the lox2272 stop.

Wait, but the eGFP is downstream of the receptor ORF. So the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would only be expressed if the stop is removed. Since the stop is lox2272, and Cre doesn't cut that, eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no signal. Because the eGFP is not being expressed.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop cassette wasn't removed. So the lox sites are different. So the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean the stop is in a different frame, but the issue is about the stop cassette not being removed, not about frame shifts. So D might not be the reason.

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so enhancers might not be the issue. Unless the construct doesn't have the correct regulatory elements. But the question says the Western blot showed signals, so the proteins are expressed.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent fluorescence, but why? The eGFP is a reporter; if it's stuck, then you wouldn't see the green. But why would it be stuck? Maybe the construct has a signal peptide preventing proper trafficking, but the question doesn't mention that. Plus, the Western blot detected the proteins, which suggests they are made and perhaps processed, including Golgi transit. But without knowing more, this is a possibility, but I think the more likely issue is the construct design.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they act on different cells. The question is about expression in the same cells. But the issue is about the eGFP not being expressed, which is about the construct, not their relationship.

So the main issue is with the lox sites. The ligand's stop uses loxP, which Cre can cut, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop uses lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal. So the reason is that the lox2272 isn't being cut by Cre, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be something about the lox sites not being compatible. But the options don't directly say that. Wait, the options given are:

A) ligand and receptor are in paracrine
B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi
C) enhancer missing
D) receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Wait, none of the options directly address the lox site issue. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different. The vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. So when Cre is introduced, it will only cut the loxP, not the lox2272. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

In the mouse model, the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, Cre is active in neural crest cells. The ligand's mCherry should be expressed, but the eGFP shouldn't. So when they look for eGFP, there's no signal.

So the reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't cut because it's flanked by lox2272, and Cre doesn't recognize that. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options again, none of them directly mention the lox sites. Hmm.

Wait another angle. The vector is bicistronic, with IRES between ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker system. Now, the mCherry is after a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, mCherry isn't expressed. The eGFP is after a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is in the mouse model, so Cre is present. But the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

So the answer would be that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox sites are different. But none of the options mention that.

Wait, looking back, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the reading frame is incorrect. But in the Western blot, they detected the proteins, which would imply that the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but without knowing about eGFP.

Wait, but the Western blot used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if eGFP isn't expressed, then the Western would detect the receptor (as it's expressed), but not eGFP. But the question says that the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is correct. So the proteins are expressed.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not the target of the antibody. The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, which would be the ligand and receptor. So the eGFP might not be detected on the Western. But the question states that after transfection, they used these antibodies. So the Western blot would show the presence of ligand and receptor, not eGFP.

But the question is about the mouse model. So in the mouse, the Cre is introduced, and the ligand's stop is removed. The receptor's stop isn't. So the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is expressed. But the eGFP isn't. So when they look for eGFP under the microscope, they don't see it.

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why? Because the stop isn't removed. Because the lox sites are different. So the reason is that the eGFP's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut.

But looking at the options, the only possible fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no. If they're not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the ORF is disrupted. But in this case, the stop is the issue.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The key is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut. So the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't made. So the problem is that the lox sites are different. But the options don't mention that.

Wait, the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop cassette isn't cut, then eGFP isn't expressed. So it's a construct design issue.

Looking at the options, which one relates to this? The only possible option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent eGFP expression. But that's about the ORF, not the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is in a different reading frame, so it's not translated. But why would that be the case?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand and receptor ORFs. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So ligand ORF is terminated, then mCherry is after a stop. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed along with the ligand.

The receptor is expressed from the IRES, and its ORF is followed by a stop in lox2272, then eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stop isn't removed (because Cre doesn't cut lox2272), so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but if the IRES drives the receptor expression, then the receptor is expressed regardless. But what about eGFP? It needs the stop to be removed. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand's expression is allowed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is active, but eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut.

So why? Because the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut.

Which would mean that the correct reason is that the lox sites are different, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Hmm. Let me think again. The eGFP is after the receptor. If the receptor is in the same frame, then eGFP would be expressed. If not, then the stop is in a different frame, but the stop is a stop. Wait, no: the lox sites are about the stop cassette. The stop is between receptor and eGFP, so if Cre isn't cutting it, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is with the lox sites, not the frame. So none of the options directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning, but the question says the Western blot shows proteins, so the ligand and receptor are being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is causing the receptor to be expressed, but the eGFP is not. But why? Because the stop is in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the Western blot showed that the proteins (ligand and receptor) are expressed, but the eGFP isn't because of the stop.

So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut, but none of the options reflect this.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand first, then the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under an IRES, which is weaker. The vector also has the stop cassettes for each reporter.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the stop cassettes are in the wrong place. For the ligand, the stop is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So when Cre cuts, mCherry is expressed as a fusion with the ligand? Or as separate?

No, Cre would remove the stop, so the ligand is expressed, and mCherry is expressed. But in the mouse model, the Cre would remove the stop, so mCherry is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed, so the problem is with the eGFP construct.

So the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed because its stop cassette isn't being cut by Cre. So the vector's design is such that the eGFP remains behind a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't cut. So when they look for eGFP, it's not present.

But the options don't mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design leads to the eGFP not being in the same frame, making the ORF incorrect. But if that's the case, the Western wouldn't detect the receptor either. Because the receptor's ORF is also in the same frame as eGFP.

Wait, the ORFs are for the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is in between, and the stop is not removed, then the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. So the problem is not frame but the stop.

Therefore, the issue is not about the frame but about the stop cassette not being cut. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But since we have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought. The vector has the ligand and receptor ORFs in a single transcript. The ligand is expressed with its own promoter, and the receptor with IRES. The stop cassettes are after each.

If the stop for eGFP isn't removed, then eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is the lox2272 isn't cut, which is a construct design issue. But the options don't state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is in the wrong orientation. Wait, but IRES works after the first ORF.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassettes don't flank correctly. For example, the lox sites aren't in the right order. But no, the question states that the ligand has loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option implies.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, which would prevent their expression as a single ORF. But the intended design is that the receptor and eGFP are separate. So that's not the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP is a tag on the receptor, maybe it's retained. But the construct has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP. So it's likely that eGFP is a separate tag. Or perhaps the eGFP is fused to the receptor. But the question says the receptor is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor-eGFP is a fusion protein. If that's the case, then the stop cassette would prevent the fusion's expression.

Wait, if the stop is between receptor and eGFP, then the fusion would not be made. Only the receptor would be expressed, without eGFP. So in that case, the eGFP would not be expressed as a separate entity, but the receptor is expressed. So in the Western, would the antibody against the receptor detect the fusion? If the stop cassette is not cut, then the fusion isn't made, so the receptor is expressed alone, without eGFP. So the Western would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP. But the question says the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is working, but not necessarily that eGFP is expressed.

So in the mouse model, Cre is present, but the stop cassette is lox2272, which isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue is that the lox sites are incompatible. But the options don't touch on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression vector is designed such that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but only the ligand's expression is under Cre control. Wait, no. The ligand's stop is under loxP, which is cut by Cre, allowing mCherry expression. The receptor's stop is under lox2272, which isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look for eGFP in the offspring, they don't see it because the stop wasn't cut. So the reason is about the lox sites being different, which isn't an option.

Wait, the only option that relates is D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot shows expression of the ligand (because it's under CBA) and the receptor (because IRES allows expression), but not eGFP. So in the mouse model, the Cre doesn't affect the receptor's eGFP expression because the stop isn't cut. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the possible reason is that the lox sites are incompatible, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. But the question says they're expressed in neural crest cells, so probably autocrine or in the same cells. Paracrine would mean they act on other cells, but that doesn't directly explain the lack of eGFP.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot showed the proteins, so the receptors are expressed. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette isn't cut, and hence the eGFP isn't made. So the answer is not listed, but I have to pick from the given options.

Wait, the only option that somewhat makes sense is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP isn't translated. But the Western blot would show the receptor, but perhaps not the eGFP. But in the mouse model, the receptor is expressed, so eGFP's absence is due to a frame issue. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is causing the issue, and that relates to the frame. But I don't think so. The stop is just a stop, regardless of the frame.

Hmm. I'm not entirely certain, but based on the options, the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if the ORF is not correctly aligned, eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the Western blot would not detect eGFP, but since the question says the signal is proportional to actin, perhaps they detected the receptor.

But wait, the Western blot detects the proteins, so if the receptors are expressed, as in the mouse model, then the antibody would pick them up. But the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the issue is the stop cassette, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic construct designed to express a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent markers (mCherry and eGFP) fused to the ligand and receptor, respectively. The construct uses loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes to control the expression of these fluorescent markers. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The experimenters introduced Cre recombinase via SOX10-Cre mice to recombine the loxP sites, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under the microscope.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.
   - Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites but not lox2272 sites. Therefore, the stop cassette for the ligand (loxP) would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. However, the stop cassette for the receptor (lox2272) would remain intact, preventing eGFP expression.

2. **Mouse Model**:
   - The offspring mice inherit the construct and are crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells.
   - In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop cassette (loxP) is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. However, the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272) is not removed, so eGFP remains unexpressed.

3. **Fluorescent Microscopy**:
   - The absence of a green signal (eGFP) is consistent with the construct design, as the lox2272 stop cassette prevents eGFP expression in the presence of Cre.

4. **Western Blot**:
   - The Western blot detected the overexpressed proteins, confirming that the ligand and receptor are expressed. However, eGFP is not detected because its expression is blocked by the unremoved stop cassette.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This option is irrelevant to the lack of eGFP expression, as the issue lies in the construct design, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor.
- **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: There is no evidence to support this. The lack of eGFP expression is due to the stop cassette, not trafficking issues.
- **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via the IRES element. There is no indication that enhancers are missing.
- **D) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**: This option suggests a frame issue, which would prevent eGFP expression. However, the primary issue is the lox2272 stop cassette, not the frame. The Western blot detected the receptor, indicating that the receptor ORF is intact.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 stop cassette is not removed by Cre. However, since this specific reason is not listed, the closest option is **D**, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene expression constructs and some imaging results. Let me try to unpack this step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with both ligand and receptor ORFs, and they're using Cre-lox for some sort of expression control. The experimenters are trying to visualize the expression using fluorescent markers, but they're not seeing the green signal. I need to figure out why.

Let me break down the setup first. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in the same transcript, but they're under different promoters or something. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So, the ligand's ORF is first, then the receptor.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites for Cre recombination. Cre will recognize loxP, and sometimes other lox variants, but I think lox2272 is a newer variant that maybe isn't recognized by wild-type Cre. Or maybe it's a different system.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so that should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor is under an IRES element, which is upstream. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can drive expression of a second gene in the same mRNA. So the construct is designed to express both ligand and receptor from a single transcript.

Oh, but here it's a single transcript with two ORFs, so it's a polycistronic construct. The IRES would help in the receptor's expression after the ligand.

So, the setup uses Cre/LoxP to control expression. The idea is that in the presence of Cre, the lox sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes. For the ligand, the stop cassette is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So if Cre is present, it would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed.

So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so mCherry isn't expressed. Then the IRES is for the receptor. So the receptor is under the control of the downstream region after the IRES. Hmm, not sure about that.

The experimenters transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in a Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin, which I think means the loading was correct. So the proteins are expressed because they detected them on Western. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but when they look under the microscope, they don't see the green signal (eGFP).

So in the presence of Cre, that stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the question is about eGFP.

For the receptor, the ORF is after the IRES. The IRES is a regulatory element that allows the ribosome to initiate translation of the second ORF. But the eGFP is after the receptor, with a lox2272 stop cassette. So if Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites but not others (like lox2272?), then the stop cassette would stay, preventing eGFP from being expressed. Or wait, does Cre recognize lox2272 as well? Or is the lox2272 for a different recombinase, maybe Flp?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. The loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites. Cre recognizes loxP sites. If the vector uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop cassette, then Cre wouldn't cut that. So the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says that the vector uses loxP for the ligand's stop and lox2272 for the receptor's stop. So when Cre is introduced, it would only remove the loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The lox2272 would not be affected, so the stop stays, preventing eGFP expression.

So in the mouse, when they cross with SOX10-Cre, Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So the ligand's stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop (lox2272) is not cut by Cre, so eGFP is not expressed. Hence, when they look for green (eGFP), they don't see it. So that's why there's no green signal.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, if the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the reading frame would be messed up, leading to a premature stop codon or no protein. But in the Western blot, they detected the proteins, so the receptors must be expressed. Hmm, but in the Western blot, they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins.

Maybe in the Western, they saw the ligand (since the ligand is under CBA, it's expressed regardless), but the eGFP might not be because it's under the lox2272 stop.

Wait, but the eGFP is downstream of the receptor ORF. So the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would only be expressed if the stop is removed. Since the stop is lox2272, and Cre doesn't cut that, eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no signal. Because the eGFP is not being expressed.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop cassette wasn't removed. So the lox sites are different. So the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean the stop is in a different frame, but the issue is about the stop cassette not being removed, not about frame shifts. So D might not be the reason.

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so enhancers might not be the issue. Unless the construct doesn't have the correct regulatory elements. But the question says the Western blot showed signals, so the proteins are expressed.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent fluorescence, but why? The eGFP is a reporter; if it's stuck, then you wouldn't see the green. But why would it be stuck? Maybe the construct has a signal peptide preventing proper trafficking, but the question doesn't mention that. Plus, the Western blot detected the proteins, which suggests they are made and perhaps processed, including Golgi transit. But without knowing more, this is a possibility, but I think the more likely issue is the construct design.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they act on different cells. The question is about expression in the same cells. But the issue is about the eGFP not being expressed, which is about the construct, not their relationship.

So the main issue is with the lox sites. The ligand's stop uses loxP, which Cre can cut, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop uses lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal. So the reason is that the lox2272 isn't being cut by Cre, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be something about the lox sites not being compatible. But the options don't directly say that. Wait, the options given are:

A) ligand and receptor are in paracrine
B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi
C) enhancer missing
D) receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Wait, none of the options directly address the lox site issue. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different. The vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. So when Cre is introduced, it will only cut the loxP, not the lox2272. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

In the mouse model, the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, Cre is active in neural crest cells. The ligand's mCherry should be expressed, but the eGFP shouldn't. So when they look for eGFP, there's no signal.

So the reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't cut because it's flanked by lox2272, and Cre doesn't recognize that. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options again, none of them directly mention the lox sites. Hmm.

Wait another angle. The vector is bicistronic, with IRES between ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker system. Now, the mCherry is after a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, mCherry isn't expressed. The eGFP is after a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is in the mouse model, so Cre is present. But the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

So the answer would be that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox sites are different. But none of the options mention that.

Wait, looking back, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the reading frame is incorrect. But in the Western blot, they detected the proteins, which would imply that the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but without knowing about eGFP.

Wait, but the Western blot used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if eGFP isn't expressed, then the Western would detect the receptor (as it's expressed), but not eGFP. But the question says that the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is correct. So the proteins are expressed.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not the target of the antibody. The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, which would be the ligand and receptor. So the eGFP might not be detected on the Western. But the question states that after transfection, they used these antibodies. So the Western blot would show the presence of ligand and receptor, not eGFP.

But the question is about the mouse model. So in the mouse, the Cre is introduced, and the ligand's stop is removed. The receptor's stop isn't. So the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is expressed. But the eGFP isn't. So when they look for eGFP under the microscope, they don't see it.

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why? Because the stop isn't removed. Because the lox sites are different. So the reason is that the eGFP's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut.

But looking at the options, the only possible fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no. If they're not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the ORF is disrupted. But in this case, the stop is the issue.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The key is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut. So the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't made. So the problem is that the lox sites are different. But the options don't mention that.

Wait, the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop cassette isn't cut, then eGFP isn't expressed. So it's a construct design issue.

Looking at the options, which one relates to this? The only possible option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent eGFP expression. But that's about the ORF, not the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is in a different reading frame, so it's not translated. But why would that be the case?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand and receptor ORFs. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So ligand ORF is terminated, then mCherry is after a stop. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed along with the ligand.

The receptor is expressed from the IRES, and its ORF is followed by a stop in lox2272, then eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stop isn't removed (because Cre doesn't cut lox2272), so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but if the IRES drives the receptor expression, then the receptor is expressed regardless. But what about eGFP? It needs the stop to be removed. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand's expression is allowed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is active, but eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut.

So why? Because the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut.

Which would mean that the correct reason is that the lox sites are different, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Hmm. Let me think again. The eGFP is after the receptor. If the receptor is in the same frame, then eGFP would be expressed. If not, then the stop is in a different frame, but the stop is a stop. Wait, no: the lox sites are about the stop cassette. The stop is between receptor and eGFP, so if Cre isn't cutting it, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is with the lox sites, not the frame. So none of the options directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning, but the question says the Western blot shows proteins, so the ligand and receptor are being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is causing the receptor to be expressed, but the eGFP is not. But why? Because the stop is in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the Western blot showed that the proteins (ligand and receptor) are expressed, but the eGFP isn't because of the stop.

So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut, but none of the options reflect this.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand first, then the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under an IRES, which is weaker. The vector also has the stop cassettes for each reporter.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the stop cassettes are in the wrong place. For the ligand, the stop is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So when Cre cuts, mCherry is expressed as a fusion with the ligand? Or as separate?

No, Cre would remove the stop, so the ligand is expressed, and mCherry is expressed. But in the mouse model, the Cre would remove the stop, so mCherry is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed, so the problem is with the eGFP construct.

So the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed because its stop cassette isn't being cut by Cre. So the vector's design is such that the eGFP remains behind a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't cut. So when they look for eGFP, it's not present.

But the options don't mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design leads to the eGFP not being in the same frame, making the ORF incorrect. But if that's the case, the Western wouldn't detect the receptor either. Because the receptor's ORF is also in the same frame as eGFP.

Wait, the ORFs are for the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is in between, and the stop is not removed, then the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. So the problem is not frame but the stop.

Therefore, the issue is not about the frame but about the stop cassette not being cut. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But since we have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought. The vector has the ligand and receptor ORFs in a single transcript. The ligand is expressed with its own promoter, and the receptor with IRES. The stop cassettes are after each.

If the stop for eGFP isn't removed, then eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is the lox2272 isn't cut, which is a construct design issue. But the options don't state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is in the wrong orientation. Wait, but IRES works after the first ORF.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassettes don't flank correctly. For example, the lox sites aren't in the right order. But no, the question states that the ligand has loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option implies.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, which would prevent their expression as a single ORF. But the intended design is that the receptor and eGFP are separate. So that's not the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP is a tag on the receptor, maybe it's retained. But the construct has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP. So it's likely that eGFP is a separate tag. Or perhaps the eGFP is fused to the receptor. But the question says the receptor is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor-eGFP is a fusion protein. If that's the case, then the stop cassette would prevent the fusion's expression.

Wait, if the stop is between receptor and eGFP, then the fusion would not be made. Only the receptor would be expressed, without eGFP. So in that case, the eGFP would not be expressed as a separate entity, but the receptor is expressed. So in the Western, would the antibody against the receptor detect the fusion? If the stop cassette is not cut, then the fusion isn't made, so the receptor is expressed alone, without eGFP. So the Western would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP. But the question says the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is working, but not necessarily that eGFP is expressed.

So in the mouse model, Cre is present, but the stop cassette is lox2272, which isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue is that the lox sites are incompatible. But the options don't touch on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression vector is designed such that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but only the ligand's expression is under Cre control. Wait, no. The ligand's stop is under loxP, which is cut by Cre, allowing mCherry expression. The receptor's stop is under lox2272, which isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look for eGFP in the offspring, they don't see it because the stop wasn't cut. So the reason is about the lox sites being different, which isn't an option.

Wait, the only option that relates is D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot shows expression of the ligand (because it's under CBA) and the receptor (because IRES allows expression), but not eGFP. So in the mouse model, the Cre doesn't affect the receptor's eGFP expression because the stop isn't cut. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the possible reason is that the lox sites are incompatible, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. But the question says they're expressed in neural crest cells, so probably autocrine or in the same cells. Paracrine would mean they act on other cells, but that doesn't directly explain the lack of eGFP.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot showed the proteins, so the receptors are expressed. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette isn't cut, and hence the eGFP isn't made. So the answer is not listed, but I have to pick from the given options.

Wait, the only option that somewhat makes sense is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP isn't translated. But the Western blot would show the receptor, but perhaps not the eGFP. But in the mouse model, the receptor is expressed, so eGFP's absence is due to a frame issue. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is causing the issue, and that relates to the frame. But I don't think so. The stop is just a stop, regardless of the frame.

Hmm. I'm not entirely certain, but based on the options, the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if the ORF is not correctly aligned, eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the Western blot would not detect eGFP, but since the question says the signal is proportional to actin, perhaps they detected the receptor.

But wait, the Western blot detects the proteins, so if the receptors are expressed, as in the mouse model, then the antibody would pick them up. But the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the issue is the stop cassette, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic construct designed to express a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent markers (mCherry and eGFP) fused to the ligand and receptor, respectively. The construct uses loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes to control the expression of these fluorescent markers. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The experimenters introduced Cre recombinase via SOX10-Cre mice to recombine the loxP sites, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under the microscope.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.
   - Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites but not lox2272 sites. Therefore, the stop cassette for the ligand (loxP) would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. However, the stop cassette for the receptor (lox2272) would remain intact, preventing eGFP expression.

2. **Mouse Model**:
   - The offspring mice inherit the construct and are crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells.
   - In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop cassette (loxP) is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. However, the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272) is not removed, so eGFP remains unexpressed.

3. **Fluorescent Microscopy**:
   - The absence of a green signal (eGFP) is consistent with the construct design, as the lox2272 stop cassette prevents eGFP expression in the presence of Cre.

4. **Western Blot**:
   - The Western blot detected the overexpressed proteins, confirming that the ligand and receptor are expressed. However, eGFP is not detected because its expression is blocked by the unremoved stop cassette.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This option is irrelevant to the lack of eGFP expression, as the issue lies in the construct design, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor.
- **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: There is no evidence to support this. The lack of eGFP expression is due to the stop cassette, not trafficking issues.
- **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via the IRES element. There is no indication that enhancers are missing.
- **D) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**: This option suggests a frame issue, which would prevent eGFP expression. However, the primary issue is the lox2272 stop cassette, not the frame. The Western blot detected the receptor, indicating that the receptor ORF is intact.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 stop cassette is not removed by Cre. However, since this specific reason is not listed, the closest option is **D**, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression.

Answer: D
