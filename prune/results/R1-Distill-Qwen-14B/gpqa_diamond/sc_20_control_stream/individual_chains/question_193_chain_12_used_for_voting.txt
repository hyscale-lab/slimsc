Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read through it again. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I need to find the relationship between N and r.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance d, right? So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So if I have a parallax, the distance is its reciprocal.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since d is 1/plx, I can substitute that in. Let's see, 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So I think I need to find the differential, like how much N changes as r (distance) changes by a small amount.

Hmm, if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be N times 4πd² dr, because the volume of a shell is 4πd² dr. But wait, the question is phrased as the number of stars per unit range of distance. So maybe just the gradient of N with respect to d?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of density. The number per unit volume is N divided by the volume. Or, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me approach this more carefully.

The number of stars N varies with parallax as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So as distance d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars goes up with distance to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So if you're looking at a small change in distance dr, the change in number of stars is the derivative of N with respect to d multiplied by dr.

So N = k * d^5, where k is the constant of proportionality. Then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So dN = 5k d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k d^4. But looking at the options, I don't see a 5, but perhaps the question is about the dependence, so the power of r (which is d) is 4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me double-check. The number N is proportional to d^5. So when d increases, the number of stars increases rapidly. But how does the number change as you move from one distance to a slightly farther one? That's the differential, which is dN = 5d^4 dr. So the change per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (per unit range) increases as r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The number of stars is proportional to d^5. So if I have two distances, d and d+dr, the number between those would be N(d+dr) - N(d) = k[(d+dr)^5 - d^5]. Expanding (d+dr)^5 using binomial expansion, it's approximately 5d^4 dr when dr is small. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k d^4, which is proportional to d^4. So the correct answer should be option C, which is r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). If \( N = k d^5 \) (where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} = 5k d^4
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance \( r \) (where \( r \) is the distance) increases as \( r^4 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \sim r^3 \)**  
**B) \( \sim r^5 \)**  
**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**  
**D) \( \sim r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
