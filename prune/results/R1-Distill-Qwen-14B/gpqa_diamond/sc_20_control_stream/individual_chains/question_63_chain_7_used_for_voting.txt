Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. Alright, so the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, right? The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says it's a diatomic molecule with atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So, the options are about the photon's momentum.

First, I think I need to understand the energy levels in this model. Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think corresponds to the ground state, both vibrationally and rotationally.

Wait, no. Or maybe the fundamental state is just the lowest vibrational state, but with the lowest rotational state? Or maybe the rotational and vibrational parts are treated separately. Oh, but the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both. But when you're in the fundamental state, maybe that's the lowest vibration (v=0) and the lowest rotation (J=0) state.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest state. What's the next state? Well, the next higher energy state would probably be the first excited state. But I'm not sure whether that's a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1).

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, wait, the non-rigid rotor is a bit different from the rigid rotor model. The rigid rotor is when the bond length doesn't change, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, which means that the moment of inertia isn't constant. Hmm, but how does that affect the energy transitions?

Alternatively, perhaps the model is combining both rotational and vibrational aspects, so the energy levels are a product of both. So the energy of the molecule is the sum of its rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but when moving from one state to another, the molecule can either change its rotational state, its vibrational state, or both. But the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we're looking for the transition that requires the least energy, which would correspond to the photon with the lowest possible energy (since energy is proportional to frequency and photons are quantized). Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the lowest energy transition possible, which might be the fundamental vibration or the first rotational change.

Wait, but in the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, the next possible state would involve the smallest energy increment. So what's the smallest possible energy change in this model?

Hmm. Let's think about the energy levels. The total energy of the molecule would be the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, or is the vibrational energy E_vib = h w (v + 1/2), right. So, for the fundamental state, v=0, so E_vib = (1/2) h w. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy, that would imply both v=0 and J=0. So the next state would be either v=1 or J=1.

But which transition would require less energy? Let's compute the energy differences.

The energy difference due to a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w (1 + 1/2) - (1/2 h w) ) = h w (1) = h w. So that's a change of h times w.

For the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1, the energy change is E_rot = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = B (2) - 0 = 2B. So ΔE_rot = 2B.

Which is smaller: h w or 2B? Let me compute B.

The rotational constant B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, B is equal to (h)/(8 π c I), but I might be mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8 π² I). Because I remember that B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), where k is Boltzmann's constant, but wait, no. Wait, think about the rotational energy levels formula.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2π). So substituting, E_rot = ( (h^2/(4 π²)) J (J+1) ) / (2 I) ) = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I).

So B is h²/(8 π² I), but sometimes B is written as h/(8 π² c I), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should just compute I first.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length.

So, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert that into kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let's compute that.

40/22 is about 1.818. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg. So I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me double-check the numbers:

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 π² I). Let me compute h squared. h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (8 π² * 1.2064e-46) )

Let me compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator is 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2064 is around 95.2 (since 78 * 1.2 is 93.6, 78 * 0.0064 is 0.499, so total around 94.099. Wait, exact calculation:

78.9568 * 1.2064 = let me compute 78.9568 * 1.2 = approx 94.748, and 78.9568 * 0.0064 ≈ 0.504. So total approximately 94.748 +0.504=95.252. So denominator is 95.252e-46 = 9.5252e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.5252e-45 ≈ approx 4.39e-67 / 9.5e-45 = let's see, 4.39 /9.5 ≈ 0.462, and 1e-67 /1e-45 =1e-22. So B ≈ 0.462e-22 = 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, 4.39e-67 divided by 9.5252e-45 is:

4.39 /9.5252 ≈ 0.4605.

1e-67 /1e-45 is 1e-22.

So 0.4605e-22 = 4.605e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

Now, the rotational energy change from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B [1(1+1) -0 ] = 2B = 2 *4.605e-23 = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but what about the vibrational energy change? Let's compute ΔE_vib.

ΔE_vib for v=0 to v=1 is h w (1) = h * 4e14 Hz.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So which is smaller, 9.21e-23 J (rotational) or 2.65e-19 J (vibrational)? Well, 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 2.6e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, but the question says, after the photon is absorbed, the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest increase in energy. So the photon's energy should be equal to the minimum energy difference between the fundamental state and the next higher state.

So the minimal energy difference is the rotational transition, so the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the problem is about the momentum of the photon. Because the options give momentum, not energy. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon that corresponds to the energy difference of 2B.

Wait, photons have energy E = h f, and also E = p c, where p is momentum. So since E = pc, p = E/(c).

So in this case, the photon's energy would be 2B = 9.21e-23 J. So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Wait, that's way smaller than the options given.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, Ns is kg m/s. So 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the vibrational transition instead. Because maybe the question is referring to a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, why? Maybe because the problem mentions the 'fundamental state', which in some contexts refers to the ground state of vibration (v=0), but the rotational state being higher.

Wait, but let's think again. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either v=1 or J=1. But which one of those transitions would require a lower energy?

Wait, earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. Because 9.21e-23 J is much less than 2.65e-19 J. So that would suggest the minimal photon energy is 9.21e-23 J, but that would give a momentum way too small for the options given.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in thinking about the possible transitions. Wait, perhaps the model combines both rotational and vibrational, so the next state could involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that complicates things, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecule being in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but any rotational state. So the fundamental state is v=0, but J could be any number. So the next state would be the next energy level, which could involve either a vibrational change (v=1) or a rotational change (J increases), whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but in that case, the minimal energy transition is the one with J=0 to J=1, which as we saw has a lower energy change than v=0 to v=1. So the photon energy is 2B, which is 9.21e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about the transition to the next higher state in either rotational or vibrational, but the first possible transition when the molecule is in the fundamental state. Oh, perhaps the fundamental state is the ground state with both v=0 and J=0. So the next state would have the minimal possible energy, which is either J=1 or v=1, whichever has a lower energy.

Wait, but from earlier, the energy required for J=1 is 9.2e-23 J, and for v=1 it's 2.65e-19 J, so the rotational transition is lower. So the photon's energy is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But then, the momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s. None of the options match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is about the photon causing a transition in which both the vibration and rotation change. But that's more complicated, and maybe the energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would make the energy even larger, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used is only the rotational model, and the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=1. Or maybe it's the vibration model, and the question is about the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1.

But the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, so probably considering both.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational photon's momentum.

So, E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 Hz = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options: option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is close to option A, but not exactly.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

h is 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value as per SI).

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon_vib = h w = 6.62607015e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.65042806e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83476e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

That's approximately 8.8e-28 N s. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is between A and D. Since 8.8 is approximately 9, which is about 4.9 times larger than option A (1.9e-28) and 6 times larger than option D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that the molecule is in the 'fundamental state' which is the ground state (v=0), but the next state could involve an increase in either J or v. But perhaps the problem is looking for the transition in the vibrational energy, not the rotational.

But why would the options not have 8.8e-28? Because none of the options are close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me re-calculate B.

I think I may have made an error in the calculation of I, the moment of inertia.

Wait, μ is the reduced mass. So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Then, converted to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10 m)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, B = h^2/(8 π² I).

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² is approx 78.9568.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (78.9568 * 1.2064e-46) )

Denominator: 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2064 = 95.25, so 95.25e-46 = 9.525e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.525e-45 = let's compute that.

4.39e-67 / 9.525e-45 = (4.39 / 9.525) ) * 1e-22 (since 1e-67 / 1e-45 is 1e-22).

4.39 divided by 9.525 is approximately 0.4608.

So B = 0.4608e-22 = 4.608e-23 J.

So rotational energy change ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = 9.216e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

Which is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, which would give a higher energy, but that's not matching the options either.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of w, but I don't see any given angular frequency for rotation. The given w is for vibration.

So perhaps the question is solely about the vibrational transition, and the rotational part is a red herring.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational excited state, v=1, because that's the next possible state, regardless of rotation.

But the energy for that is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the photon's energy being the vibrational transition, but considering the molecule as a diatomic undergoing both rotation and vibration, and the next state is the first state higher than the fundamental, which includes the rotational change, not the vibrational. Or perhaps the question considers the Raman active transitions, which involve rotational changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Earlier, the vibrational transition gives p≈8.8e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but four times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the energy transition is the combination of a vibrational and a rotational change. But that leads to higher energy, not lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, and the transition is the rotational transition. But earlier calculation gives a momentum way too small.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me re-express B in terms of the bond length and the rotational frequency. Wait, B is often expressed in terms of the rotational frequency, but maybe I should use another approach.

Wait, another formula for B is B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is the speed of light. Or wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me check the correct formula for the rotational energy levels.

Rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where ħ = h/(2 π).

So E_J = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = [h² (2)]/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I) ) = 2B, where B = h²/(8 π² I).

Wait, so that's correct.

Alternatively, B can be written as B = h/(8 π² c I), but I'm not so sure. No, that might be a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant is expressed in terms of cm^-1. The rotational constant B is also sometimes given in terms of wavenumbers, where B_rot = h/(8 π² c I).

Wait, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternative approach: perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated using the vibrational part, but I'm not getting the right number.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem expects me to compute the vibrational energy, and the photon's momentum is hbar * (w) / c, but that's not correct because E = h f = hbar w.

Wait, no, E_photon = h f = h w, since w is in rad/s and f is in Hz, and w = 2 pi f. So E = h (w/(2 pi)) )? Wait, no, E = h f = h (w / (2 pi)), which would be E = (h w) / (2 pi).

Wait, wait, because w is angular frequency (radians per second), f is frequency (Hz) = w/(2 pi).

So E_photon = h f = h w/(2 pi).

Wait, but earlier I used E = h w, which is incorrect. That might be the mistake.

Oh! Right! I think I made a critical mistake here. Because in the problem, w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is angular frequency (ω), not regular frequency (ν). So the correct energy is E = ħ ω.

Wait, because E = h ν, and ν = ω/(2 pi). So E = h (ω/(2 pi)) ) = (h/(2 pi)) ) * ω = ħ ω.

So, in the vibrational case, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h (w/(2 pi)) ) * (1 - 0) ) = ħ w.

So, ħ = h/(2 pi). So, E = (h/(2 pi)) * w.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J s) / (2 pi) ) * 4e14 rad/s.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 / (6.2832) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

Multiply by 4e14 rad/s: 1.054e-34 *4e14 = 4.216e-20 J.

So, E = 4.216e-20 J.

Then, the momentum p = E / c = 4.216e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.405e-28 kg m/s = 1.405e-28 N s.

Looking at the options: option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that's a match.

Wait, so earlier mistake was using E = h w instead of E = ħ w, because w is angular frequency.

So the correct calculation for the vibrational transition gives E_photon = ħ w, which is (h/(2 pi)) w.

So then, p = E_photon / c = (h w)/(2 pi c).

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J s,

w =4e14 rad/s,

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

E = (6.626e-34 *4e14 ) / (2 * pi ) = (2.6504e-19 ) / 6.2832 ≈ 4.216e-20 J.

p = 4.216e-20 /3e8 = 1.405e-28 kg m/s → 1.4e-28 N s.

Which matches option D.

So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state, likely with both vibrational quantum number \(v = 0\) and rotational quantum number \(J = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy would involve either a vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)). The energy difference for these transitions determines which requires the smallest photon energy.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)):**
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \(E_v = \hbar \omega (v + \frac{1}{2})\), where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\).
   - The energy difference for the transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = \frac{h}{2\pi} \omega
     \]
   - Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.216 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)):**
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \(E_J = B J (J+1)\), where \(B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I}\) and \(I = \mu R^2\) is the moment of inertia.
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8\pi^2 \times 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The energy difference for the transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The corresponding photon momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
     This value is far smaller than any of the given options, so the rotational transition is not relevant here.

### Conclusion:
The vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)) requires a photon with energy \(E = \hbar \omega\), and the corresponding momentum is approximately \(1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\). This matches option **D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. Alright, so the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, right? The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says it's a diatomic molecule with atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So, the options are about the photon's momentum.

First, I think I need to understand the energy levels in this model. Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think corresponds to the ground state, both vibrationally and rotationally.

Wait, no. Or maybe the fundamental state is just the lowest vibrational state, but with the lowest rotational state? Or maybe the rotational and vibrational parts are treated separately. Oh, but the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both. But when you're in the fundamental state, maybe that's the lowest vibration (v=0) and the lowest rotation (J=0) state.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest state. What's the next state? Well, the next higher energy state would probably be the first excited state. But I'm not sure whether that's a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1).

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, wait, the non-rigid rotor is a bit different from the rigid rotor model. The rigid rotor is when the bond length doesn't change, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, which means that the moment of inertia isn't constant. Hmm, but how does that affect the energy transitions?

Alternatively, perhaps the model is combining both rotational and vibrational aspects, so the energy levels are a product of both. So the energy of the molecule is the sum of its rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but when moving from one state to another, the molecule can either change its rotational state, its vibrational state, or both. But the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we're looking for the transition that requires the least energy, which would correspond to the photon with the lowest possible energy (since energy is proportional to frequency and photons are quantized). Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the lowest energy transition possible, which might be the fundamental vibration or the first rotational change.

Wait, but in the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, the next possible state would involve the smallest energy increment. So what's the smallest possible energy change in this model?

Hmm. Let's think about the energy levels. The total energy of the molecule would be the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, or is the vibrational energy E_vib = h w (v + 1/2), right. So, for the fundamental state, v=0, so E_vib = (1/2) h w. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy, that would imply both v=0 and J=0. So the next state would be either v=1 or J=1.

But which transition would require less energy? Let's compute the energy differences.

The energy difference due to a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w (1 + 1/2) - (1/2 h w) ) = h w (1) = h w. So that's a change of h times w.

For the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1, the energy change is E_rot = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = B (2) - 0 = 2B. So ΔE_rot = 2B.

Which is smaller: h w or 2B? Let me compute B.

The rotational constant B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, B is equal to (h)/(8 π c I), but I might be mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8 π² I). Because I remember that B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), where k is Boltzmann's constant, but wait, no. Wait, think about the rotational energy levels formula.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2π). So substituting, E_rot = ( (h^2/(4 π²)) J (J+1) ) / (2 I) ) = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I).

So B is h²/(8 π² I), but sometimes B is written as h/(8 π² c I), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should just compute I first.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length.

So, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert that into kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let's compute that.

40/22 is about 1.818. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg. So I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me double-check the numbers:

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 π² I). Let me compute h squared. h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (8 π² * 1.2064e-46) )

Let me compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator is 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2064 is around 95.2 (since 78 * 1.2 is 93.6, 78 * 0.0064 is 0.499, so total around 94.099. Wait, exact calculation:

78.9568 * 1.2064 = let me compute 78.9568 * 1.2 = approx 94.748, and 78.9568 * 0.0064 ≈ 0.504. So total approximately 94.748 +0.504=95.252. So denominator is 95.252e-46 = 9.5252e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.5252e-45 ≈ approx 4.39e-67 / 9.5e-45 = let's see, 4.39 /9.5 ≈ 0.462, and 1e-67 /1e-45 =1e-22. So B ≈ 0.462e-22 = 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, 4.39e-67 divided by 9.5252e-45 is:

4.39 /9.5252 ≈ 0.4605.

1e-67 /1e-45 is 1e-22.

So 0.4605e-22 = 4.605e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

Now, the rotational energy change from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B [1(1+1) -0 ] = 2B = 2 *4.605e-23 = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but what about the vibrational energy change? Let's compute ΔE_vib.

ΔE_vib for v=0 to v=1 is h w (1) = h * 4e14 Hz.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So which is smaller, 9.21e-23 J (rotational) or 2.65e-19 J (vibrational)? Well, 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 2.6e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, but the question says, after the photon is absorbed, the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest increase in energy. So the photon's energy should be equal to the minimum energy difference between the fundamental state and the next higher state.

So the minimal energy difference is the rotational transition, so the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the problem is about the momentum of the photon. Because the options give momentum, not energy. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon that corresponds to the energy difference of 2B.

Wait, photons have energy E = h f, and also E = p c, where p is momentum. So since E = pc, p = E/(c).

So in this case, the photon's energy would be 2B = 9.21e-23 J. So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Wait, that's way smaller than the options given.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, Ns is kg m/s. So 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the vibrational transition instead. Because maybe the question is referring to a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, why? Maybe because the problem mentions the 'fundamental state', which in some contexts refers to the ground state of vibration (v=0), but the rotational state being higher.

Wait, but let's think again. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either v=1 or J=1. But which one of those transitions would require a lower energy?

Wait, earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. Because 9.21e-23 J is much less than 2.65e-19 J. So that would suggest the minimal photon energy is 9.21e-23 J, but that would give a momentum way too small for the options given.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in thinking about the possible transitions. Wait, perhaps the model combines both rotational and vibrational, so the next state could involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that complicates things, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecule being in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but any rotational state. So the fundamental state is v=0, but J could be any number. So the next state would be the next energy level, which could involve either a vibrational change (v=1) or a rotational change (J increases), whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but in that case, the minimal energy transition is the one with J=0 to J=1, which as we saw has a lower energy change than v=0 to v=1. So the photon energy is 2B, which is 9.21e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about the transition to the next higher state in either rotational or vibrational, but the first possible transition when the molecule is in the fundamental state. Oh, perhaps the fundamental state is the ground state with both v=0 and J=0. So the next state would have the minimal possible energy, which is either J=1 or v=1, whichever has a lower energy.

Wait, but from earlier, the energy required for J=1 is 9.2e-23 J, and for v=1 it's 2.65e-19 J, so the rotational transition is lower. So the photon's energy is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But then, the momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s. None of the options match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is about the photon causing a transition in which both the vibration and rotation change. But that's more complicated, and maybe the energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would make the energy even larger, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used is only the rotational model, and the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=1. Or maybe it's the vibration model, and the question is about the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1.

But the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, so probably considering both.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational photon's momentum.

So, E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 Hz = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options: option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is close to option A, but not exactly.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

h is 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value as per SI).

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon_vib = h w = 6.62607015e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.65042806e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83476e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

That's approximately 8.8e-28 N s. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is between A and D. Since 8.8 is approximately 9, which is about 4.9 times larger than option A (1.9e-28) and 6 times larger than option D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that the molecule is in the 'fundamental state' which is the ground state (v=0), but the next state could involve an increase in either J or v. But perhaps the problem is looking for the transition in the vibrational energy, not the rotational.

But why would the options not have 8.8e-28? Because none of the options are close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me re-calculate B.

I think I may have made an error in the calculation of I, the moment of inertia.

Wait, μ is the reduced mass. So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Then, converted to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10 m)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, B = h^2/(8 π² I).

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² is approx 78.9568.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (78.9568 * 1.2064e-46) )

Denominator: 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2064 = 95.25, so 95.25e-46 = 9.525e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.525e-45 = let's compute that.

4.39e-67 / 9.525e-45 = (4.39 / 9.525) ) * 1e-22 (since 1e-67 / 1e-45 is 1e-22).

4.39 divided by 9.525 is approximately 0.4608.

So B = 0.4608e-22 = 4.608e-23 J.

So rotational energy change ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = 9.216e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

Which is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, which would give a higher energy, but that's not matching the options either.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of w, but I don't see any given angular frequency for rotation. The given w is for vibration.

So perhaps the question is solely about the vibrational transition, and the rotational part is a red herring.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational excited state, v=1, because that's the next possible state, regardless of rotation.

But the energy for that is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the photon's energy being the vibrational transition, but considering the molecule as a diatomic undergoing both rotation and vibration, and the next state is the first state higher than the fundamental, which includes the rotational change, not the vibrational. Or perhaps the question considers the Raman active transitions, which involve rotational changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Earlier, the vibrational transition gives p≈8.8e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but four times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the energy transition is the combination of a vibrational and a rotational change. But that leads to higher energy, not lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, and the transition is the rotational transition. But earlier calculation gives a momentum way too small.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me re-express B in terms of the bond length and the rotational frequency. Wait, B is often expressed in terms of the rotational frequency, but maybe I should use another approach.

Wait, another formula for B is B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is the speed of light. Or wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me check the correct formula for the rotational energy levels.

Rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where ħ = h/(2 π).

So E_J = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = [h² (2)]/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I) ) = 2B, where B = h²/(8 π² I).

Wait, so that's correct.

Alternatively, B can be written as B = h/(8 π² c I), but I'm not so sure. No, that might be a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant is expressed in terms of cm^-1. The rotational constant B is also sometimes given in terms of wavenumbers, where B_rot = h/(8 π² c I).

Wait, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternative approach: perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated using the vibrational part, but I'm not getting the right number.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem expects me to compute the vibrational energy, and the photon's momentum is hbar * (w) / c, but that's not correct because E = h f = hbar w.

Wait, no, E_photon = h f = h w, since w is in rad/s and f is in Hz, and w = 2 pi f. So E = h (w/(2 pi)) )? Wait, no, E = h f = h (w / (2 pi)), which would be E = (h w) / (2 pi).

Wait, wait, because w is angular frequency (radians per second), f is frequency (Hz) = w/(2 pi).

So E_photon = h f = h w/(2 pi).

Wait, but earlier I used E = h w, which is incorrect. That might be the mistake.

Oh! Right! I think I made a critical mistake here. Because in the problem, w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is angular frequency (ω), not regular frequency (ν). So the correct energy is E = ħ ω.

Wait, because E = h ν, and ν = ω/(2 pi). So E = h (ω/(2 pi)) ) = (h/(2 pi)) ) * ω = ħ ω.

So, in the vibrational case, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h (w/(2 pi)) ) * (1 - 0) ) = ħ w.

So, ħ = h/(2 pi). So, E = (h/(2 pi)) * w.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J s) / (2 pi) ) * 4e14 rad/s.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 / (6.2832) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

Multiply by 4e14 rad/s: 1.054e-34 *4e14 = 4.216e-20 J.

So, E = 4.216e-20 J.

Then, the momentum p = E / c = 4.216e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.405e-28 kg m/s = 1.405e-28 N s.

Looking at the options: option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that's a match.

Wait, so earlier mistake was using E = h w instead of E = ħ w, because w is angular frequency.

So the correct calculation for the vibrational transition gives E_photon = ħ w, which is (h/(2 pi)) w.

So then, p = E_photon / c = (h w)/(2 pi c).

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J s,

w =4e14 rad/s,

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

E = (6.626e-34 *4e14 ) / (2 * pi ) = (2.6504e-19 ) / 6.2832 ≈ 4.216e-20 J.

p = 4.216e-20 /3e8 = 1.405e-28 kg m/s → 1.4e-28 N s.

Which matches option D.

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state, likely with both vibrational quantum number \(v = 0\) and rotational quantum number \(J = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy would involve either a vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)). The energy difference for these transitions determines which requires the smallest photon energy.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)):**
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \(E_v = \hbar \omega (v + \frac{1}{2})\), where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\).
   - The energy difference for the transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = \frac{h}{2\pi} \omega
     \]
   - Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.216 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)):**
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \(E_J = B J (J+1)\), where \(B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I}\) and \(I = \mu R^2\) is the moment of inertia.
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8\pi^2 \times 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The energy difference for the transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The corresponding photon momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
     This value is far smaller than any of the given options, so the rotational transition is not relevant here.

### Conclusion:
The vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)) requires a photon with energy \(E = \hbar \omega\), and the corresponding momentum is approximately \(1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\). This matches option **D**.
