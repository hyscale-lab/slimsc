Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. The problem gives me some elemental abundance ratios determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2) and express that as a number.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. Hmm, log base 10 here, I think. 

Wait, I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, wait. Oh right, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to solar. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for example, if [Fe/H] is 0, that means the star has the same iron abundance as the Sun relative to hydrogen.

Let me jot down the given data:

Star_1:
Mass = 1.5 * Sun
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
[Fe/H]_1 = 0

Star_2:
Mass = 1.2 * Sun
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
[Mg/H]_2 = 0

Sun's data:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, so for the Sun:
nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH
nMg = 1e-5 * nH

But actually, since the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, that implies Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so same as the Sun. So Star_1's Fe abundance is same as the Sun's.

Wait, wait, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So nFe/nH = same as Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, meaning nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So, to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2.

I think the key here is to compute [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, and then relate them to find the [Si/H] of each, then get the ratio.

Wait, let's think about Star_1 first. Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe abundance same as Sun. [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → which means [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe, Star1) - log10(nSi/nFe, Sun) = 0.3.

Wait, the definition of [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] = 0.3, then n_X/n_Y = 10^{0.3} * (n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But since [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But wait, for the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe1 = 1e-4.5 * n_H1.

So, n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * n_Fe1 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun)] * n_Fe1.

But n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = (n_Si/nH)_sun / (n_Fe/nH)_sun.

Wait, from the Sun's data:
n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5)
n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-5)
But what about n_Si_sun? Wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm, maybe I can express it in terms of Mg/Si?

Wait, the Sun's data for Mg is given. The question provides [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 for Star_2. But for the Sun, I don't have [Mg/Si]. Wait, perhaps I need to find the Sun's [Mg/Si], but maybe I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? That's not given. Hmm, perhaps I can find it using the [Mg/Si] ratio for the Sun.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], since when taking ratios, it might cancel out.

Wait, let me think again. For Star_1, we have [Si/Fe]=0.3 and [Fe/H]=0.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So, substituting, n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun) ) * 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

= n_H1 * 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1 / n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, [Mg/H]_2=0.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log10(n_Mg2 /n_Si2) - log10(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) =0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun )

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2.

Substituting into the first equation:

n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

So,

(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2 = n_Si2 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

Divide both sides by n_Si2:

n_Mg_sun/(n_H_sun) * n_H2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

Cancel n_Mg_sun from both sides:

(1/n_H_sun) * n_H2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 / (n_Si_sun )

Multiply both sides by n_Si2:

(1/n_H_sun) * n_H2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun )

But wait, n_Si2 is what we're trying to find. Alternatively, perhaps I should express n_Si2 in terms of n_H2 and other known quantities.

Wait, let's see:

From the equation:

n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2 → 

(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

We can cancel n_Mg_sun from both sides:

(1/n_H_sun) * n_H2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3 / (n_Si_sun )

So,

n_Si2 = (n_H2 / n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )) 

But wait, we have:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

So, the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is:

(n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = [ (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) ) ]

Wait, let me write n_Si1 as:

n_Si1 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1 

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun ] / [ (n_Si_sun * n_H2 )/(10^0.3 * n_H_sun ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun ] * [10^0.3 * n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_sun * n_H2 ) ]

n_Si_sun cancels, n_H_sun cancels.

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (n_H1 ) / n_H2 )

= 10^(0.6) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

Hmm, so now I need to find (n_H1 / n_H2 ), but wait, how? Because I don't have any data on hydrogen abundance, but perhaps the mass of the stars can help.

Wait, the problem says the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But how does mass relate to the photospheric composition?

Wait, I think that the total number of particles (n_total) in the photosphere is roughly proportional to the mass of the star. But wait, that's perhaps not exactly correct. Alternatively, the mass is determined by the number of particles and their masses. But perhaps for a first approximation, the number of hydrogen nuclei (n_H) in the star's photosphere would be proportional to the star's mass, assuming similar composition.

Wait, but no, actually, that's not correct. The mass of the star is the sum of the masses of all the particles, not just the number of hydrogen nuclei. So that approach might not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the total number of hydrogen nuclei in the star is proportional to the star's mass, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that n_H is proportional to the mass, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the problem, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star are zero, meaning that their abundances relative to H are the same as the Sun. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2= n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

Wait, but what about [Si/H] for each star?

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, and [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Wait, wait, is [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]?

Wait, no, I think [X/Y] is equal to [X/H] - [Y/H]. Because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = (log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_Y/n_H)) ) - (log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) - log(n_Y_sun /n_H_sun)) )

= [log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun)] - [log(n_Y/n_H) - log(n_Y_sun/n_H_sun)]

= [X/H] - [Y/H]

So, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]

So for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and for Star_2, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

Which is log(n_Si1/n_H1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → log(n_Si2/n_H2) = -0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^0.3

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^-0.3

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si1/n_H1) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2 ) ]

= [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 1e0.3) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 1e-0.3) * n_H2 ) ]

n_Si_sun and n_H_sun cancel out.

= (1e0.3 * n_H1) / (1e-0.3 * n_H2 )

= (1e0.6) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

But wait, how to find n_H1 and n_H2? Because the problem doesn't give any data on H abundance. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of the stars is the same as the Sun's in terms of the number of protons? Because stars are mostly hydrogen, but wait, mass is a function of the number of particles times their mass. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the mass is proportional to the number of protons (n_H) in the photosphere.

Wait, the mass of the star is approximately equal to the mass of the hydrogen plus other elements, but if the star is similar to the Sun, perhaps the dominant component is hydrogen, so n_H is roughly proportional to the mass.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. If we assume that the number of hydrogen nuclei (n_H) is proportional to the mass, then n_H1 =1.5 * n_H_sun, and n_H2=1.2 * n_H_sun.

Wait, but is that a valid assumption? Because the Sun's photosphere is mostly H, so the Sun's mass is dominated by H. But a star with higher mass would have more H, but maybe in the same proportion. Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass. So, n_H1 = 1.5 * n_H_sun, and n_H2=1.2 * n_H_sun.

If that's the case, then n_H1/n_H2=1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

So, then:

n_Si1/n_Si2=1e0.6 * (1.25) 

Compute 1e0.6: 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 (since 10^0.6 = e^(0.6 ln10) ≈ e^(0.6*2.302585)=e^1.38155≈3.981 )

So 3.98 * 1.25 ≈ 4.975 ≈ ~5. But the options don't have this. Wait, options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the assumption that n_H is proportional to the star's mass might be incorrect. Because the mass isn't just the number of H atoms; each H atom has a mass of about 1.007 atomic mass units, but other elements have higher mass per atom.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't assume that. So maybe I need another approach.

Wait, from the Sun's data, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun, because that's needed for the calculations.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, and [Fe/H]_sun is 0. Also, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as [Mg/H]_sun =0. But wait, the question says [Mg/H]_2=0, but the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but for the Sun, [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/nFe) - log(n_Si_sun/nFe_sun) → which is [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/nFe_sun ) - log(n_Si_sun/nFe_sun) )=0. So, [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, implying that n_Si_sun /nFe_sun = n_Si_sun/(n_Si_sun / (nFe_sun/n_Si_sun )) → Wait, this is getting me confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun. Because for the Sun, [X/H]= log(n_X/nH) - log(n_X_sun/nH_sun) → but wait, the Sun's [X/H] is zero for X=Fe and X=Mg? No, that's not right. Wait, [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of X abundance relative to the Sun. If [X/H] is zero, it's solar abundance.

Wait, but in the problem, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given. Instead, the Sun's [Fe/H] isn't mentioned, but we have to look at the given values. Wait, let me recheck:

The problem states: "Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7."

So, this gives us log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? It's not given. So, perhaps I need to find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) → but we don't know this value. Alternatively, perhaps from the data provided, we can compute [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, from the Sun's nMg/nH and nFe/nH, but I don't have nSi/nH. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], because the [Si/H] terms might cancel out when taking the ratio.

Let me think again. From earlier, we have:

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't proceed. So maybe the key is to find n_H1 and n_H2 in terms of the Sun's.

Wait, but how? The problem doesn't give any data about hydrogen in the stars beyond the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero.

Wait, maybe the mass of the star relates to the number of Hydrogen atoms. Because the total number of Hydrogen atoms is roughly proportional to the mass, assuming similar composition. So, perhaps Star_1's mass is 1.5 times the Sun's, so n_H1 =1.5 * n_H_sun. Similarly, Star_2: n_H2=1.2 * n_H_sun.

So, n_H1/n_H2 =1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

Then,

n_Si1/n_Si2=1e0.6 *1.25 ≈ 3.98 *1.25≈4.975.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~3.9, but that's about 4. So why is this not matching any option?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

Earlier, I had:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (1e0.3 * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun * n_H1 ) / (n_Si_sun/(1e0.3) *n_H2/n_H_sun )

= [1e0.3 * n_H1 ] / [ (n_H2/(1e0.3) ) ]

= (1e0.3 *1e0.3) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 1e0.6 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

So, 1e0.6 is approximately 3.98, and n_H1/n_H2 is 1.5/1.2=1.25.

So, 3.98 *1.25=4.975.

But this is not one of the options. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, so 4.975 is close to 5, but the options don't have 5. However, option B is ~12.6, which is much higher. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the n_Si1/n_Si2 ratio.

Let me re-derive that.

Earlier, for Star_1:

n_Si1 = (10^0.3) * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1] / [ (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) ]

The n_Si_sun and n_H_sun terms cancel out.

= [10^0.3 *10^0.3 * n_H1 ] / n_H2

=10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Which is as before. So that seems correct.

But if n_H1/n_H2 is 1.5/1.2=1.25, then 1e0.6=3.98, 3.98*1.25≈4.975.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 5, but it's not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about n_H's relation to mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the star is the total mass, which is the sum of all the elements. So, the number of hydrogen atoms is approximately (mass of star) * (proton mass fraction) / (proton mass).

But this might complicate things. Or perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of hydrogen nuclei, which is roughly the same as the total number of particles in the star's photosphere.

Wait, perhaps another way: the problem doesn't provide any information about the actual number of hydrogen atoms in each star, so maybe I need to find the ratio without considering the mass.

Wait, but that can't be right because the ratio depends on n_H1 and n_H2, which are linked to mass.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the star doesn't affect the ratio of elements in the photosphere, because each star's photosphere has the same chemical composition as the Sun, except for the given abundance ratios.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0, so Star_1 has same Fe abundance as Sun. [Mg/H]_2=0, so Star_2 has same Mg as Sun.

But wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, which increases Si relative to Fe. And for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, which is Mg/Si ratio higher than solar by 0.3.

Wait, but the problem is to find the ratio of Si atoms between the two stars. So, perhaps I should compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then find the ratio.

Let me compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0.

So, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H] → 0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2: we can get from Star_2's [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H].

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3 and for Star_2 is -0.3.

So, the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 / (-0.3) = -1.

Wait, but that's a ratio of their [X/H] values. But to get the ratio of n_Si1 to n_Si2, we have:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2 )

= (10^[Si/H]_1 ) * (10^[Si/H]_2 )^{-1} * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Because n_Si1/n_H1 =10^{[Si/H]_1} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

Similarly, n_Si2/n_H2=10^{[Si/H]_2} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of [Si/H] and then take the ratio.

Wait, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun × 10^{[Si/H]_1} ) / (n_H_sun )

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun × 10^{[Si/H]_2} ) / (n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} × (n_H2 /n_H1 )

Because:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si_sun 10^{0.3}/n_H_sun) ] / [ (n_Si_sun 10^{-0.3}/n_H_sun) ) ] × (n_H2/n_H1 )

= (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) × (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 10^{0.6} × (n_H2/n_H1 )

But from earlier, n_H1/n_H2=1.25 → n_H2/n_H1=0.8.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2=10^{0.6} × 0.8 ≈3.98 ×0.8≈3.184.

Hmm, that's approximately 3.18, which is close to option A) ~3.9. But wait, 3.18 is not exactly 3.9. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, and 3.98 ×0.8 is about 3.184. So it's about 3.18, which is not exactly any of the options. The options are A) ~3.9, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about n_H. If the mass isn't directly proportional to n_H, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mass and assume that [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 determine the ratio directly, without considering the mass. Let's see:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} → 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is option A) ~3.9. So that's a possible approach.

But why would the mass be given then? Because the problem states that the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's, but perhaps in this problem, the mass doesn't affect the elemental ratios because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, implying that the overall H abundance is the same as the Sun, so the mass doesn't change the ratio of H in the photosphere. Wait, but that's not necessarily true unless the mass is dominated by H, which is often the case.

Wait, perhaps the mass is a red herring, and the correct approach is to compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 and find the ratio of their Si/H, which gives the ratio of Si atoms.

So:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

[Si/H]_2= -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

So, the ratio:

(n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 )= [10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}] × (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 10^{0.6} × (n_H2/n_H1 )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars, meaning n_H1/n_H2=1. So, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would the masses be given then? Oh, perhaps because the mass affects the number of H atoms, thus influencing the ratio. But without knowing the exact relation between mass and H abundance, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the mass and consider only the abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio using only the [Si/H] values, assuming that the mass cancels out because n_H is the same for both stars. But that doesn't make sense because the stars have different masses, so their total number of H atoms would be different.

Wait, perhaps the mass comes into play through the assumption that the total number of particles (H + others) is proportional to the star's mass. So, the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass. So, n_H1 =1.5 ×n_H_sun, n_H2=1.2 ×n_H_sun.

So, n_H2/n_H1= (1.2/1.5) = 0.8.

So, plugging back into the ratio:

n_Si1/n_Si2=10^{0.6} × 0.8 ≈3.98 ×0.8≈3.184.

Hmm, which is approximately 3.18, which is close to option A's 3.9, but not exactly. The closest option is A, but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating [Si/H]_2. Let me check again.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

[Mg/H]_2=0, so 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3. That's correct.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3 and [Si/H]_2= -0.3. So the difference is 0.6.

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{0.6} × (n_H2/n_H1 )

=10^0.6 × (1.2/1.5)

=3.98 ×0.8 =3.184.

Hmm. So the ratio is approximately 3.18, which isn't matching any option exactly. The closest is option A) ~3.9, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the [X/H] is defined differently. Let me recheck the definition.

[X/H] is log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X_sun/n_H_sun )

So, [X/H]_star = log(n_X star /n_H star ) - log(n_X sun /n_H sun )

So, [X/H]_star = log( (n_X star /n_H star ) / (n_X sun /n_H sun ) )

Which means, (n_X star /n_H star ) = (n_X sun /n_H sun ) ×10^{[X/H]_star}

So for Star_1:

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ×10^{0.3}

Star_2:

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ×10^{-0.3}

So, the ratio:

(n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) × (n_H2/n_Si2 )

= [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ×1e0.3) ] × [n_H2 / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ×1e-0.3) ) ]

= [1e0.3 ×n_H2 ] / [1e-0.3 ×n_H1 ]

= (1e0.6) × (n_H2/n_H1 )

Now, assuming that n_H is proportional to the star's mass, n_H1 =1.5 ×n_H_sun, n_H2=1.2 ×n_H_sun → n_H2/n_H1=1.2/1.5=0.8.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 =1e0.6 ×0.8 ≈3.98 ×0.8 ≈3.184.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mass and only consider the [Si/H] values, leading to 10^0.6≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relationship between [Mg/Si] and [Si/H].

Wait, let's try another approach without considering the mass.

Suppose the problem doesn't require the mass, and we can ignore it. Then,

n_Si1/n_Si2=10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^0.6≈3.98.

So the answer would be ~3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.

So perhaps the mass isn't needed, and the answer is option A.

But why was the mass given then? Maybe it's a distractor, or perhaps I'm overlooking something.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass affects the ratio of the number of elements, but perhaps I was supposed to consider that the total number of elements is proportional to the mass, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio of Si atoms regardless of H, but I think the approach I took is correct.

Given the options, the closest is A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the definitions of stellar abundance ratios. The problem provides the following key information:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: \(1.5 \, M_\odot\)
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\), \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\)

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: \(1.2 \, M_\odot\)
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\), \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\)

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = -4.5\)
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = -5\)

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Determine \([Si/H]\) for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  Using \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), we calculate:
  \[
  [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
  \]

- **Star_2**:
  Using \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\) and \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), we calculate:
  \[
  [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 \implies 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3
  \]

#### Step 2: Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The abundance ratio of silicon between the two stars is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
\]
Substituting \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

#### Step 3: Adjust for Hydrogen Abundance
The problem does not explicitly provide data on the hydrogen abundance in the stars. However, the masses of the stars (\(1.5 \, M_\odot\) for Star_1 and \(1.2 \, M_\odot\) for Star_2) suggest that the total number of hydrogen nuclei (\(n_H\)) is proportional to the star's mass. Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{H,1}}{n_{H,2}} = \frac{1.5}{1.2} = 1.25
\]

Incorporating this into the silicon abundance ratio:
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{H,2}}{n_{H,1}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{1}{1.25} \approx 3.98 \cdot 0.8 \approx 3.18
\]

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The calculated silicon abundance ratio (\(n_{Si,1}/n_{Si,2} \approx 3.18\)) is closest to option **A) ~3.9**. While the exact value is slightly lower, the problem likely assumes a simplified approach where the mass proportionality is ignored, leading to the direct use of \([Si/H]\) values to compute the ratio as \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. The problem gives me some elemental abundance ratios determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2) and express that as a number.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. Hmm, log base 10 here, I think. 

Wait, I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, wait. Oh right, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to solar. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for example, if [Fe/H] is 0, that means the star has the same iron abundance as the Sun relative to hydrogen.

Let me jot down the given data:

Star_1:
Mass = 1.5 * Sun
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
[Fe/H]_1 = 0

Star_2:
Mass = 1.2 * Sun
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
[Mg/H]_2 = 0

Sun's data:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, so for the Sun:
nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH
nMg = 1e-5 * nH

But actually, since the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, that implies Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so same as the Sun. So Star_1's Fe abundance is same as the Sun's.

Wait, wait, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So nFe/nH = same as Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, meaning nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So, to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2.

I think the key here is to compute [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, and then relate them to find the [Si/H] of each, then get the ratio.

Wait, let's think about Star_1 first. Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe abundance same as Sun. [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → which means [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe, Star1) - log10(nSi/nFe, Sun) = 0.3.

Wait, the definition of [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] = 0.3, then n_X/n_Y = 10^{0.3} * (n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But since [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But wait, for the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe1 = 1e-4.5 * n_H1.

So, n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * n_Fe1 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun)] * n_Fe1.

But n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = (n_Si/nH)_sun / (n_Fe/nH)_sun.

Wait, from the Sun's data:
n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5)
n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-5)
But what about n_Si_sun? Wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm, maybe I can express it in terms of Mg/Si?

Wait, the Sun's data for Mg is given. The question provides [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 for Star_2. But for the Sun, I don't have [Mg/Si]. Wait, perhaps I need to find the Sun's [Mg/Si], but maybe I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? That's not given. Hmm, perhaps I can find it using the [Mg/Si] ratio for the Sun.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], since when taking ratios, it might cancel out.

Wait, let me think again. For Star_1, we have [Si/Fe]=0.3 and [Fe/H]=0.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So, substituting, n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun) ) * 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

= n_H1 * 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1 / n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, [Mg/H]_2=0.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log10(n_Mg2 /n_Si2) - log10(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) =0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun )

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2.

Substituting into the first equation:

n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

So,

(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2 = n_Si2 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

Divide both sides by n_Si2:

n_Mg_sun/(n_H_sun) * n_H2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

Cancel n_Mg_sun from both sides:

(1/n_H_sun) * n_H2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 / (n_Si_sun )

Multiply both sides by n_Si2:

(1/n_H_sun) * n_H2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun )

But wait, n_Si2 is what we're trying to find. Alternatively, perhaps I should express n_Si2 in terms of n_H2 and other known quantities.

Wait, let's see:

From the equation:

n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2 → 

(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

We can cancel n_Mg_sun from both sides:

(1/n_H_sun) * n_H2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3 / (n_Si_sun )

So,

n_Si2 = (n_H2 / n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )) 

But wait, we have:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

So, the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is:

(n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = [ (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) ) ]

Wait, let me write n_Si1 as:

n_Si1 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1 

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun ] / [ (n_Si_sun * n_H2 )/(10^0.3 * n_H_sun ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun ] * [10^0.3 * n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_sun * n_H2 ) ]

n_Si_sun cancels, n_H_sun cancels.

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (n_H1 ) / n_H2 )

= 10^(0.6) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

Hmm, so now I need to find (n_H1 / n_H2 ), but wait, how? Because I don't have any data on hydrogen abundance, but perhaps the mass of the stars can help.

Wait, the problem says the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But how does mass relate to the photospheric composition?

Wait, I think that the total number of particles (n_total) in the photosphere is roughly proportional to the mass of the star. But wait, that's perhaps not exactly correct. Alternatively, the mass is determined by the number of particles and their masses. But perhaps for a first approximation, the number of hydrogen nuclei (n_H) in the star's photosphere would be proportional to the star's mass, assuming similar composition.

Wait, but no, actually, that's not correct. The mass of the star is the sum of the masses of all the particles, not just the number of hydrogen nuclei. So that approach might not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the total number of hydrogen nuclei in the star is proportional to the star's mass, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that n_H is proportional to the mass, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the problem, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star are zero, meaning that their abundances relative to H are the same as the Sun. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2= n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

Wait, but what about [Si/H] for each star?

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, and [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Wait, wait, is [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]?

Wait, no, I think [X/Y] is equal to [X/H] - [Y/H]. Because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = (log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_Y/n_H)) ) - (log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) - log(n_Y_sun /n_H_sun)) )

= [log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun)] - [log(n_Y/n_H) - log(n_Y_sun/n_H_sun)]

= [X/H] - [Y/H]

So, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]

So for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and for Star_2, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

Which is log(n_Si1/n_H1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → log(n_Si2/n_H2) = -0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^0.3

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^-0.3

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si1/n_H1) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2 ) ]

= [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 1e0.3) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 1e-0.3) * n_H2 ) ]

n_Si_sun and n_H_sun cancel out.

= (1e0.3 * n_H1) / (1e-0.3 * n_H2 )

= (1e0.6) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

But wait, how to find n_H1 and n_H2? Because the problem doesn't give any data on H abundance. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of the stars is the same as the Sun's in terms of the number of protons? Because stars are mostly hydrogen, but wait, mass is a function of the number of particles times their mass. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the mass is proportional to the number of protons (n_H) in the photosphere.

Wait, the mass of the star is approximately equal to the mass of the hydrogen plus other elements, but if the star is similar to the Sun, perhaps the dominant component is hydrogen, so n_H is roughly proportional to the mass.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. If we assume that the number of hydrogen nuclei (n_H) is proportional to the mass, then n_H1 =1.5 * n_H_sun, and n_H2=1.2 * n_H_sun.

Wait, but is that a valid assumption? Because the Sun's photosphere is mostly H, so the Sun's mass is dominated by H. But a star with higher mass would have more H, but maybe in the same proportion. Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass. So, n_H1 = 1.5 * n_H_sun, and n_H2=1.2 * n_H_sun.

If that's the case, then n_H1/n_H2=1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

So, then:

n_Si1/n_Si2=1e0.6 * (1.25) 

Compute 1e0.6: 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 (since 10^0.6 = e^(0.6 ln10) ≈ e^(0.6*2.302585)=e^1.38155≈3.981 )

So 3.98 * 1.25 ≈ 4.975 ≈ ~5. But the options don't have this. Wait, options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the assumption that n_H is proportional to the star's mass might be incorrect. Because the mass isn't just the number of H atoms; each H atom has a mass of about 1.007 atomic mass units, but other elements have higher mass per atom.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't assume that. So maybe I need another approach.

Wait, from the Sun's data, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun, because that's needed for the calculations.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, and [Fe/H]_sun is 0. Also, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as [Mg/H]_sun =0. But wait, the question says [Mg/H]_2=0, but the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but for the Sun, [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/nFe) - log(n_Si_sun/nFe_sun) → which is [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/nFe_sun ) - log(n_Si_sun/nFe_sun) )=0. So, [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, implying that n_Si_sun /nFe_sun = n_Si_sun/(n_Si_sun / (nFe_sun/n_Si_sun )) → Wait, this is getting me confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun. Because for the Sun, [X/H]= log(n_X/nH) - log(n_X_sun/nH_sun) → but wait, the Sun's [X/H] is zero for X=Fe and X=Mg? No, that's not right. Wait, [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of X abundance relative to the Sun. If [X/H] is zero, it's solar abundance.

Wait, but in the problem, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given. Instead, the Sun's [Fe/H] isn't mentioned, but we have to look at the given values. Wait, let me recheck:

The problem states: "Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7."

So, this gives us log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? It's not given. So, perhaps I need to find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) → but we don't know this value. Alternatively, perhaps from the data provided, we can compute [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, from the Sun's nMg/nH and nFe/nH, but I don't have nSi/nH. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], because the [Si/H] terms might cancel out when taking the ratio.

Let me think again. From earlier, we have:

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't proceed. So maybe the key is to find n_H1 and n_H2 in terms of the Sun's.

Wait, but how? The problem doesn't give any data about hydrogen in the stars beyond the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero.

Wait, maybe the mass of the star relates to the number of Hydrogen atoms. Because the total number of Hydrogen atoms is roughly proportional to the mass, assuming similar composition. So, perhaps Star_1's mass is 1.5 times the Sun's, so n_H1 =1.5 * n_H_sun. Similarly, Star_2: n_H2=1.2 * n_H_sun.

So, n_H1/n_H2 =1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

Then,

n_Si1/n_Si2=1e0.6 *1.25 ≈ 3.98 *1.25≈4.975.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~3.9, but that's about 4. So why is this not matching any option?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

Earlier, I had:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (1e0.3 * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun * n_H1 ) / (n_Si_sun/(1e0.3) *n_H2/n_H_sun )

= [1e0.3 * n_H1 ] / [ (n_H2/(1e0.3) ) ]

= (1e0.3 *1e0.3) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 1e0.6 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

So, 1e0.6 is approximately 3.98, and n_H1/n_H2 is 1.5/1.2=1.25.

So, 3.98 *1.25=4.975.

But this is not one of the options. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, so 4.975 is close to 5, but the options don't have 5. However, option B is ~12.6, which is much higher. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the n_Si1/n_Si2 ratio.

Let me re-derive that.

Earlier, for Star_1:

n_Si1 = (10^0.3) * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1] / [ (n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) ]

The n_Si_sun and n_H_sun terms cancel out.

= [10^0.3 *10^0.3 * n_H1 ] / n_H2

=10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Which is as before. So that seems correct.

But if n_H1/n_H2 is 1.5/1.2=1.25, then 1e0.6=3.98, 3.98*1.25≈4.975.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 5, but it's not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about n_H's relation to mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the star is the total mass, which is the sum of all the elements. So, the number of hydrogen atoms is approximately (mass of star) * (proton mass fraction) / (proton mass).

But this might complicate things. Or perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of hydrogen nuclei, which is roughly the same as the total number of particles in the star's photosphere.

Wait, perhaps another way: the problem doesn't provide any information about the actual number of hydrogen atoms in each star, so maybe I need to find the ratio without considering the mass.

Wait, but that can't be right because the ratio depends on n_H1 and n_H2, which are linked to mass.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the star doesn't affect the ratio of elements in the photosphere, because each star's photosphere has the same chemical composition as the Sun, except for the given abundance ratios.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0, so Star_1 has same Fe abundance as Sun. [Mg/H]_2=0, so Star_2 has same Mg as Sun.

But wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, which increases Si relative to Fe. And for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, which is Mg/Si ratio higher than solar by 0.3.

Wait, but the problem is to find the ratio of Si atoms between the two stars. So, perhaps I should compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then find the ratio.

Let me compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0.

So, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H] → 0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2: we can get from Star_2's [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H].

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3 and for Star_2 is -0.3.

So, the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 / (-0.3) = -1.

Wait, but that's a ratio of their [X/H] values. But to get the ratio of n_Si1 to n_Si2, we have:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2 )

= (10^[Si/H]_1 ) * (10^[Si/H]_2 )^{-1} * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Because n_Si1/n_H1 =10^{[Si/H]_1} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

Similarly, n_Si2/n_H2=10^{[Si/H]_2} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of [Si/H] and then take the ratio.

Wait, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun × 10^{[Si/H]_1} ) / (n_H_sun )

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun × 10^{[Si/H]_2} ) / (n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} × (n_H2 /n_H1 )

Because:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si_sun 10^{0.3}/n_H_sun) ] / [ (n_Si_sun 10^{-0.3}/n_H_sun) ) ] × (n_H2/n_H1 )

= (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) × (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 10^{0.6} × (n_H2/n_H1 )

But from earlier, n_H1/n_H2=1.25 → n_H2/n_H1=0.8.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2=10^{0.6} × 0.8 ≈3.98 ×0.8≈3.184.

Hmm, that's approximately 3.18, which is close to option A) ~3.9. But wait, 3.18 is not exactly 3.9. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, and 3.98 ×0.8 is about 3.184. So it's about 3.18, which is not exactly any of the options. The options are A) ~3.9, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about n_H. If the mass isn't directly proportional to n_H, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mass and assume that [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 determine the ratio directly, without considering the mass. Let's see:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} → 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is option A) ~3.9. So that's a possible approach.

But why would the mass be given then? Because the problem states that the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's, but perhaps in this problem, the mass doesn't affect the elemental ratios because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, implying that the overall H abundance is the same as the Sun, so the mass doesn't change the ratio of H in the photosphere. Wait, but that's not necessarily true unless the mass is dominated by H, which is often the case.

Wait, perhaps the mass is a red herring, and the correct approach is to compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 and find the ratio of their Si/H, which gives the ratio of Si atoms.

So:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

[Si/H]_2= -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

So, the ratio:

(n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 )= [10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}] × (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 10^{0.6} × (n_H2/n_H1 )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars, meaning n_H1/n_H2=1. So, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would the masses be given then? Oh, perhaps because the mass affects the number of H atoms, thus influencing the ratio. But without knowing the exact relation between mass and H abundance, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the mass and consider only the abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio using only the [Si/H] values, assuming that the mass cancels out because n_H is the same for both stars. But that doesn't make sense because the stars have different masses, so their total number of H atoms would be different.

Wait, perhaps the mass comes into play through the assumption that the total number of particles (H + others) is proportional to the star's mass. So, the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass. So, n_H1 =1.5 ×n_H_sun, n_H2=1.2 ×n_H_sun.

So, n_H2/n_H1= (1.2/1.5) = 0.8.

So, plugging back into the ratio:

n_Si1/n_Si2=10^{0.6} × 0.8 ≈3.98 ×0.8≈3.184.

Hmm, which is approximately 3.18, which is close to option A's 3.9, but not exactly. The closest option is A, but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating [Si/H]_2. Let me check again.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

[Mg/H]_2=0, so 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3. That's correct.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3 and [Si/H]_2= -0.3. So the difference is 0.6.

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{0.6} × (n_H2/n_H1 )

=10^0.6 × (1.2/1.5)

=3.98 ×0.8 =3.184.

Hmm. So the ratio is approximately 3.18, which isn't matching any option exactly. The closest is option A) ~3.9, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the [X/H] is defined differently. Let me recheck the definition.

[X/H] is log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X_sun/n_H_sun )

So, [X/H]_star = log(n_X star /n_H star ) - log(n_X sun /n_H sun )

So, [X/H]_star = log( (n_X star /n_H star ) / (n_X sun /n_H sun ) )

Which means, (n_X star /n_H star ) = (n_X sun /n_H sun ) ×10^{[X/H]_star}

So for Star_1:

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ×10^{0.3}

Star_2:

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ×10^{-0.3}

So, the ratio:

(n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) × (n_H2/n_Si2 )

= [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ×1e0.3) ] × [n_H2 / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ×1e-0.3) ) ]

= [1e0.3 ×n_H2 ] / [1e-0.3 ×n_H1 ]

= (1e0.6) × (n_H2/n_H1 )

Now, assuming that n_H is proportional to the star's mass, n_H1 =1.5 ×n_H_sun, n_H2=1.2 ×n_H_sun → n_H2/n_H1=1.2/1.5=0.8.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 =1e0.6 ×0.8 ≈3.98 ×0.8 ≈3.184.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mass and only consider the [Si/H] values, leading to 10^0.6≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relationship between [Mg/Si] and [Si/H].

Wait, let's try another approach without considering the mass.

Suppose the problem doesn't require the mass, and we can ignore it. Then,

n_Si1/n_Si2=10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^0.6≈3.98.

So the answer would be ~3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.

So perhaps the mass isn't needed, and the answer is option A.

But why was the mass given then? Maybe it's a distractor, or perhaps I'm overlooking something.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass affects the ratio of the number of elements, but perhaps I was supposed to consider that the total number of elements is proportional to the mass, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio of Si atoms regardless of H, but I think the approach I took is correct.

Given the options, the closest is A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the definitions of stellar abundance ratios. The problem provides the following key information:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: \(1.5 \, M_\odot\)
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\), \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\)

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: \(1.2 \, M_\odot\)
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\), \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\)

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = -4.5\)
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = -5\)

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Determine \([Si/H]\) for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  Using \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), we calculate:
  \[
  [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
  \]

- **Star_2**:
  Using \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\) and \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), we calculate:
  \[
  [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 \implies 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3
  \]

#### Step 2: Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The abundance ratio of silicon between the two stars is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
\]
Substituting \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

#### Step 3: Adjust for Hydrogen Abundance
The problem does not explicitly provide data on the hydrogen abundance in the stars. However, the masses of the stars (\(1.5 \, M_\odot\) for Star_1 and \(1.2 \, M_\odot\) for Star_2) suggest that the total number of hydrogen nuclei (\(n_H\)) is proportional to the star's mass. Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{H,1}}{n_{H,2}} = \frac{1.5}{1.2} = 1.25
\]

Incorporating this into the silicon abundance ratio:
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{H,2}}{n_{H,1}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{1}{1.25} \approx 3.98 \cdot 0.8 \approx 3.18
\]

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The calculated silicon abundance ratio (\(n_{Si,1}/n_{Si,2} \approx 3.18\)) is closest to option **A) ~3.9**. While the exact value is slightly lower, the problem likely assumes a simplified approach where the mass proportionality is ignored, leading to the direct use of \([Si/H]\) values to compute the ratio as \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
