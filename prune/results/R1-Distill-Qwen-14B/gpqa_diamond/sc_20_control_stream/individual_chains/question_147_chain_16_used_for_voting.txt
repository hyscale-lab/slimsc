Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is p + p-bar → 2A+ + 2A−. Oh wait, wait, the question says the antiproton is moving slowly. So, the initial setup is a proton and an antiproton annihilating, producing four particles: two A+ and two A−. 

I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can assume that its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton's velocity is low, so maybe its kinetic energy isn't too significant, or perhaps it's non-relativistic? Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, the given data says m_A c² is 300 MeV. But wait, the proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton's same as the proton's because they're each other's antiparticles. So, each has rest mass energy around 938 MeV. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is small, but not sure yet.

Wait, the process is p + p-bar → 2A+ + 2A−. So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are the same, but the antiproton is moving, while the proton might be at rest or moving as well. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Or maybe both are moving? Hmm, I might have to make an assumption here.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is "slowly" moving. So perhaps its velocity is much less than the speed of light, meaning we can treat it as non-relativistic. But wait, let me think about how that applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial total energy is the sum of the rest energy of the proton plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is small, so the total energy is roughly 2m_p c² (since the proton is also at rest, and the antiproton's energy is about m_p c² plus a small KE). But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is likely at rest, and the antiproton is moving. So the initial momentum is all from the antiproton. After the annihilation, the four particles (two A+ and two A-) are produced. Since the process is p + p-bar annihilating into these four particles, the products are likely at some velocity v.

But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find v. 

Hmm, but what do I know? The rest mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. So m_A c² = 300 MeV, so m_A is about 300 MeV/c². 

Wait, but the initial particles, the proton and antiproton, have rest mass energies of 938 MeV each. So their combined rest mass is 1876 MeV. But since the antiproton is moving, the total energy is higher than that. So the annihilation produces particles with a total energy higher than 1876 MeV, but I don't know the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the kinetic energy is negligible, so the initial energy is approximately 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. Alternatively, maybe we can ignore the kinetic energy of the antiproton because it's moving slowly. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which might imply that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So, its total energy is approximately m_p c² plus a small KE. But maybe for this problem, the exact KE is negligible, so the initial energy is about 2 m_p c².

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is significant. Because the antiproton is moving, the initial momentum is (gamma m_p v) in the direction of motion, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. But if it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so initial momentum is m_p v.

Wait, but after annihilation, we have four particles. Let's consider the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but maybe it's easier to consider the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. 

Wait, but in the initial state, the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is gamma * m_p * v in the opposite direction (since it's moving towards the proton). So the total initial momentum is gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, the products (four A particles) must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum, which is gamma m_p v. So the total momentum of the four As is gamma m_p v.

But each A has rest mass 300 MeV/c². So, each A has some velocity, and we have to find what that velocity is.

Wait, but the problem states that the products are two A+ and two A−. Are they moving in some symmetric way, maybe in pairs? Like, perhaps two pairs moving in opposite directions, so that the total momentum vectors add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, maybe all four particles are moving in the same direction, but that would complicate things. So perhaps the products are moving in two pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions with some velocity.

Wait, maybe it's simpler to assume that all four particles are moving together with the same velocity. But that might not be correct because the problem doesn't specify their velocities. Hmm, but perhaps due to symmetry, they move in such a way that the total momentum is the same as the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles move symmetrically, so that each pair is moving in opposite directions, but with the same speed. So, if each pair has the same speed but opposite directions, their individual momentum vectors would add up, but perhaps the total is the same as the initial.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as the four particles moving in two opposite directions, each with a certain speed. But maybe it's easier to consider the system's total energy and momentum.

Wait, let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial system has energy E_initial = m_p c² (proton at rest) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton), and initial momentum p_initial = gamma m_p v (since the proton is at rest, the antiproton's momentum is all there is).

After annihilation, the system consists of four particles each of mass m_A. So, each has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for particle A's velocity, which is what we're trying to find.

The total energy after is 4 gamma_A m_A c². The total momentum after is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A, assuming all A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum. But wait, that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe two are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, and two in the opposite, but that complicates things. Or perhaps all four are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, so the total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Wait, but that would make the momentum conservation equation: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

Energy conservation: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma m_p) c².

Wait, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton rest) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton's energy). So E_initial = m_p c² (1 + gamma). 

So, putting it together: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

Divide both sides by c²: 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

Hmm, but we have two equations:

1. 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

2. 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

Wait, but I don't know what gamma is for the antiproton. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). But perhaps for this problem, we can approximate gamma as 1 because v is small. But wait, if the antiproton is moving, even slowly, then gamma is slightly larger than 1. But without knowing v, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible compared to the rest mass terms, but I don't think so because the antiproton is moving, so momentum might not be negligible.

Wait, but maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the initial momentum is negligible, which would only be the case if the antiproton isn't moving, but the problem says it's moving slowly, so that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: If the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can treat the process as approximately non-relativistic. So, the initial kinetic energy is low, so the total energy is approximately the sum of the rest masses.

Wait, the initial energy would be E_initial ≈ (m_p + m_p)c² = 2 m_p c². Because the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. So, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

After annihilation, the total energy of the products is 4 gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is for each A particle.

So, energy conservation: 4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Divide both sides by c²: 4 gamma_A m_A = 2 m_p.

So, gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Given that m_p c² is about 938 MeV, and m_A c² is 300 MeV, so m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So, gamma_A = (938) / (2 * 300) ) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma_A is about 1.563. Now, we can find the velocity v_A using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).

Let me compute v for gamma = 1.563.

Let me compute beta = v/c.

gamma = 1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So, 1/gamma² = 1 - beta².

gamma² = (1.563)^2 ≈ 2.443.

1/gamma² ≈ 0.409.

So, 0.409 = 1 - beta^2 --> beta^2 = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591.

So beta = sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769.

So v ≈ 0.769 c. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made an approximation that the initial KE is negligible, but what if that's not the case?

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps it's supposed to be treated as non-relativistic, but I might have ignored some terms.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my energy conservation assumption. I assumed E_initial is approximately 2 m_p c², but that's only if the antiproton's KE is negligible. But in reality, the antiproton's KE is not zero, but since it's moving slowly, perhaps we can consider that the total initial energy is 2 m_p c² plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But without knowing the KE, maybe it's impossible to proceed, unless the KE is considered to be negligible.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the initial momentum is small, so the kinetic energy of the antiproton is (p²)/(2 m_p), but since p is small, KE is small. But how to get the exact value?

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed using exact relativistic equations, not making any approximations.

Let me try that.

The initial system has a proton at rest and an antiproton moving with velocity v. So, the proton's energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c², where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, total initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Total initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v (since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero, and the antiproton's momentum is gamma m_p v).

After annihilation, the four A particles are produced. Let's denote each A has mass m_A and velocity u. Let's assume they all move in the same direction as the initial momentum, so their momenta add up.

So, total momentum after is 4 gamma_A m_A u = p_initial = gamma m_p v.

Total energy after: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

So, we have two equations:

1. 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.

2. 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

Hmm, but gamma_A is 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²). So, that's a bit complicated.

Let me try to eliminate variables. Let me divide equation 1 by equation 2 to eliminate some terms.

Equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.

Equation 2: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p (1 + gamma) c².

Divide equation 1 by equation 2:

(4 gamma_A m_A u) / (4 gamma_A m_A c²) ) = (gamma m_p v) / ( m_p (1 + gamma) c² )

Simplify left side: u/(c²) = (gamma v) / ( (1 + gamma) c² )

Multiply both sides by c²: u = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma )

Hmm, so u = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is greater than 1.

Wait, but without knowing the value of v, it's hard to proceed. So perhaps I can make another substitution or find another equation.

Wait, let's take the ratio of equations.

From equation 2: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

Divide both sides by m_p c²: 4 gamma_A m_A / m_p = (1 + gamma )

So, 4 gamma_A (300 MeV/c²) / (938 MeV/c²) ) = 1 + gamma.

So, 4 gamma_A (300/938) = 1 + gamma.

So, 4 * 300/938 ≈ 4 * 0.3196 ≈ 1.2784.

So, 1.2784 gamma_A ≈ 1 + gamma.

But gamma is also for the antiproton's motion. Hmm, perhaps I can express gamma in terms of v and then relate u to v.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let's think about the initial momentum and energy.

Wait, perhaps I can write both equations in terms of u and v, then find a relation between u and v.

Hmm, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocity u is a significant fraction of c, making gamma_A not too large. Let's see.

Wait, from equation 2: 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

So, substituting m_A = 300 MeV/c² and m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So, 4 gamma_A *300 = 938 (1 + gamma).

So, 1200 gamma_A = 938 (1 + gamma).

Divide both sides by 938: 1200/938 gamma_A ≈ (1 + gamma).

1200/938 ≈ 1.281.

So, 1.281 gamma_A ≈ 1 + gamma.

Now, from equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.

Substituting m_A = 300, m_p =938.

4 gamma_A *300 u = gamma *938 v.

Which is 1200 gamma_A u = 938 gamma v.

Divide both sides by 938: (1200/938) gamma_A u = gamma v.

1200/938 ≈1.281, so:

1.281 gamma_A u = gamma v.

But from earlier, gamma_A ≈ (1 + gamma)/(1.281).

So substituting into this equation:

1.281 * ( (1 + gamma)/(1.281) ) * u = gamma v.

Simplify: (1 + gamma ) u = gamma v.

So, u = [ gamma/(1 + gamma) ] v.

Hmm, interesting. So, u is a fraction of v, specifically u = [ gamma/(1 + gamma) ] v.

But beta, the velocity of the antiproton, is v/c, and beta_A = u/c.

So, beta_A = [ gamma/(1 + gamma) ] beta.

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, beta_A = [ 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2) (1 + 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)) ) ] beta.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should make a substitution for beta, such as letting x = beta.

Wait, but perhaps I can find another relation.

Wait, from equation 2, 1.281 gamma_A = 1 + gamma.

And from equation 1, after substitution, we have:

(1 + gamma) u = gamma v.

Which is: (1 + gamma) (u) = gamma v.

But u = beta_A c, and v = beta c.

So, (1 + gamma) beta_A c = gamma beta c.

Divide both sides by c:

(1 + gamma) beta_A = gamma beta.

So, beta_A = (gamma/(1 + gamma)) beta.

Hmm, perhaps I can write beta_A in terms of beta.

But I'm not sure where this leads. Maybe I can square both sides to make use of the relation gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2).

Wait, beta_A = [gamma/(1 + gamma)] beta.

Let me square both sides:

beta_A² = [gamma²/(1 + gamma)^2 ] beta².

But beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So,

beta_A² = [gamma²/(1 + gamma)^2 ] (1 - 1/gamma² )

= [gamma²/( (1 + gamma)^2 ) ] ( (gamma² - 1)/gamma² )

= (gamma² -1) / ( (1 + gamma)^2 )

= (gamma² -1) / ( (gamma +1)^2 )

But gamma² -1 = (gamma-1)(gamma+1), so:

(gamma² -1) = (gamma-1)(gamma+1).

So,

beta_A² = (gamma-1)(gamma+1) ) / ( (gamma+1)^2 ) )

= (gamma-1)/(gamma+1)

So, beta_A² = (gamma - 1)/(gamma + 1)

Taking square roots:

beta_A = sqrt( (gamma-1)/(gamma +1) )

Hmm, that's a useful relation.

Wait, now from equation 2, we have 1.281 gamma_A = 1 + gamma.

But gamma_A is 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2).

So, let's compute gamma_A.

gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ) = 1/sqrt( 1 - (gamma-1)/(gamma+1) ) ).

Hmm, let me compute 1 - (gamma-1)/(gamma+1):

1 = (gamma +1)/(gamma +1 )

So,

(gamma +1 - gamma +1 ) / (gamma +1 )

= (2)/(gamma +1 )

So, 1 - beta_A^2 = 2/(gamma +1 )

So, gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(2/(gamma +1 )) ) = sqrt( (gamma +1 ) / 2 )

So, gamma_A = sqrt( (gamma +1 ) / 2 )

Now, from equation 2, 1.281 gamma_A = 1 + gamma.

Substituting gamma_A:

1.281 sqrt( (gamma +1)/2 ) = 1 + gamma.

Let me let y = gamma, so the equation becomes:

1.281 * sqrt( (y +1)/2 ) = y + 1.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(1.281)^2 * ( (y +1)/2 ) = (y +1)^2.

Compute 1.281^2 ≈ 1.641.

So,

1.641 * (y+1)/2 = (y+1)^2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

1.641 (y +1) = 2 (y+1)^2.

Divide both sides by (y +1), assuming y +1 ≠ 0 (which it isn't, since gamma >0).

1.641 = 2 (y +1).

So,

y +1 = 1.641 / 2 ≈ 0.8205.

So,

y = 0.8205 -1 = -0.1795.

Wait, that can't be right. Gamma is always greater than 1 for a moving object, so y = gamma would be >1, but this gives a negative value, which is impossible. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the algebra?

Wait, let me go back.

Equation after squaring:

1.641 * (y +1)/2 = (y +1)^2.

Wait, 1.641 * (y +1) = 2 (y+1)^2.

Then, bringing all terms to one side:

2 (y+1)^2 - 1.641 (y+1) = 0.

Factor out (y+1):

(y+1) (2 (y+1) -1.641 ) )= 0.

Since y+1 can't be zero, the other factor must be zero:

2(y+1) -1.641 = 0 → 2(y+1)=1.641 → y +1 = 0.8205 → y= -0.1795.

Hmm, that's impossible because y = gamma is >1. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when substituting. Let me check.

Wait, when I squared both sides, I might have made a mistake. Let me re-examine that step.

We had:

1.281 * sqrt( (y +1)/2 ) = y + 1.

Squaring both sides gives:

(1.281)^2 * ( (y+1)/2 ) = (y +1)^2.

So,

(1.641) * (y +1)/2 = (y +1)^2.

Which is:

1.641 (y+1) = 2 (y+1)^2.

Dividing both sides by (y +1) (assuming y +1 ≠0):

1.641 = 2 (y +1).

So,

y +1 = 1.641 /2 → y+1 = 0.8205 → y= -0.1795.

Which is impossible. So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong, or I made a mistake in the substitution.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back to the two equations.

Equation 2: 1.281 gamma_A = 1 + gamma.

Equation from momentum: (1 + gamma) u = gamma v.

Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of gamma and gamma_A.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that for the A particles, their velocity is the same. So, perhaps all the A particles move with the same velocity, and their momentum adds up.

Wait, another approach: Since the problem gives the rest mass of A, and the initial particles' rest masses, perhaps it's possible to find the velocity using the energy and momentum conservation without knowing the initial velocity of the antiproton.

Wait, but without knowing the initial velocity, how can I find the velocity of A? That's confusing. Maybe the problem is designed such that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Then, the energy after is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A ) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A ) → (938)/(2*300) ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma_A is about 1.563, and then beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(2.443)) → sqrt(1 - 0.409) → sqrt(0.591) → 0.769. So, beta is approximately 0.769.

Which would correspond to option A: 0.77c.

But I'm not sure because earlier steps led to a problem when considering the initial velocity. But in the problem statement, perhaps the initial KE is neglected, which would make the initial energy 2 m_p c², leading to this solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is zero. But that's only possible if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, implying that perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity.

Hmm, perhaps the initial momentum isn't zero, but the problem is designed in such a way that the velocity of the A particles can be found approximately using the initial rest energy.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the annihilation process:

\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-},
\]

where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of particle \(A\) is given as \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \(A\).

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is assumed to be at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. The total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, plus the antiproton's kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, and the total initial energy is approximated as:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2,
     \]
     where \(m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV}\).

   - The initial momentum is entirely due to the antiproton. Since it is moving slowly, its momentum is approximately:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p v,
     \]
     where \(v\) is the velocity of the antiproton.

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - After annihilation, the system produces four particles (\(2A^+\) and \(2A^-\)) of equal mass \(m_A\). The total energy of the final system is:
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2,
     \]
     where \(\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}\) is the Lorentz factor for particle \(A\), and \(v_A\) is its velocity.

   - The total momentum of the final system is:
     \[
     p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A,
     \]
     assuming all particles move in the same direction.

3. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Energy Conservation**:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
     \]

   - **Momentum Conservation**:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.
     \]

4. **Solving for \(\gamma_A\)**:
   - Substituting \(m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) into \(\gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}\):
     \[
     \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
     \]

5. **Relating \(\gamma_A\) to \(v_A\)**:
   - The Lorentz factor \(\gamma_A\) is related to the velocity \(v_A\) by:
     \[
     \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}.
     \]
     Rearranging:
     \[
     v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
     \]

   - Substituting \(\gamma_A \approx 1.563\):
     \[
     v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.563)^2}}.
     \]
     Calculating:
     \[
     (1.563)^2 \approx 2.443, \quad \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 0.409, \quad 1 - 0.409 = 0.591,
     \]
     \[
     v_A \approx c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769c.
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The velocity of particle \(A\) is approximately \(0.77c\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

### Conclusion

The velocity of particle \(A\) is approximately \(0.77c\). 

Answer: A
