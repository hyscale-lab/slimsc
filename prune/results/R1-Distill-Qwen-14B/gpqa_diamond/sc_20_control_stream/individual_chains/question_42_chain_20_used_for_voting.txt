Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. I think that method relies on the gravitational interactions between planets causing changes in their transit times across their star, which can help determine their masses and orbits. But I'm not sure if the method affects the way the problem is solved here, so maybe I can come back to that thought if needed.

The question gives me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, so Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by that factor. Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3, so Planet3 is even hotter than Planet2 by that. Wait, no, wait: the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. So that means T1 is 1.4 times T2, which is higher. Then T2 is 2.3 times T3, so T3 is lower than T2. So the temperatures are T3 < T2 < T1.

Then there's the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2, which is approximately 1.15. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2 by 15%. Similarly, the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is more massive than Planet3 by 35%. So the masses are M1 > M2 > M3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the mass ratios are directly relevant to the orbital periods. Hmm. The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So I need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.

The problem also states that the albedo for all three planets is 0.3, similar to Earth's. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, so I think that's given to simplify the problem, because if albedo is the same, it might cancel out in the calculations.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet can be calculated using the formula:

Te = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / (d^2) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but maybe I can think of it in terms of the inverse square law for radiation. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because the formula usually is something like Te = T_eff * ( R_star / (2d) )^(1/2 ), but I might be mixing up some terms.

Alternatively, from the equilibrium temperature formula, which is:

Te = ( (S * (1 - a)) / (4σ) )^(1/4)

Where S is the solar constant, which is the flux at the planet's distance from the star. So S is proportional to 1/d², where d is the orbital distance.

So, S = L / (4πd²), where L is the star's luminosity. So when we plug that into the equilibrium temperature formula, we get:

Te = ( (L/(4πd²) * (1 - a) ) / (4σ) )^(1/4 )

Simplifying, that's:

Te = ( L (1 - a) )^(1/4 ) / ( (4πσ)^(1/4) * d^(1/2) ) )

So Te is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), which means Te is proportional to 1/√d.

So if the equilibrium temperature ratios are given, I can relate the distances of the planets from their star.

Let me write down the given ratios:

T1 / T2 = 1.4
T2 / T3 = 2.3

So, T1 = 1.4 * T2
T2 = 2.3 * T3 => T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3 = 3.22 T3

Wait, maybe I should express T1 and T3 in terms of T2 and T3.

But perhaps it's better to write the ratios of their distances. Since Te is inversely proportional to 1/sqrt(d), which is same as d is proportional to (1/Te)^2.

Wait, if Te ∝ 1/√d, then √d ∝ 1/Te → d ∝ 1/Te².

So, d1/d2 = (Te2 / Te1)^2

Because d is proportional to 1/(Te)^2.

So, if T1 is larger than T2, then d1 is smaller than d2.

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

d1/d2 = (Te2 / Te1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 ≈ (0.714)^2 ≈ 0.510.

So d2 is about twice as far as d1, since 1/0.51 is about 1.96, so approximately 2 times.

Wait, let me compute that. 1/1.4 is approximately 0.714. Squared is approximately 0.5098, so d1 = 0.5098 * d2 → d2 = d1 * (1/0.5098) ≈ d1 * 1.961, so about 1.96 times d1.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, T2 / T3 = 2.3; so Te2 = 2.3 Te3.

So d2/d3 = (Te3 / Te2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189.

So d3 = d2 / 0.189 ≈ 5.29 d2.

Wait, let me think again. When Te2 is higher than Te3, the planet is closer, right? Because higher Te implies closer orbit.

So, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So if Te increases, d decreases.

So for Planet2 and Planet3, T2 is higher than T3, so d2 < d3.

So, d2/d3 = (Te3/Te2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189. So d3 = d2 / 0.189 ≈ 5.29 d2.

So putting it together:

d3 = 5.29 d2, and d2 is about 1.96 d1.

So d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 d1 ≈ 10.39 d1.

So the orbital distance of Planet3 is about 10.39 times that of Planet1.

But the question is about the orbital period, not the distance. So I need to relate the distance to the orbital period. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star).

So Kepler's law is P² ∝ a³, but more precisely, for a star of mass M, the period P is given by:

P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³

Assuming the mass M of the star is the same for all planets (which it is, same star), then the period is proportional to a^(3/2).

So, P ∝ a^(3/2).

In this problem, the planets are orbiting the same star, so M is the same. Therefore, the period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 is:

(P3/P1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2)

We found that a3 = ~10.39 a1.

So,

P3/P1 = (10.39)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.39^3 )

Wait, wait, 10.39^3 is approximately 10.39 * 10.39 *10.39.

Wait, 10^3 is 1000, but 10.39 is a bit more. Let me compute 10.39^3.

Wait, 10.39 * 10.39 = approx (10 + 0.39)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.39 + 0.39^2 = 100 + 7.8 + 0.1521 ≈ 107.9521.

Then 107.9521 *10.39 ≈ 107.9521 *10 = 1079.521, plus 107.9521 *0.39 ≈ 42.1013 → total ≈ 1121.622.

So 10.39^3 ≈ 1121.622.

So sqrt(1121.622) is approximately 33.5, because 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156, so sqrt(1121.6) is between 33 and 34. Let me compute 33.5^2: 33.5 *33.5 = 1122.25. Oh, that's very close to 1121.6. So the square root is approximately 33.5 - a little less.

Wait, 33.5 squared is 1122.25, which is a bit more than 1121.622, so sqrt(1121.622) ≈ 33.5 - (0.628)/(2*33.5) → approximately 33.5 - (0.628/67) ≈ 33.5 - 0.00937 ≈ 33.4906. So roughly 33.5.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.49.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which matches this.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake. Because the mass of the planets is given, but I thought the Kepler's law considers the mass of the star, not the planets. So if the star's mass is much larger than the planets, the planet masses can be neglected, so the periods would depend only on the star's mass and the planet's distance.

The problem gives the mass ratios between the planets: M1/M2≈1.15, M2/M3≈1.35. So M1 is larger than M2, which is larger than M3. But in Kepler's third law, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So I think the planet masses don't affect the orbital period significantly. So I can ignore them for this calculation.

So the answer should be around 33.4, which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:  
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)  
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)  

   Using the relationship \( T \propto 1 / \sqrt{d} \), the distance ratio can be derived as:  
   \[
   \frac{d_1}{d_2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{1.4}\right)^2 \approx 0.51
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_2 \approx 1.96 \, d_1 \).  

   Similarly, for \( T_2 \) and \( T_3 \):  
   \[
   \frac{d_2}{d_3} = \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2.3}\right)^2 \approx 0.189
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_3 \approx 5.29 \, d_2 \).  

   Combining these, the distance of Planet3 relative to Planet1 is:  
   \[
   d_3 \approx 5.29 \times 1.96 \, d_1 \approx 10.39 \, d_1
   \]

2. **Orbital Period Relationship**:  
   From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto d^3 \), so the ratio of orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2} = (10.39)^{3/2}
   \]  
   First, calculate \( 10.39^3 \):  
   \[
   10.39^3 \approx 1121.6
   \]  
   Then, take the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1121.6} \approx 33.5
   \]  

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

**Final Answer**:  
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is closest to **33.4**, which corresponds to option **D**.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3, so Planet3 is even hotter than Planet2 by that. Wait, no, wait: the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. So that means T1 is 1.4 times T2, which is higher. Then T2 is 2.3 times T3, so T3 is lower than T2. So the temperatures are T3 < T2 < T1.

Then there's the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2, which is approximately 1.15. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2 by 15%. Similarly, the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is more massive than Planet3 by 35%. So the masses are M1 > M2 > M3.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet can be calculated using the formula:

Because the formula usually is something like Te = T_eff * ( R_star / (2d) )^(1/2 ), but I might be mixing up some terms.

Te = ( (S * (1 - a)) / (4σ) )^(1/4)

Where S is the solar constant, which is the flux at the planet's distance from the star. So S is proportional to 1/d², where d is the orbital distance.

So, S = L / (4πd²), where L is the star's luminosity. So when we plug that into the equilibrium temperature formula, we get:

Te = ( (L/(4πd²) * (1 - a) ) / (4σ) )^(1/4 )

Simplifying, that's:

Te = ( L (1 - a) )^(1/4 ) / ( (4πσ)^(1/4) * d^(1/2) ) )

So Te is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), which means Te is proportional to 1/√d.

So if the equilibrium temperature ratios are given, I can relate the distances of the planets from their star.

Let me write down the given ratios:

T1 / T2 = 1.4
T2 / T3 = 2.3

So, T1 = 1.4 * T2
T2 = 2.3 * T3 => T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3 = 3.22 T3

Wait, maybe I should express T1 and T3 in terms of T2 and T3.

But perhaps it's better to write the ratios of their distances. Since Te is inversely proportional to 1/sqrt(d), which is same as d is proportional to (1/Te)^2.

Wait, if Te ∝ 1/√d, then √d ∝ 1/Te → d ∝ 1/Te².

So, d1/d2 = (Te2 / Te1)^2

Because d is proportional to 1/(Te)^2.

So, if T1 is larger than T2, then d1 is smaller than d2.

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

d1/d2 = (Te2 / Te1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 ≈ (0.714)^2 ≈ 0.510.

So d2 is about twice as far as d1, since 1/0.51 is about 1.96, so approximately 2 times.

Wait, let me compute that. 1/1.4 is approximately 0.714. Squared is approximately 0.5098, so d1 = 0.5098 * d2 → d2 = d1 * (1/0.5098) ≈ d1 * 1.961, so about 1.96 times d1.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, T2 / T3 = 2.3; so Te2 = 2.3 Te3.

So d2/d3 = (Te3 / Te2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189.

So d3 = d2 / 0.189 ≈ 5.29 d2.

Wait, let me think again. When Te2 is higher than Te3, the planet is closer, right? Because higher Te implies closer orbit.

So, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So if Te increases, d decreases.

So for Planet2 and Planet3, T2 is higher than T3, so d2 < d3.

So, d2/d3 = (Te3/Te2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189. So d3 = d2 / 0.189 ≈ 5.29 d2.

So putting it together:

d3 = 5.29 d2, and d2 is about 1.96 d1.

So d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 d1 ≈ 10.39 d1.

So the orbital distance of Planet3 is about 10.39 times that of Planet1.

But the question is about the orbital period, not the distance. So I need to relate the distance to the orbital period. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star).

So Kepler's law is P² ∝ a³, but more precisely, for a star of mass M, the period P is given by:

P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³

Assuming the mass M of the star is the same for all planets (which it is, same star), then the period is proportional to a^(3/2).

So, P ∝ a^(3/2).

In this problem, the planets are orbiting the same star, so M is the same. Therefore, the period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 is:

(P3/P1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2)

We found that a3 = ~10.39 a1.

So,

P3/P1 = (10.39)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.39^3 )

Wait, wait, 10.39^3 is approximately 10.39 * 10.39 *10.39.

Wait, 10^3 is 1000, but 10.39 is a bit more. Let me compute 10.39^3.

Wait, 10.39 * 10.39 = approx (10 + 0.39)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.39 + 0.39^2 = 100 + 7.8 + 0.1521 ≈ 107.9521.

Then 107.9521 *10.39 ≈ 107.9521 *10 = 1079.521, plus 107.9521 *0.39 ≈ 42.1013 → total ≈ 1121.622.

So 10.39^3 ≈ 1121.622.

So sqrt(1121.622) is approximately 33.5, because 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156, so sqrt(1121.6) is between 33 and 34. Let me compute 33.5^2: 33.5 *33.5 = 1122.25. Oh, that's very close to 1121.6. So the square root is approximately 33.5 - a little less.

Wait, 33.5 squared is 1122.25, which is a bit more than 1121.622, so sqrt(1121.622) ≈ 33.5 - (0.628)/(2*33.5) → approximately 33.5 - (0.628/67) ≈ 33.5 - 0.00937 ≈ 33.4906. So roughly 33.5.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.49.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which matches this.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake. Because the mass of the planets is given, but I thought the Kepler's law considers the mass of the star, not the planets. So if the star's mass is much larger than the planets, the planet masses can be neglected, so the periods would depend only on the star's mass and the planet's distance.

The problem gives the mass ratios between the planets: M1/M2≈1.15, M2/M3≈1.35. So M1 is larger than M2, which is larger than M3. But in Kepler's third law, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So I think the planet masses don't affect the orbital period significantly. So I can ignore them for this calculation.

So the answer should be around 33.4, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:  
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)  
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)  

   Using the relationship \( T \propto 1 / \sqrt{d} \), the distance ratio can be derived as:  
   \[
   \frac{d_1}{d_2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{1.4}\right)^2 \approx 0.51
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_2 \approx 1.96 \, d_1 \).  

   Similarly, for \( T_2 \) and \( T_3 \):  
   \[
   \frac{d_2}{d_3} = \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2.3}\right)^2 \approx 0.189
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_3 \approx 5.29 \, d_2 \).  

   Combining these, the distance of Planet3 relative to Planet1 is:  
   \[
   d_3 \approx 5.29 \times 1.96 \, d_1 \approx 10.39 \, d_1
   \]

2. **Orbital Period Relationship**:  
   From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto d^3 \), so the ratio of orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2} = (10.39)^{3/2}
   \]  
   First, calculate \( 10.39^3 \):  
   \[
   10.39^3 \approx 1121.6
   \]  
   Then, take the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1121.6} \approx 33.5
   \]  

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

**Final Answer**:  
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is closest to **33.4**, which corresponds to option **D**.
