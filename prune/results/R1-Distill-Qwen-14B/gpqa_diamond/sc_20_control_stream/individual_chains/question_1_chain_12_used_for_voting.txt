Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle from my basic studies. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle with infinite precision. The principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the formula should be ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe it's just ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. I'm not sure about the exact inequality, but I think that's the general idea.

Here, the lifetimes given are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s. Wait, but when we talk about the uncertainty in time, Δt, in the context of a particle's lifetime, I think it refers to the lifetime itself. Or does it consider the uncertainty in measurement time? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe in this problem, Δt is the average lifetime τ, so we can use that to compute the minimum energy uncertainty.

So, for each state, their lifetimes are different. I think the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that we can distinguish them.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? Because the two states have different lifetimes. So, if the energy difference is too small, the lines (in spectroscopy) would overlap and we can't resolve them. So, to distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

So, I need to compute the uncertainty in energy for each state and then find the energy difference that's larger than both.

Let me compute ΔE for each lifetime. Since ΔE = ħ / (2 Δt), but wait, wait. Actually, the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the minimum uncertainty would be when ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

So, for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So Δt is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 would be ħ/(2 * 1e-9).

Similarly, for the second state, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

But wait, I should recall the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Since ħ is h/(2π), that's about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, let's compute each ΔE.

First, for τ1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * τ1)
= (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = approx 5.27e-26 J.

Hmm, I need to convert that into eV because the answer options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, 1 J is 6.242e18 eV.

So, 5.27e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 5.27e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-7 eV = 3.29e-7 eV. So around 3.3e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:

5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27 /1.602) ) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-8 eV = 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.3e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is what's important. The energy difference should be at least the sum of the uncertainties? Or the larger uncertainty?

Hmm, no, because each state has its own uncertainty. But I think the energy difference between the two levels must be larger than the uncertainty in each level for them to be resolvable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the concept. The broader the energy spread (higher uncertainty), the harder it is to resolve closely spaced levels. So, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty of both states.

Wait, no. Each state has its own spread. But when you have two states with different lifetimes, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each. So, the energy difference must be bigger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but here, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, E2 - E1 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty.

Wait, maybe it's more about the maximum uncertainty in each state. So, for the energy difference to be resolvable, the difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each state.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think differently. In spectroscopy, the resolving power is often limited by the uncertainty in energy. So, if the energy levels are too close, their emission or absorption lines would overlap.

The resolving power is given by R = ΔE / Δλ ≈ c / Δλ, where c is the speed of light. But perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the energy uncertainty comes from the natural linewidth, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. So, the natural linewidth for each state is proportional to ħ/τ.

So, for each state, the natural linewidth (ΔE) is about ħ/τ. So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Wait, wait, earlier I used ΔE = ħ/(2 τ), but perhaps the formula uses ΔE = ħ / τ. Because the Heisenberg uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, if Δt is τ, then ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 τ). But sometimes, people use the approximation that ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, ignoring the factor of 2 for simplicity.

So, let's recalculate with ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

Then,

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s = 1.05e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-25 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 /1.602e-19 = approx 6.56e-8 eV.

So, the energy resolution needs to be at least the size of these uncertainties. So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties? Or perhaps larger than the maximum of the two.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about it this way: to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in each level. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

But each state has its own uncertainty. So, for example, if E2 - E1 is larger than ΔE1 and larger than ΔE2, then you can resolve them.

So, the energy difference must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1e-9 eV
B) 1e-11 eV
C) 1e-4 eV
D) 1e-8 eV

So, compute the ΔE1 and ΔE2 using both approaches (with and without the 2 factor).

In the first approach where ΔE = ħ/(2 τ):

ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-7 eV. So, any energy difference less than this would not be resolvable for E1. Similarly, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

In the second approach, where ΔE = ħ/τ, the ΔE1 is 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.56e-8 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1 and ΔE2.

So, looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than either. Options A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than ΔE2 (3.29e-8 or 6.56e-8), so not enough. Option B is 1e-11 eV, which is way too small. Option D is 1e-8 eV.

Wait, let's see.

If with the first approach (with 2):

ΔE1 is ~3.3e-7 eV and ΔE2 is ~3.3e-8 eV.

So, E2-E1 must be greater than 3.3e-7 eV to be resolvable for E1, and greater than 3.3e-8 eV for E2. So, the larger of the two is 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, none of the options are above 1e-4 eV except option C. But 1e-4 is way bigger, so it's definitely resolvable.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state.

So, the minimum energy difference is the maximum of the two uncertainties. So, the energy difference must be larger than 3.3e-7 eV (using the first approach) or 6.56e-7 eV (using the second approach). 

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.3e-7 eV (0.00000033 eV) and 6.56e-7 eV (0.000000656 eV). So, that would definitely be resolvable. But wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger than the larger uncertainty. So, it's easily resolvable.

But what about the other options? Let's check.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Let's see:

In first approach: ΔE1 is 3.3e-7 eV (0.00000033 eV). So, 1e-8 is smaller than that. So, 1e-8 eV is not enough to resolve E2-E1, because the uncertainty in E1 is bigger than that.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no! Wait, E2 - E1 needs to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or each individually? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state. Because, if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty in either state, it's impossible to tell them apart.

Wait, no, the uncertainty in each state is about how precisely you know the energy of that state. So, if the two states are E1 and E2, and their energies have uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable. Because, if E2 is within E1's uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, that's probably the case. So, for two lines to be resolved, the separation (ΔE) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, in this case, ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But let me think. Suppose E1 is measured with uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 is measured with uncertainty ΔE2. For them to be distinguishable, the separation between them must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Because, otherwise, the intervals might overlap.

So, if E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the two states are resolvable.

In our case, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2).

So, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Using the first approach where ΔE = ħ/(2 τ):

ΔE1 = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-9) = 5.25e-26 J → 3.28e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J → 3.28e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.61e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than 3.61e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 / 3.61e-7 ≈ 277 times larger, so definitely above.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's way below 3.6e-7 eV. So, D is too small.

Option A is 1e-9 eV, way too small.

Option B is 1e-11 eV, even smaller.

So, only option C is above the required ΔE.

But wait, let me think again. Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty in the energy difference itself. Because when you have two states, the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties. So, the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainty.

Yes, that's the same as what I thought earlier.

So, the correct energy difference must be larger than 3.6e-7 eV, which is 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So, looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6, but wait, 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6, and 1e-4 is 100e-6. So, 1e-4 is way larger than 3.6e-7.

So, the correct answer is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So, that would work.

But wait, looking at the options, there's another option: D is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So, that's too small.

So, the only option that meets the required ΔE is option C.

Wait a minute. Let me recheck my calculations.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 5.25e-26 J.

Converting to eV: 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.278e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 = 3.278e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.278e-7 + 3.278e-8 = 3.605e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference must be larger than 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.00000036 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → too small.

B)1e-11 → even smaller, no.

C)1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → way bigger.

D)1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → too small.

So, the only option that is larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), given their lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (here, the lifetime \( \tau \)). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

with \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \Delta E \) from joules to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we calculate:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this requirement with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is \( \approx 277 \times 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than the required energy difference. Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle from my basic studies. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle with infinite precision. The principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the formula should be ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe it's just ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. I'm not sure about the exact inequality, but I think that's the general idea.

Here, the lifetimes given are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s. Wait, but when we talk about the uncertainty in time, Δt, in the context of a particle's lifetime, I think it refers to the lifetime itself. Or does it consider the uncertainty in measurement time? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe in this problem, Δt is the average lifetime τ, so we can use that to compute the minimum energy uncertainty.

So, for each state, their lifetimes are different. I think the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that we can distinguish them.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? Because the two states have different lifetimes. So, if the energy difference is too small, the lines (in spectroscopy) would overlap and we can't resolve them. So, to distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

So, I need to compute the uncertainty in energy for each state and then find the energy difference that's larger than both.

Let me compute ΔE for each lifetime. Since ΔE = ħ / (2 Δt), but wait, wait. Actually, the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the minimum uncertainty would be when ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

So, for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So Δt is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 would be ħ/(2 * 1e-9).

Similarly, for the second state, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

But wait, I should recall the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Since ħ is h/(2π), that's about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, let's compute each ΔE.

First, for τ1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * τ1)
= (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = approx 5.27e-26 J.

Hmm, I need to convert that into eV because the answer options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, 1 J is 6.242e18 eV.

So, 5.27e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 5.27e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-7 eV = 3.29e-7 eV. So around 3.3e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:

5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27 /1.602) ) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-8 eV = 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.3e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is what's important. The energy difference should be at least the sum of the uncertainties? Or the larger uncertainty?

Hmm, no, because each state has its own uncertainty. But I think the energy difference between the two levels must be larger than the uncertainty in each level for them to be resolvable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the concept. The broader the energy spread (higher uncertainty), the harder it is to resolve closely spaced levels. So, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty of both states.

Wait, no. Each state has its own spread. But when you have two states with different lifetimes, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each. So, the energy difference must be bigger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but here, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, E2 - E1 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty.

Wait, maybe it's more about the maximum uncertainty in each state. So, for the energy difference to be resolvable, the difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each state.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think differently. In spectroscopy, the resolving power is often limited by the uncertainty in energy. So, if the energy levels are too close, their emission or absorption lines would overlap.

The resolving power is given by R = ΔE / Δλ ≈ c / Δλ, where c is the speed of light. But perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the energy uncertainty comes from the natural linewidth, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. So, the natural linewidth for each state is proportional to ħ/τ.

So, for each state, the natural linewidth (ΔE) is about ħ/τ. So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Wait, wait, earlier I used ΔE = ħ/(2 τ), but perhaps the formula uses ΔE = ħ / τ. Because the Heisenberg uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, if Δt is τ, then ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 τ). But sometimes, people use the approximation that ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, ignoring the factor of 2 for simplicity.

So, let's recalculate with ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

Then,

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s = 1.05e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-25 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 /1.602e-19 = approx 6.56e-8 eV.

So, the energy resolution needs to be at least the size of these uncertainties. So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties? Or perhaps larger than the maximum of the two.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about it this way: to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in each level. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

But each state has its own uncertainty. So, for example, if E2 - E1 is larger than ΔE1 and larger than ΔE2, then you can resolve them.

So, the energy difference must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1e-9 eV
B) 1e-11 eV
C) 1e-4 eV
D) 1e-8 eV

So, compute the ΔE1 and ΔE2 using both approaches (with and without the 2 factor).

In the first approach where ΔE = ħ/(2 τ):

ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-7 eV. So, any energy difference less than this would not be resolvable for E1. Similarly, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

In the second approach, where ΔE = ħ/τ, the ΔE1 is 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.56e-8 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1 and ΔE2.

So, looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than either. Options A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than ΔE2 (3.29e-8 or 6.56e-8), so not enough. Option B is 1e-11 eV, which is way too small. Option D is 1e-8 eV.

Wait, let's see.

If with the first approach (with 2):

ΔE1 is ~3.3e-7 eV and ΔE2 is ~3.3e-8 eV.

So, E2-E1 must be greater than 3.3e-7 eV to be resolvable for E1, and greater than 3.3e-8 eV for E2. So, the larger of the two is 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, none of the options are above 1e-4 eV except option C. But 1e-4 is way bigger, so it's definitely resolvable.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state.

So, the minimum energy difference is the maximum of the two uncertainties. So, the energy difference must be larger than 3.3e-7 eV (using the first approach) or 6.56e-7 eV (using the second approach). 

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.3e-7 eV (0.00000033 eV) and 6.56e-7 eV (0.000000656 eV). So, that would definitely be resolvable. But wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger than the larger uncertainty. So, it's easily resolvable.

But what about the other options? Let's check.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Let's see:

In first approach: ΔE1 is 3.3e-7 eV (0.00000033 eV). So, 1e-8 is smaller than that. So, 1e-8 eV is not enough to resolve E2-E1, because the uncertainty in E1 is bigger than that.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no! Wait, E2 - E1 needs to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or each individually? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state. Because, if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty in either state, it's impossible to tell them apart.

Wait, no, the uncertainty in each state is about how precisely you know the energy of that state. So, if the two states are E1 and E2, and their energies have uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable. Because, if E2 is within E1's uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, that's probably the case. So, for two lines to be resolved, the separation (ΔE) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, in this case, ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But let me think. Suppose E1 is measured with uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 is measured with uncertainty ΔE2. For them to be distinguishable, the separation between them must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Because, otherwise, the intervals might overlap.

So, if E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the two states are resolvable.

In our case, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2).

So, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Using the first approach where ΔE = ħ/(2 τ):

ΔE1 = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-9) = 5.25e-26 J → 3.28e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J → 3.28e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.61e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than 3.61e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 / 3.61e-7 ≈ 277 times larger, so definitely above.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's way below 3.6e-7 eV. So, D is too small.

Option A is 1e-9 eV, way too small.

Option B is 1e-11 eV, even smaller.

So, only option C is above the required ΔE.

But wait, let me think again. Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty in the energy difference itself. Because when you have two states, the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties. So, the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainty.

Yes, that's the same as what I thought earlier.

So, the correct energy difference must be larger than 3.6e-7 eV, which is 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So, looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6, but wait, 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6, and 1e-4 is 100e-6. So, 1e-4 is way larger than 3.6e-7.

So, the correct answer is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So, that would work.

But wait, looking at the options, there's another option: D is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So, that's too small.

So, the only option that meets the required ΔE is option C.

Wait a minute. Let me recheck my calculations.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 5.25e-26 J.

Converting to eV: 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.278e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 = 3.278e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.278e-7 + 3.278e-8 = 3.605e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference must be larger than 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.00000036 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → too small.

B)1e-11 → even smaller, no.

C)1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → way bigger.

D)1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → too small.

So, the only option that is larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), given their lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (here, the lifetime \( \tau \)). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

with \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \Delta E \) from joules to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we calculate:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this requirement with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is \( \approx 277 \times 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than the required energy difference. Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
