Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2. It says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between those energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The question asks which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures of the two stars, T_1 and T_2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). So, I need to recall what I know about the Boltzmann distribution and how excitation levels are related to temperature.

In LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The number of particles in a higher energy state compared to a lower one depends on the temperature. The formula I remember is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. Let's say that the excited state is E_i and the lower state is E_j, so the difference is positive. The number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. So, the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is 2. For star_2, let's see, the ratio would be 1/2 because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, n_i (excited) in star_1 is 2 times n_i in star_2? Or is it about the ratio compared to their respective n_j?

Wait, maybe I should think more carefully. The question states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for a given energy level, the number in that level is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. But wait, if the energy level is higher, then in hotter stars, the excitation is higher. So if the temperature is higher, you have more excitation.

Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same energy levels. So each star's photosphere has iron atoms in the same two energy levels, E_i and E_j, with a difference of 1.38e-23 J. 

So for star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is 2. For star_2, the ratio is... well, it's not given, but I think the problem is that star_1's excitation is twice as much as star_2's. So if star_1's n_i is 2 times star_2's n_i. Or wait, maybe it's that the excitation is twice as much as a function of their respective temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I should define it more precisely. Let me denote for star 1:

n1_i / n1_j = 2

And for star 2:

n2_i / n2_j = x, which I don't know yet. But wait, the problem says the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. That probably refers to the ratio n_i/n_j. So for star_1, it's 2, and star_2's ratio is 1 (since it's half as excited). Wait, no. Wait, "twice as excited" probably means that for a given level, the number is twice. So if star_2's ratio is r, then star_1's ratio is 2r. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, if star_2's ratio is r, then star_1's is 2r. But perhaps another approach is better. Let me model the problem.

Each star's photosphere follows the Boltzmann distribution. So for star 1 and star 2:

n_i / n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Where ΔE is the energy difference, which is the same for both stars because it's the same two energy levels.

So for star_1:
n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2:
n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, perhaps n1_i is 2 times n2_i, but that might not be the case. Or perhaps the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio. But wait, let me think.

Wait, the problem says that the number of excited atoms in a specific level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. But that's not exactly correct. Because the ratio depends on the same level's population relative to another. So for each star, the ratio (n_i/n_j) is given, and star_1's ratio is twice as high as star_2's ratio. So:

n1_i /n1_j = 2 * (n2_i /n2_j )

But wait, the problem says "are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps it's that the number in that level is twice as high, not the ratio. So for example, n1_i = 2 n2_i. But that doesn't make sense, because the number in a level depends on the total number of atoms. So, it's more likely that the ratio is twice.

So, n1_i /n1_j = 2 * (n2_i /n2_j )

But wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose for star_1, the (n_i / n_j) ratio is twice that of star_2. So, the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2. So, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j )

But each ratio for a star's photosphere is given by the Boltzmann factor. So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but that's one way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2. So,

n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j )

Which would be:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Yes, so that gives:

exp( (ΔE/(k )) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Because:

Let me rearrange the exponents:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which is:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Taking natural log on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Let me compute ΔE/(k):

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute k, the Boltzmann constant. k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T_diff, perhaps? Let me see, wait:

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh, wait! That's convenient. So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But wait, let's be precise. Wait, it's (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k)) )

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the sign. Let's go back.

After the exponentials:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Wait, because in the exponent:

(ΔE/(k)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

= (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So:

exp( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Because ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

Take natural log:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Alternatively:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

So, rearranging:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Wait, but that can't be right because ln(2) is positive. So 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1, implying T2 is smaller than T1. So star_1 has higher temperature than star_2.

But let's see the options. The options are in terms of T1 and T2. Let me manipulate the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Let me factor this:

( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

Let me check the options again:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2 )

Yes, that's what I derived.

To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which governs the population of energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Here, \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature of the system.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations in the two energy levels are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors into this equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) = 2
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Since \( \Delta E / k = (1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}) / (1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}) = 1 \, \text{K} \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
