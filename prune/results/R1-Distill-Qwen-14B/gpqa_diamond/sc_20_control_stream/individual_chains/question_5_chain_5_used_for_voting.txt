Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied, so that's the eigenvalue here.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the operator for the direction n would be something like P · n, which is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Or wait, no, because in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be either 0 or 180 degrees. Hmm, maybe n is (nx, 0, nz) where nx² + nz² =1. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of spherical coordinates where direction n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but when in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so cosφ is ±1 and sinφ is zero. So n would be along (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to model n specifically, because the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z. Maybe I can just represent it as n = (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1.

Wait, the operator P is given for each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P along direction n would be P·n = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny = 0. So it's nx P_x + nz P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (nx P_x + nz P_z) corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, actually, the operator P is a vector operator, and the operator along direction n is (P · n) = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. So the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and in this case λ is ħ/2.

So substituting the operator, we have:

(nx P_x + nz P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write P_x and P_z in terms of their matrices.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so in operator terms, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Similarly, P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator (nx P_x + nz P_z) becomes (ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z).

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

(nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So we're looking for eigenvectors of the matrix M = nx σ_x + nz σ_z, where M |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but wait, no, because the right side is |ψ>, but it should have the eigenvalue 1. Because when we write M |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and here λ is 1. Because the equation simplifies to (M) |ψ> = |ψ> where M is nx σ_x + nz σ_z.

So the matrix M is nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]], so M is:

[ nz , nx ]
[ nx , -nz ]

Wait, let me calculate it properly. The Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So M = nx σ_x + nz σ_z = 
nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Which gives:

[ nz * 1 + nx * 0 , nz * 0 + nx *1 ]
[ nz * 0 + nx *1 , nz * (-1) + nx *0 ]

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me compute each element:

Element (1,1): nx*σ_x(1,1) + nz*σ_z(1,1) → nx*0 + nz*(1) = nz
Element (1,2): nx*1 + nz*0 = nx
Element (2,1): nx*1 + nz*0 = nx
Element (2,2): nx*0 + nz*(-1) = -nz

So M is:

[ nz      nx ]
[ nx     -nz ]

So the matrix is:

[nz, nx]
[nx, -nz]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

The eigenvalue equation is (M - I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I = 
[ nz - 1, nx      ]
[ nx     , -nz - 1 ]

So the matrix is:

[ nz-1    nx      ]
[ nx      -nz-1 ]

The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

The determinant is (nz - 1)(-nz -1) - (nx)^2 = 0.

Let me compute that:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) = (-nz^2 -nz + nz + 1) = (-nz^2 + 1)
So determinant = (1 - nz^2) - nx^2 = 0.

But since nx^2 + nz^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), then 1 - nz^2 = nx^2, so substituting:

nx^2 - nx^2 = 0 → 0=0.

Which means that our equation is consistent, but we can proceed to find the eigenvectors.

The equation (M - I)|v> = 0 gives two equations:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0
nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0 → (nz -1) v1 = -nx v2 → v1 = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] v2.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's better to express v2 in terms of v1. Let me try that.

From the first equation: [ (nz -1) ] v1 + nx v2 = 0 → nx v2 = (1 - nz) v1 → v2 = [ (1 - nz)/nx ] v1.

But wait, nx could be zero. Hmm, but in that case, n would be along the z-axis. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me proceed with the assumption that nx is not zero.

So v2 = [ (1 - nz)/nx ] v1.

Let me denote this ratio as a scalar k: k = (1 - nz)/nx.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, k v1) = v1 (1, k).

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, k).

But wait, maybe it's easier to pick v1 = 1, then v2 = k.

So the eigenvector is [1, k]^T, with k = (1 - nz)/nx.

But since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it in terms of an angle θ. Let's say that n is at an angle θ from the z-axis. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So substituting into k:

k = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Using the trigonometric identity, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So k = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [sin(θ/2)] / [cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is (1, tan(θ/2)).

But wait, when θ is 0, which means n is along the +z direction, then sinθ=0, which would make nx=0. Hmm, that might complicate things. But for θ not 0 or π, this approach works.

So the eigenvector is (1, tan(θ/2)).

But wait, let me check for θ=0. Then n is along +z. The operator P·n would be P_z, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is (1,0), because P_z |↑> = (ħ/2)|↑>.

Wait, but according to our earlier parametrization, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so k=(1-1)/0 → undefined. Hmm, so perhaps I should approach this case separately.

But let's proceed for θ not 0 or π.

So the eigenvector is [1, tan(θ/2)].

To normalize this vector, compute its magnitude squared:

|1|^2 + |tan(θ/2)|^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) = 1/(cos²(θ/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] because:

Let me see: [1, tan(θ/2)] = cos(θ/2) [ 1/(cos(θ/2)), sin(θ/2)/(cos(θ/2)) ) ]

Which is cos(θ/2) [1, tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but when normalized, the vector becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that can't be right because [cos(θ/2)]² + [sin(θ/2)]² = 1, which is correct for normalization.

Wait, but wait, because in our case, the eigenvector is [1, tan(θ/2)].

So to normalize, divide by sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) which is sqrt( sec²(θ/2) ) ) = 1/|cos(θ/2)|.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, that's only because I took v1 = 1, and then normalized. So yeah, the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but wait, let's check. When θ=0, the eigenvector should be (1,0), which is what I get because cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. When θ=π/2, the direction is along the x-axis, so the eigenvector should be (0,1), which would correspond to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P_x. Wait no, because when n is along x, the operator is P_x. The eigenvalues of P_x are ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 would be (0,1) in the standard basis. Let's plug θ=π/2 into our expression: cos(π/4) = √2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2. So the vector is (√2/2, √2/2), which doesn't correspond. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me re-express M.

Another approach: The operator along n is a spin-1/2 operator. So the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n. For spin-1/2, the eigenstates can be represented as spherical harmonics with m=+1/2 and m=-1/2.

In the eigenbasis of S·n, the eigenvectors are |+> and |->, which can be written in terms of the computational basis |↑> (eigenstate of S_z) and |↓>.

The general formula for the eigenstate |+> along n is:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But since our direction n lies in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, because n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. Therefore, e^{iφ}=1.

So the state becomes:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

Which in vector form is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, but that's the same as what I got earlier, but when θ=π/2, the vector is (0,1), which is correct for the +eigenvalue of P_x.

Wait, earlier when θ=π/2, the eigenvector is (0,1), which is correct because P_x |0,1> = (ħ/2) |0,1>, since P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

So P_x acting on (0,1) gives (ħ/2)(1,0), which is (ħ/2) times (1,0). Wait, but that's not the same vector. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, no. The operator P_x has eigenvectors |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/√2 and |−x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/√2.

So when θ=π/2, n is along x. Then the eigenvector for +ħ/2 should be |+x> = (1,1)/√2.

But according to the formula I have, when θ=π/2, the vector is (cos(π/4), sin(π/4)) = (√2/2, √2/2), which is (1,1)/√2. Yes, that's correct.

So the general formula works.

So the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but since phi is zero here (n in x-z plane), it would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which is for a different parametrization (like polar coordinates where theta is from z-axis). Option D looks more complicated, but includes hbar, but in the problem statement, the eigenvectors are just vectors, not multiplied by hbar.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but phi is zero, so (cos(theta), sin(theta)).

Wait, but when n is in x-z plane, the polar angle theta would be measured from the z-axis, so theta=0 is along +z, theta=pi/2 along +x, etc. So the spherical harmonics for spin-1/2 would have the components as I wrote earlier.

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

But wait, let's check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the options are about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvectors are normalized, meaning that each component is a dimensionless number. So options A and D have components with hbar, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are states in a Hilbert space). So I can eliminate options A and D because they have factors of hbar.

So the possible options are B and C.

But wait, the problem says the direction n is in the x-z plane, which would imply that phi=0 or phi=pi. So option B's expression becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)) because e^{i*0}=1. Alternatively, if phi=pi, it would be (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

But according to our earlier analysis, the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and the direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Along $\vec{n}$**: The operator along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the given forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes proportional to:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
   \]
   where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we simplify to:
   \[
   \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right) |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle.
   \]

3. **Eigenvector in Spherical Coordinates**: For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) | \uparrow \rangle + \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) | \downarrow \rangle.
   \]
   In vector form, this is:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is already normalized, as:
   \[
   \cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This corresponds to a different parametrization and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: Again, this includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied, so that's the eigenvalue here.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the operator for the direction n would be something like P · n, which is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Or wait, no, because in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be either 0 or 180 degrees. Hmm, maybe n is (nx, 0, nz) where nx² + nz² =1. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of spherical coordinates where direction n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but when in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so cosφ is ±1 and sinφ is zero. So n would be along (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to model n specifically, because the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z. Maybe I can just represent it as n = (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1.

Wait, the operator P is given for each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P along direction n would be P·n = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny = 0. So it's nx P_x + nz P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (nx P_x + nz P_z) corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, actually, the operator P is a vector operator, and the operator along direction n is (P · n) = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. So the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and in this case λ is ħ/2.

So substituting the operator, we have:

(nx P_x + nz P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write P_x and P_z in terms of their matrices.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so in operator terms, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Similarly, P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator (nx P_x + nz P_z) becomes (ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z).

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

(nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So we're looking for eigenvectors of the matrix M = nx σ_x + nz σ_z, where M |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but wait, no, because the right side is |ψ>, but it should have the eigenvalue 1. Because when we write M |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and here λ is 1. Because the equation simplifies to (M) |ψ> = |ψ> where M is nx σ_x + nz σ_z.

So the matrix M is nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]], so M is:

[ nz , nx ]
[ nx , -nz ]

Wait, let me calculate it properly. The Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So M = nx σ_x + nz σ_z = 
nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Which gives:

[ nz * 1 + nx * 0 , nz * 0 + nx *1 ]
[ nz * 0 + nx *1 , nz * (-1) + nx *0 ]

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me compute each element:

Element (1,1): nx*σ_x(1,1) + nz*σ_z(1,1) → nx*0 + nz*(1) = nz
Element (1,2): nx*1 + nz*0 = nx
Element (2,1): nx*1 + nz*0 = nx
Element (2,2): nx*0 + nz*(-1) = -nz

So M is:

[ nz      nx ]
[ nx     -nz ]

So the matrix is:

[nz, nx]
[nx, -nz]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

The eigenvalue equation is (M - I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I = 
[ nz - 1, nx      ]
[ nx     , -nz - 1 ]

So the matrix is:

[ nz-1    nx      ]
[ nx      -nz-1 ]

The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

The determinant is (nz - 1)(-nz -1) - (nx)^2 = 0.

Let me compute that:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) = (-nz^2 -nz + nz + 1) = (-nz^2 + 1)
So determinant = (1 - nz^2) - nx^2 = 0.

But since nx^2 + nz^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), then 1 - nz^2 = nx^2, so substituting:

nx^2 - nx^2 = 0 → 0=0.

Which means that our equation is consistent, but we can proceed to find the eigenvectors.

The equation (M - I)|v> = 0 gives two equations:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0
nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0 → (nz -1) v1 = -nx v2 → v1 = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] v2.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's better to express v2 in terms of v1. Let me try that.

From the first equation: [ (nz -1) ] v1 + nx v2 = 0 → nx v2 = (1 - nz) v1 → v2 = [ (1 - nz)/nx ] v1.

But wait, nx could be zero. Hmm, but in that case, n would be along the z-axis. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me proceed with the assumption that nx is not zero.

So v2 = [ (1 - nz)/nx ] v1.

Let me denote this ratio as a scalar k: k = (1 - nz)/nx.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, k v1) = v1 (1, k).

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, k).

But wait, maybe it's easier to pick v1 = 1, then v2 = k.

So the eigenvector is [1, k]^T, with k = (1 - nz)/nx.

But since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it in terms of an angle θ. Let's say that n is at an angle θ from the z-axis. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So substituting into k:

k = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Using the trigonometric identity, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So k = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [sin(θ/2)] / [cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is (1, tan(θ/2)).

But wait, when θ is 0, which means n is along the +z direction, then sinθ=0, which would make nx=0. Hmm, that might complicate things. But for θ not 0 or π, this approach works.

So the eigenvector is (1, tan(θ/2)).

But wait, let me check for θ=0. Then n is along +z. The operator P·n would be P_z, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is (1,0), because P_z |↑> = (ħ/2)|↑>.

Wait, but according to our earlier parametrization, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so k=(1-1)/0 → undefined. Hmm, so perhaps I should approach this case separately.

But let's proceed for θ not 0 or π.

So the eigenvector is [1, tan(θ/2)].

To normalize this vector, compute its magnitude squared:

|1|^2 + |tan(θ/2)|^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) = 1/(cos²(θ/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] because:

Let me see: [1, tan(θ/2)] = cos(θ/2) [ 1/(cos(θ/2)), sin(θ/2)/(cos(θ/2)) ) ]

Which is cos(θ/2) [1, tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but when normalized, the vector becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that can't be right because [cos(θ/2)]² + [sin(θ/2)]² = 1, which is correct for normalization.

Wait, but wait, because in our case, the eigenvector is [1, tan(θ/2)].

So to normalize, divide by sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) which is sqrt( sec²(θ/2) ) ) = 1/|cos(θ/2)|.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, that's only because I took v1 = 1, and then normalized. So yeah, the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but wait, let's check. When θ=0, the eigenvector should be (1,0), which is what I get because cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. When θ=π/2, the direction is along the x-axis, so the eigenvector should be (0,1), which would correspond to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P_x. Wait no, because when n is along x, the operator is P_x. The eigenvalues of P_x are ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 would be (0,1) in the standard basis. Let's plug θ=π/2 into our expression: cos(π/4) = √2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2. So the vector is (√2/2, √2/2), which doesn't correspond. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me re-express M.

Another approach: The operator along n is a spin-1/2 operator. So the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n. For spin-1/2, the eigenstates can be represented as spherical harmonics with m=+1/2 and m=-1/2.

In the eigenbasis of S·n, the eigenvectors are |+> and |->, which can be written in terms of the computational basis |↑> (eigenstate of S_z) and |↓>.

The general formula for the eigenstate |+> along n is:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But since our direction n lies in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, because n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. Therefore, e^{iφ}=1.

So the state becomes:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

Which in vector form is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, but that's the same as what I got earlier, but when θ=π/2, the vector is (0,1), which is correct for the +eigenvalue of P_x.

Wait, earlier when θ=π/2, the eigenvector is (0,1), which is correct because P_x |0,1> = (ħ/2) |0,1>, since P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

So P_x acting on (0,1) gives (ħ/2)(1,0), which is (ħ/2) times (1,0). Wait, but that's not the same vector. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, no. The operator P_x has eigenvectors |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/√2 and |−x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/√2.

So when θ=π/2, n is along x. Then the eigenvector for +ħ/2 should be |+x> = (1,1)/√2.

But according to the formula I have, when θ=π/2, the vector is (cos(π/4), sin(π/4)) = (√2/2, √2/2), which is (1,1)/√2. Yes, that's correct.

So the general formula works.

So the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but since phi is zero here (n in x-z plane), it would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which is for a different parametrization (like polar coordinates where theta is from z-axis). Option D looks more complicated, but includes hbar, but in the problem statement, the eigenvectors are just vectors, not multiplied by hbar.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but phi is zero, so (cos(theta), sin(theta)).

Wait, but when n is in x-z plane, the polar angle theta would be measured from the z-axis, so theta=0 is along +z, theta=pi/2 along +x, etc. So the spherical harmonics for spin-1/2 would have the components as I wrote earlier.

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

But wait, let's check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the options are about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvectors are normalized, meaning that each component is a dimensionless number. So options A and D have components with hbar, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are states in a Hilbert space). So I can eliminate options A and D because they have factors of hbar.

So the possible options are B and C.

But wait, the problem says the direction n is in the x-z plane, which would imply that phi=0 or phi=pi. So option B's expression becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)) because e^{i*0}=1. Alternatively, if phi=pi, it would be (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

But according to our earlier analysis, the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and the direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Along $\vec{n}$**: The operator along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the given forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes proportional to:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
   \]
   where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we simplify to:
   \[
   \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right) |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle.
   \]

3. **Eigenvector in Spherical Coordinates**: For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) | \uparrow \rangle + \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) | \downarrow \rangle.
   \]
   In vector form, this is:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is already normalized, as:
   \[
   \cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This corresponds to a different parametrization and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: Again, this includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
