Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about the Standard Model extension with some specific Lagrangian terms. The question is about finding the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let's understand the given Lagrangian. The terms include i\bar{N}_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R, which looks like a kinetic term for a right-handed neutrino. Then there's (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2, which is the kinetic term for a scalar field φ. The term |D^μ S|^2 is the gauge kinetic term for a scalar doublet S. There's also a Yukawa term -y_i/2 φ \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c, which probably couples the singlet fermions to the scalar φ. The last term is the potential V(φ, S, H), but I'm not sure what H is here. Wait, H might be another scalar field. Oh, because the question mentions singlet scalars and doublets.

The given VEVs are ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², so ⟨φ⟩ =x and ⟨h⟩=v. Wait, so h is another scalar field, maybe part of the Higgs. So φ is a singlet, and when it gets a VEV, it affects the potential.

The problem is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons typically come from spontaneous symmetry breaking where a symmetry is broken but not completely, leading to massless particles except for possible small corrections. But when you have radiative corrections, these masses can get contributions from other particles in the loop.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism gives mass to the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs field has components that become the Goldstone bosons eaten by the W and Z. But in this case, maybe there's an extended Higgs sector. The scalar fields S and φ are involved, so perhaps the symmetry breaking is more complex.

The Lagrangian includes a scalar doublet S and a singlet φ. The potential V likely has terms that cause φ and other fields to get VEVs. The VEV of φ is given as x^2 + v^2, which suggests it's combining contributions from two fields. Wait, but the VEV is ⟨φ⟩=x and ⟨h⟩=v. Oh wait, maybe φ is a combination of two fields, like a real scalar φ and another scalar h, or perhaps φ itself is a complex field with real and imaginary parts. But the way it's written, ⟨φ⟩^2 is x² + v², so perhaps φ is a complex field with real and imaginary components that each get VEVs. Or maybe φ is a real field, and ⟨h⟩ is another field's VEV? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

The question is about the mass of H2. H2 is a pseudo-Goldstone boson, so I'm thinking it's a remnant of a broken symmetry. The mass would receive contributions from loops involving other particles in the theory.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs mass is determined by the Higgs potential, but when you include radiative corrections (like loops), the mass can get contributions proportional to other particles' masses squared, divided by some scale. The formula for the mass squared is often something like (loop factor) * sum (alpha_i M_i^4), and so on, because in loop expansions, higher dimension operators come with higher powers of the mass.

Looking at the options, all of them have M_h2 squared proportional to 1/(8 π² (x² + v²)) multiplied by a sum of terms. So the structure is M^2 ~ (loop corrections) / (some VEV squared).

In the Standard Model, the Higgs mass can get corrections from top quark loops (since the top has a large Yukawa coupling), W and Z bosons, and any other particles that couple to the Higgs. In this case, the model has singlet fermions N_i, which are right-handed, and they couple to φ via the Yukawa term. So these N_i would contribute to the mass of H2 through loops.

Looking at the options, each term in the curly braces is a coefficient alpha multiplied by a mass squared (to the fourth power?), which seems a bit odd but is standard in loop expansions. For example, the top quark contributes to the Higgs mass with a term like (3 y_t^2 M_t^4)/(16 π² (something)).

In this problem, the options have various terms. Let's see:

Option A includes terms like M_h1^4, M_W^4, M_Z^4, M_{H±}^4, M_{H0}^4, M_{A0}^4, and subtracts a sum of M_{N_i}^4. Hmm, H± and H0 and A0 are probably the charged Higgs and CP-even and CP-odd scalars from the doublet S, perhaps.

Option B has similar terms but subtracts M_t^4, which is the top quark mass. But in the given Lagrangian, I don't see a top quark term. Wait, the model includes N_i, which are singlet fermions, but not the usual SM fermions. Hmm, that's confusing. Unless the problem is in an extension where the top Yukawa is included elsewhere. Or maybe the model includes the usual SM fermions. Wait, the problem gives the Lagrangian as a subset, so perhaps the full model includes the SM fermions, but the given terms are only part of it.

Wait, the term given is -y_i/2 φ \bar{N}^c_{iR} N^c_{iR}. So N_i are right-handed, and the term is for their Yukawa coupling to φ. The SM fermions (like the top) are not directly in this term. So perhaps the model includes the SM fermions as well, but their Yukawa couplings are separate. Or maybe the Yukawa terms for the SM fermions are part of the full Lagrangian, but not shown here.

Wait, the problem says "the Standard Model extension given by the following Lagrangian" which implies that the given terms are the additional terms beyond the SM. So the SM part is standard, and these terms are added. So the SM fermions (like top quarks) are still present, but we have additional singlet fermions N_i.

So in the Lagrangian, the SM fermions are not mentioned, but perhaps they are part of the full model. So the H2 mass would receive contributions from SM particles (like W, Z, top, etc.) and the new particles, the N_i.

Looking at the options, options B and D have M_t^4 terms. Option B adds a term with -α4 M_t^4. Option D only has M_W, M_Z, -M_t, and so on.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian given, I don't see a Yukawa coupling for the top. The top Yukawa would be part of the SM, so assuming that the full model includes that, the top would contribute. So the H2 mass would get a positive or negative contribution from the top's loop.

In the SM, the Higgs mass receives a positive contribution from the top quark due to its large Yukawa coupling. The formula is something like Δm^2 ~ (3 y_t^2)/(16 π²) v^2 M_t^2. Wait, but since in the options, each term is a mass^4 multiplied by an alpha, perhaps it's M^4 instead of M^2. Hmm.

Wait, the mass squared for the Higgs in the SM is given by the Higgs potential, but in loop corrections, the contributions are typically of the form (loop factor) * (sum of (Yukawa couplings)^2 * mass^2), but the loop might contribute to the mass squared as a term proportional to (sum (mass^4 * coupling^2)) / (some scale squared). But not entirely sure.

In any case, looking at the options, the correct formula should include contributions from all the fields that interact with H2. In the model, the H2 is probably a component of the Higgs field that gets a VEV. The corrections would come from loops involving the gauge bosons (W, Z), the top quark (if it's part of the model), and the singlet fermions N_i.

Wait, but the H2 is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. In the SM, the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z. But in this model, perhaps there's a larger symmetry breaking that leaves a pseudo-Goldstone which remains massless at tree level, but gets corrections from loops.

So the mass squared would be something like (loop contributions) / (VEV)^2. The VEV here is sqrt(x^2 + v^2), so the denominator is (x^2 + v^2). Looking at the options, all have denominator 8 π^2 (x^2 + v^2), except option C which has (x^2 + v^2) in the numerator.

Wait, which one is correct? In the SM, the loop corrections to the Higgs mass are proportional to the sum of masses squared (or fourth powers?), divided by the Higgs VEV squared. So the Higgs mass squared is the tree-level term plus loop corrections. So for the loop terms, they would be something like (loop factor) * sum ( (m_i^2) * ... something) divided by (VEV)^2.

Wait, the mass squared would be (loop factor) * (sum (m_i^4 * ... )) / (VEV)^2. Because higher mass terms contribute more. So option A has the denominator as 8 π^2 (x^2 + v^2). Similarly for B, C, D.

In the SM, the Higgs mass receives a correction from the top quark that is proportional to (3 y_t^2 M_t^2)/(16 π^2) (or similar). So when squared, it would be M_t^4 multiplied by some coefficient.

Looking at the options, some have a term -alpha4 M_t^4, others don't. For example, option B has -alpha4 M_t^4, while option D doesn't. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is about the mass of H2. If H2 is a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass at tree level is zero, but radiative corrections (like loops) give it a small mass. The mass would come from loops involving particles that couple to H2.

In models with extended Higgs sectors, the contributions to the pseudo-Goldstone masses can come from all the scalars and gauge bosons, and perhaps fermions that couple to them.

Looking at the given Lagrangian, the potential V(φ, S, H). The scalar S is a doublet, so it can get a VEV, but φ is a singlet. The VEV of φ is given. So perhaps φ is part of the Higgs mechanism that gives mass to some particles, and S is another Higgs field.

Wait, the scalar fields S and φ are involved in the symmetry breaking. The potential could have terms that cause S and φ to get VEVs. The presence of the singlet N_R in the Yukawa term suggests that N_i are heavy fermions that get their masses from φ.

The question is about the radiative correction to H2's mass. So the H2 is a scalar boson, likely a CP-odd or a CP-even state. But in any case, the mass would receive contributions from loops of other particles.

The formula for the mass squared would involve a sum of terms each proportional to the fourth power of other masses, multiplied by some coefficients alpha_i, and then divided by (x^2 + v^2) times 8 pi squared.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A has all the terms except the top quark? Wait, no, option A doesn't have M_t^4.

Option B includes M_t^4 with a negative coefficient.

Option C has (x^2 +v^2) in the numerator, which would make the mass larger, but I thought the denominator is (x^2 +v^2), so probably C is incorrect.

Option D includes M_W, M_Z, H±, H0, A0, and subtracts sum M_Ni^4, but does it include M_t^4? No. It has -alpha4 M_t^4? Wait, D's terms are alpha1 Mh1^4 + alpha2 Mw^4 + alpha3 Mz^4 - alpha4 Mt^4 + ... So that includes the top mass.

Wait, the correct formula should include contributions from the W, Z bosons (since they get masses from the Higgs), from the top quark (because it has a large Yukawa coupling), from the charged Higgs (H±), CP-even (H0), CP-odd (A0) scalars, and the singlet fermions N_i.

Looking at the options, option B includes terms for Mh1 (maybe another Higgs?), M_W, M_Z, subtracts M_t^4, adds H±, H0, A0, and subtracts sum N_i. Option D has similar terms but doesn't include M_t^4. Hmm.

Wait, the Lagrangian includes a term with -y_i/2 φ \bar{N}^c N^c. So the N_i are heavy fermions that get their masses from φ. So their contributions to H2's mass would be negative if they are heavy, as they might contribute via loops.

In the loop corrections, each particle's contribution is proportional to (m_i^2) * (some function of couplings), but in the formula, it's m_i^4 multiplied by an alpha coefficient.

In the SM, the top quark's contribution is positive because of the large Yukawa coupling. So in the options, if the M_t^4 term is subtracted, that would be incorrect. So perhaps the correct option has a positive coefficient for M_t^4.

Wait, but in the options, some have -alpha4 M_t^4.

Wait, the general structure for loop corrections is that each particle contributes a term proportional to (m_i^2 * y_i^2) / (16 pi^2 v^2), but for the mass squared, you get terms that are m_i^4 times the coupling squared, etc.

But the exact signs depend on the type of particle. Gauge bosons (like W, Z) contribute positively. Fermions with Yukawa couplings contribute with a sign depending on their spin. For scalars, it's positive. For fermions, it's negative if they are Dirac fermions, perhaps.

Wait, the general formula for the Higgs mass correction from a fermion loop is:

delta m^2 ~ ( (y_f^2) (m_f^2) ) / (16 pi^2 v^2) ) * something.

But in terms of the mass to the fourth power, perhaps the term is (y_f^2 m_f^4) multiplied by some coefficient.

So for the top quark, which has a large Yukawa coupling, its contribution would be significant and positive. So in the expression for M_h2^2, the term would be positive.

Looking at the options, option B has -alpha4 M_t^4. Option D includes -alpha4 M_t^4.

Wait, but in the loop corrections for the Higgs mass from the top quark, the contribution is positive. So in the mass squared term, it should be added, not subtracted. So any option that has a negative coefficient for M_t^4 would be incorrect.

Looking again, option B has -alpha4 M_t^4, which would be subtracting the top contribution. That can't be right. Option D includes -alpha4 M_t^4 as well.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correction to the Higgs mass from the top is positive because the top Yukawa is large. So in the formula, M_h2^2 would have a positive term from the top. But looking at the options, none of them have a positive M_t^4 term except maybe option A, which doesn't include it.

Wait, let me think about the SM formula. The one-loop correction to the Higgs mass is given by:

Δm^2 = (3 y_t^2 M_t^2)/(16 π² v) * m_h^2 + ... ?

Wait, no, the correction is more accurately:

m_h^2 = μ^2 + (λ v^2)/2 + (loop corrections).

The loop corrections include terms like (3 y_t^4 M_t^4)/(16 π² v^2) + ... .

So the loop correction for the Higgs mass is proportional to (y_t^2 M_t^2)^2 / (v^2). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form.

But in the options, the terms are all in terms of M_i^4. So perhaps the correction is sum (alpha_i M_i^4) divided by (x^2 + v^2).

If the top contributes positively, then the term would have a positive coefficient. But looking at the options, option B and D have negative coefficients for M_t^4.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the sign. Let me think. For a Dirac fermion, the loop correction to the Higgs mass is negative. Because the fermion loop tends to lower the Higgs mass. For scalars, the correction is positive.

So the top quark, being a Dirac fermion, would contribute a negative term. So the coefficient alpha4 would be positive, but the term would be subtracted.

Looking at option B: it has a term -alpha4 M_t^4. So that would be a negative contribution. Which would match the expectation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the general formula for the Higgs mass in multi-Higgs models. In the inert Higgs doublet model, for example, the mass of the CP-odd Higgs can get contributions from various sources.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is computed using the Coleman-Weinberg potential, where the loop corrections are considered. The Coleman-Weinberg potential gives a correction proportional to the sum of (n_i m_i^4)/(64 pi^2) where n_i is the degrees of freedom for particle i.

In that case, scalars contribute + (m_i^4), W bosons contribute + (m_i^4), Z bosons contribute + (m_i^4), but fermions contribute - (m_i^4). Because for each scalar, you have a + (m^4) term, and for each Weyl fermion, it's - (m^4/2), but Dirac fermions are two Weyl, so - (m^4).

So in terms of the formula, each scalar contributes + alpha_i m_i^4, each gauge boson (which is a vector particle) contributes + alpha_i m_i^4, and each Dirac fermion contributes - alpha_i m_i^4.

So for the top quark, being a Dirac fermion, its contribution would be negative. So in the formula, it's subtracted.

Looking at the options, option B includes -alpha4 M_t^4, which would be correct if the top contributes negatively.

Now, looking at all the terms:

- W and Z bosons: these are vector particles, so their contributions are positive. So in the formula, they are added.

- H±, H0, A0: these are scalars, so their contributions are positive.

- N_i: they are Dirac fermions (since they are singlet and have Yukawa terms), so their contributions are negative, hence subtracted.

- The top quark (if present) is a Dirac fermion, so it contributes a negative term.

Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, the top quark isn't present. The model includes N_i, which are singlet fermions, but the standard model fermions (like top) might be part of the full theory. So the H2 mass would get contributions from all the SM particles (like W, Z, top) and the new N_i.

So the correct formula should include positive terms for W, Z, H±, H0, A0, and negative terms for top and N_i.

Looking at the options:

Option B:

alpha1 Mh1^4 + alpha2 Mw^4 + alpha3 Mz^4 - alpha4 Mt^4 + alpha5 MH±^4 + alpha6 MH0^4 + alpha7 MA0^4 - alpha8 sum MNi^4.

So this includes positive terms for Mh1, Mw, Mz, MH±, MH0, MA0, and negative terms for Mt and MNi.

But wait, the model in the problem doesn't have Mh1. Wait, the problem mentions "the approximation of the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2". So H2 is one of the Higgs scalars. The Lagrangian includes S as a doublet, which would give rise to several Higgs bosons: two CP-even (H and h), one CP-odd (A), and the charged ones H±.

But the question is about H2, which is a pseudo-Goldstone. So it's possible that H2 is one of the CP-odd or the charged Higgs?

Alternatively, perhaps the model has multiple Higgs fields, leading to multiple Higgs bosons.

But the problem is about the mass of H2, so the formula for Mh2^2 would include the contributions from all the other particles, including the top.

So option B seems to fit, as it includes all the relevant terms.

Wait, but option D doesn't have the H0 and A0 terms. So it's missing some scalars.

Wait, looking at the problem statement, the Lagrangian includes a scalar doublet S and a singlet φ. The doublet S would have three physical scalars: two CP-even (H and h?), one CP-odd (A), and two charged (H±). So the mass terms for these would come from the potential.

But in the question, the VEV is given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², implying that φ and h (another Higgs field) are involved in symmetry breaking. So the Higgs fields are S and φ.

Wait, but the potential is V(φ, S, H). H must be another field. Or perhaps H is a component of S. Maybe S is the usual Higgs doublet, and φ is another singlet.

So the Higgs fields are S and φ, leading to multiple Higgs bosons. The H2 is a pseudo-Goldstone, so maybe it's a component of S or φ.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure of the model. Perhaps I should focus on the structure of the problem.

The mass formula for H2 would involve contributions from all the heavy particles in the theory. So, the W and Z bosons contribute, the top quark (if present), the charged Higgs (H±), the CP-even (H0, maybe h and H), CP-odd (A0), and the singlet fermions N_i.

Looking at the options, the correct formula should include all these terms.

Option B includes all these terms, including Mh1, Mw, Mz, Mt, MH±, MH0, MA0, and the sum of MNi. So that's a lot of terms, which makes sense.

Option D doesn't include MH0 and MA0, so it's missing some terms.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radiative correction to the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) in an extended Standard Model with the given Lagrangian. The Lagrangian includes singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \), a scalar doublet \( S \), and a singlet scalar \( \phi \), with \( \langle \phi \rangle^2 = x^2 + v^2 \). The mass of \( H_2 \) receives contributions from loop corrections involving particles in the model, such as gauge bosons (\( W, Z \)), fermions (e.g., top quark \( t \)), scalars (\( H^\pm, H^0, A^0 \)), and the singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \).

The mass squared of \( H_2 \) is proportional to loop corrections, which typically take the form:

\[
M_{H_2}^2 \propto \frac{1}{8\pi^2(x^2 + v^2)} \left\{ \sum \alpha_i M_i^4 \right\},
\]

where \( \alpha_i \) are coefficients determined by the interactions and quantum numbers of the contributing particles. Scalars contribute positively, while fermions (Dirac or Majorana) contribute negatively due to their spin statistics. The top quark, being a Dirac fermion, contributes negatively, as do the singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \). Scalars like \( H^\pm, H^0, A^0 \) contribute positively.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes terms like \( M_{h_1}^4, M_W^4, M_Z^4, M_{H^\pm}^4, M_{H^0}^4, M_{A^0}^4 \), but lacks the top quark (\( M_t^4 \)) contribution, which is expected to be significant and negative. This makes Option A incomplete.

- **Option B**: Contains all relevant terms, including \( M_{h_1}^4, M_W^4, M_Z^4, M_t^4, M_{H^\pm}^4, M_{H^0}^4, M_{A^0}^4 \), and subtracts the sum of \( M_{N_i}^4 \). The inclusion of \( M_t^4 \) with a negative coefficient aligns with the expected contribution from the top quark as a Dirac fermion. This option is consistent with the expected structure of the radiative corrections.

- **Option C**: Has \( (x^2 + v^2) \) in the numerator, which is inconsistent with the expected denominator \( (x^2 + v^2) \) in the loop correction formula. This makes Option C incorrect.

- **Option D**: Includes \( M_{h_1}^4, M_W^4, M_Z^4, M_{H^\pm}^4, M_{H^0}^4 \), but omits \( M_{A^0}^4 \) and \( M_t^4 \). The absence of \( M_{A^0}^4 \) and \( M_t^4 \) makes this option incomplete.

Option B is the most consistent with the expected contributions from all relevant particles, including the top quark and singlet fermions, and correctly incorporates the structure of the radiative corrections.

**Answer: B**
