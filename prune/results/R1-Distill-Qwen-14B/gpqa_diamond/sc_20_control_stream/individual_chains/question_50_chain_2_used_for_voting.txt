Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on the expression given. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that the note has the string of constants: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the terms in the perturbative expansion. Each loop typically contributes a factor involving an integral over a momentum, which introduces factors of 1/(4π)^something, and possibly other constants from the theory.

Wait, I think each loop in a Feynman diagram adds a factor of (something like 1/(4π)^something). Oh right, when you calculate loop integrals in four dimensions, you often get factors like 1/(16π²) per loop because of the integration over d^4k in the loop integral. So each loop probably contributes a 1/(16π²) factor. But wait, in different dimensions or regularizations, this might vary, but in standard four-dimensional theory, this is the case.

Let me look at the expression given. The denominator has (4π)^6. So that's (4π)^6 in the denominator. If each loop contributes a (4π)^2 in the denominator (since 1/(4π)^2 per loop?), then how many loops would give us (4π)^6?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each loop typically contributes a factor of (4π)^(-d) where d is the dimension. Since we're in four dimensions, each loop gives 1/(16π²) which is 1/(4π)^2. So each loop adds a 1/(4π)^2 factor. So if I have N loops, the total would be (1/(4π)^(2N)).

Looking at the given expression: it's 1/(4π)^6. So 2N = 6 → N=3. So three loops.

Wait, but let me double-check. The denominator is (4π)^6, so that's 4π raised to the sixth power. Each loop contributes (4π)^(-2), so the number of loops is 6/2=3. So three loops total.

Let me think about the other factors. The expression also has alpha^3 and g^2. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is proportional to the square of the electric charge, e^2/(4π). So alpha is a dimensionless coupling. The number of loops also relates to the order in the coupling constants. For example, a tree-level diagram (no loops) has alpha^0, and each loop might bring in higher powers. But in this case, the overall factors may not directly indicate the number of loops beyond the 4π scaling.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the overall scaling. Each loop in a Feynman diagram adds a certain number of factors. For example, a one-loop diagram would have (something like) (alpha/(4π))^something, but in this case, the denominator is (4π)^6. So yeah, three loops.

Another way: Each loop brings a (4π epsilon)^{-something} when using dimensional regularization, but in four dimensions, perhaps it's just (4π)^2 per loop. So the 1/(4π)^6 would come from three loops.

So the correct number of loops is 3, which is option D.

To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2.
\]

In quantum field theory, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of \(1/(4\pi)^2\) in four-dimensional spacetime due to the integration over loop momenta. This means that the total contribution from \(N\) loops is proportional to \(1/(4\pi)^{2N}\). 

From the given expression, the denominator contains \((4\pi)^6\). Equating this to the contribution from \(N\) loops, we have:

\[
(4\pi)^6 = (4\pi)^{2N}.
\]

Solving for \(N\), we find \(2N = 6\), so \(N = 3\). Therefore, the Feynman diagram contains three loops.

The other factors in the expression, such as \(\alpha^3\) and \(g^2\), relate to the couplings of the theory but do not directly affect the determination of the number of loops. Thus, the number of loops is determined solely by the \((4\pi)^6\) term.

To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2.
\]

In quantum field theory, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of \(1/(4\pi)^2\) in four-dimensional spacetime due to the integration over loop momenta. This means that the total contribution from \(N\) loops is proportional to \(1/(4\pi)^{2N}\). 

From the given expression, the denominator contains \((4\pi)^6\). Equating this to the contribution from \(N\) loops, we have:

\[
(4\pi)^6 = (4\pi)^{2N}.
\]

Solving for \(N\), we find \(2N = 6\), so \(N = 3\). Therefore, the Feynman diagram contains three loops.

The other factors in the expression, such as \(\alpha^3\) and \(g^2\), relate to the couplings of the theory but do not directly affect the determination of the number of loops. Thus, the number of loops is determined solely by the \((4\pi)^6\) term.
