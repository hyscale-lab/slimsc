Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is a simplification where each nucleon is treated as if it's free, ignoring the interactions with the rest of the nucleus. 

The question is asking which of the four assumptions together imply this approximation. The options are A to D, each combining three assumptions. Let me go through each assumption one by one.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So, this means the force is applied to each nucleon separately, not considering how they might influence each other. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, each nucleon is treated independently.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent? I think that means that the other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction. Like, the interaction is only with one nucleon, and the rest don't affect it. So if the nucleus is mostly transparent except for one, then each interaction is like a single collision, hence the impulse. So this assumption supports the approximation.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, okay. Non-relativistic quarks would mean they're moving at speeds much less than light, so you can use non-relativistic mechanics. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, the approximation assumes that each nucleon behaves like a free particle. If the internal structure (like quarks) is non-relativistic, perhaps it's a way to simplify the treatment. But I'm not so sure how this directly leads to the approximation. Maybe it's more about the treatment within the nucleon, not the interaction with others. But wait, if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe the binding forces are weak, supporting the idea that the nucleon is almost free?

Wait, the fourth assumption is: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. So that directly implies that the nucleon is treated as if it's free, not bound. So that supports the approximation.

So, let me think again:

The impulse approximation says that during an interaction (like electroweak), each nucleon is treated as a free particle. So the conditions would be:

Each nucleon interacts individually (assumption 1). The nucleus doesn't affect it beyond that (assumption 2). And the nucleon isn't bound (assumption 4). 

What about assumption 3? It's about quarks being non-relativistic. I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's a red herring or maybe it's necessary for another reason. Oh wait, if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe that implies that the internal structure of the nucleon doesn't contribute significantly to the interaction, so each is treated as a simple, free particle. Or perhaps it's more about the model used to calculate the interaction.

Wait, but the main points are that each nucleon is treated independently, the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect it, and the nucleon isn't bound (so it's free). So the three assumptions would be 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So which is correct?

Wait, let me think. The question says the assumptions jointly imply the approximation. So all three must contribute.

Assumption 1 ensures that each nucleon is considered individually. Assumption 2 says the nucleus is transparent, so the other nucleons don't contribute—so the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction with this one. Assumption 4 says the selected nucleon has no binding forces, meaning it's free.

So the three that matter are 1,2,4. That would be option A.

But wait, what about assumption 3? It says the quarks are non-relativistic. How does that fit in? If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe that allows the use of certain approximations in the model. Or perhaps it's not directly part of the impulse approximation's assumptions but part of another assumption in the calculation. 

Wait, the impulse approximation is more about treating the nucleon as free, not considering their internal structure. So maybe assumption 3 is not part of the necessary conditions for the impulse approximation. Hence, the correct assumptions are 1,2,4, which is option A.

The impulse approximation in nuclear calculations assumes that nucleons behave as free particles during interactions, ignoring their binding forces and interactions with other nucleons. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, let us analyze the given options:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This assumption ensures that each nucleon is treated independently, which aligns with the impulse approximation.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This means that the rest of the nucleus does not contribute to the interaction, effectively isolating the selected nucleon. This supports the impulse approximation by treating the nucleon as if it were free.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: While this assumption simplifies the treatment of the nucleon's internal structure, it does not directly contribute to the impulse approximation, which focuses on the nucleon's interaction with external forces rather than its internal dynamics.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This directly implies that the nucleon is treated as free, which is a key aspect of the impulse approximation.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. Assumption 3, while relevant to the internal structure of the nucleon, is not necessary for the impulse approximation itself.
