Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, a metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, this is a question about a pseudosphere, which is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? Or maybe it's related to a sphere in some kind of spacetime.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, the denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²). So the metric coefficient is 32 divided by that. Hmm, the area element in such a metric would probably involve the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy, right?

Let me think. The metric is written in terms of dx and dy, so it's a 2D metric. The area element A is given by sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal here, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Wait, but in this case, the coefficient is the same for both dx² and dy². So the metric tensor g has components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = g_yx = 0.

So det(g) would be (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² is x² + y². Wait, or is that right? Because det of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So yeah, (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) = (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2.

So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. But wait, wait, no, the area element in 2D is actually (1/2) sqrt(det g) dx dy? No, wait, no, I think it's just sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, when you have the metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx^i dx^j, but in two dimensions, it's sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy. Since g_xy is zero, it's sqrt(g_xx g_yy) dx dy. And since g_xx and g_yy are equal, sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) = 32/(4 - r²).

So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy, where r² = x² + y².

But wait, this is in 2D. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, maybe the radius here refers to a coordinate radius, but in this metric, what defines the radius.

Wait, let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so when (x² + y²) approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That suggests that the maximum radius in this case is when x² + y² <4. So the area might not be finite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the area would be similar to a sphere, but with a different formula. Wait, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But pseudosphere is different.

Wait, no, pseudosphere is a 2D surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. The area of a pseudosphere would be infinite because as you approach the "equator", which is at x² + y² =4, the metric's coefficient becomes large and the circumference becomes infinite. So the area would be infinite.

Alternatively, maybe the metric given is that of a sphere. Wait, let me think again. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in terms of polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so r² = x² + y².

So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32/(4 - r²)] r² dθ². Hmm, that looks like the metric for a sphere, but perhaps with a negative curvature. Wait, no, actually, for a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D is ds² = (a²/(1 - r²/a²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), so 4 is like a²=4, so a=2.

Wait, but that's the metric for a sphere with a =2, but only for r² <4. So the sphere would have a maximum radius of 2, so it's a unit sphere perhaps? Or in 2D, a circle of radius 2. But wait, if that's the case, then the area would be 4π(2)^2 = 16π, but that's not one of the options. Or wait, the question is about a pseudosphere.

Wait, another approach: the area of a surface can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. So if the metric is in 2D, the area is the integral of sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is 32/(4 - r²) dx dy. So in polar coordinates, that becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r from 0 to sqrt(4 - ε), but wait, as r approaches sqrt(4), the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes large. So the integral would be from r=0 to r approaching 2.

Wait, but the area becomes infinite because as r approaches 2, the integrand 32/(4 - r²) * r approaches infinity. So the integral would diverge, meaning the area is infinite. So in that case, the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, another thought: the given metric might represent a pseudosphere. The area of a pseudosphere is actually finite. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Or perhaps the pseudosphere has finite area but infinite extent? No, I think the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature and has finite area but it's developable, but I'm not certain. Wait, the tractricoid, the classic pseudosphere, has finite area. But in this case, perhaps the metric given describes a surface with infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a sphere. But in that case, the area would be 4πr², but the options don't directly have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 0
B) 4π(x² + y²)
C) 4π(x² - y²)
D) +infty

Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". So, the radius here is 2. If the metric is for a sphere of radius 2, then the area would be 4π*(2)^2=16π. But 16π isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, and has infinite area.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric and see what it is.

The Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric components. The formula for K in isothermal coordinates (where g_xx = g_yy = E, and g_xy=0) is:

K = - (1/(2E)) * [ (d/dx (ln E) )_y - (d/dy (ln E) )_x ]

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to note that in 2D, the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) is given by K = - (1/(2 r f(r)^2)) [d/dr (f(r)^2 / r) ]

Alternatively, perhaps using the general formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates. Since the metric is conformally flat, so f(r) = sqrt(g_xx) = sqrt(32/(4 - r^2)). So f(r) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²).

Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates is:

K = - (1/(2)) [ (ln f)''_{xy} - (ln f)''_{yy} ] 

Wait, perhaps that's more complicated than I thought. Alternatively, since the metric is axially symmetric, Gaussian curvature can be determined.

Alternatively, for the metric ds^2 = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), we can compute the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, I think another formula is that for a metric ds² = a(r)^2 dr² + b(r)^2 dθ², the Gaussian curvature is:

K = [ (b''/a) - (b' )²/(2a²) + (b')²/(2b²) ) ] / (b^2)

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe better to compute it correctly.

The Gaussian curvature for a metric in polar coordinates is given by:

K = - (1/(2a²)) [ (d/dr (a² * (b' / b)) ) ]

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula from the metric. Let me try to think in terms of the line element.

Alternatively, the formula for the Gaussian curvature K in terms of the coefficients of the metric is:

K = ( -1/(4 * sqrt(det g)) ) * [ (g_xx g_yy)_xx - 2 (g_xx g_xy)_xy + (g_xx g_yy)_yy ] 

Wait, but since the metric is diagonal, g_xy = 0, so maybe that simplifies the expression.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the metric as given. The metric coefficient is 32/(4 - r²). So the function f(r) = 32/(4 - r²).

The Gaussian curvature K for a surface given in polar coordinates by ds² = f(r) dr² + g(r) r² dθ² is given by:

K = [ (g'(r) / (2 g(r))) ]' / sqrt(f(r) g(r)) - [ (f'(r) / (2 f(r))) ] / r² sqrt(f(r) g(r)).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me look for the formula.

Alternatively, I can compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a conformally flat metric. The given metric is conformally flat because it's of the form ds² = e^{2φ(x,y)} (dx² + dy²). Here, φ(x,y) = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)) = ln( sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) ).

The Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric is given by:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ (Δ φ) ]

Where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space. So let's compute Δ φ.

φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ] = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²)

So the Laplacian of φ in 2D is:

Δ φ = (1/r) d/dr ( r dφ/dr )

Compute dφ/dr:

dφ/dr = (1/2) * ( - (-2r) ) / (4 - r²) ) = ( (r) ) / (4 - r² )

So dφ/dr = r/(4 - r²)

Now, r dφ/dr = r * [ r/(4 - r²) ) ] = r²/(4 - r² )

d/dr [ r dφ/dr ] = d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ]

Let me compute that derivative:

Let’s set u = r², v = 4 - r².

So derivative of u/v is (u’ v - u v’) / v².

u’ = 2r, v’ = -2r.

So (2r (4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ) / (4 - r²)^2 )

= [ 8r - 2 r^3 + 2 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2 )

= [8r ] / (4 - r²)^2 )

So Δ φ = (1/r) * [8r/(4 - r²)^2 ] ) = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

So K = - e^{-2φ} * Δφ.

But e^{-2φ} = e^{ -2*(1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) } = e^{ -ln(32/(4 - r²)) } = (32/(4 - r²))^{-1} = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [ 8/(4 - r²)^2 ) ] 

Simplify:

= - [ (4 - r²) * 8 ) / (32 (4 - r²)^2) ) ]

= - [ 8 / (32 (4 - r²) ) ) ]

= - [ 1/(4 (4 - r²) ) ]

= -1/(16 - 4 r² )

Wait, that's the Gaussian curvature K.

Wait, but wait, for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is a negative constant. So in this case, the curvature depends on r, which suggests that this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, which would have constant curvature.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the metric is for a sphere because the curvature isn't constant. Wait, no, the sphere has positive curvature. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. So perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. But according to my calculation, the curvature K depends on r, which suggests it's not a pseudosphere. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I need to recheck the calculation of the Gaussian curvature. Let me go through it again.

Compute φ:

φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

So dφ/dr = (1/2) * [ (2r) / (4 - r²) ) ] = r/(4 - r²).

Then, r dφ/dr = r^2/(4 - r^2).

Then, derivative of r dφ/dr with respect to r:

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ] 

Let me compute this again.

Let’s write f(r) = r², g(r) = 4 - r².

d/dr [ f/g ] = (f’ g - f g’) / g^2.

f’ = 2r, g’ = -2r.

So numerator is (2r (4 - r²)) - (r²)(-2r) ) = 8r - 2r^3 + 2 r^3 = 8r.

Denominator is (4 - r²)^2.

So d/dr [r²/(4 -r²)] = 8r/(4 -r²)^2.

So Δφ is (1/r) * [8r/(4 -r²)^2 ] = 8/(4 -r^2)^2.

Then, K = -e^{-2φ} * Δφ.

e^{-2φ} = (32/(4 - r²))^{-1} = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r^2)^2 ].

Multiplying, numerator: 8*(4 -r²) = 8(4 - r²).

Denominator: 32*(4 - r²)^2.

So K = - [8(4 - r²)] / [32 (4 - r^2)^2 ] ) 

Simplify: 8/32 = 1/4. (4 - r²) / (4 - r²)^2 = 1/(4 -r²).

So K = - [ 1/(4(4 - r²)) ) ] 

Which simplifies to K = -1/(16 - 4 r²) = -1/(4(4 -r²)).

Hmm, that's not a constant. So the curvature varies with r, which suggests that this is not a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. So perhaps the metric given isn't of a pseudosphere, but perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question says to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the radius being 2 is a hint. Let me think about the metric again.

In the metric, the denominator is (4 -r²), which becomes zero when r=2. So up to r=2, the metric is defined. So the surface extends up to r=2, but beyond that, it's singular. So perhaps this is a sphere of radius 2, but in that case, the area should be 4π(2)^2=16π, but that's not an option. Or perhaps it's a pseudosphere, but in this case, the area is infinite because as r approaches 2, the area element becomes large.

Wait, but the area element is 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ. So when integrating from r=0 to r=2, say from 0 to 2, the integrand becomes 32 r/(4 - r²) dr dθ. The integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, so factor of 2π.

So the area A = ∫θ ∫r [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ

= 2π * ∫r=0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral.

Let me change variables: let u =4 -r² → du= -2r dr → ( -du/2 )= r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 -r²) ) = ∫ [32 (-du/2) ] / u → 32 * (-du/2) / u = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-16)(1/u) du.

But the negative sign flips the limits, so it becomes ∫ from 0 to4 of 16/u du.

Which is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du. But wait, integrating 1/u from 0 to 4 is problematic because ln u from 0 to4 is ln4 - ln0. ln0 is -infty, so the integral diverges. So the area becomes infinite.

So the area is infinite, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Structure**: The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \( f(r) = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \), where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). This implies the area element in polar coordinates is:

   \[
   dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

2. **Radius and Domain**: The denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) becomes singular as \( r \to 2 \). Thus, the metric is defined for \( r < 2 \), and the surface extends up to \( r = 2 \).

3. **Area Calculation**: The total area is obtained by integrating the area element over the entire surface:

   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

   The angular integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:

   \[
   A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

4. **Divergence of the Integral**: To evaluate the radial integral, substitute \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), and the integral becomes:

   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
   \]

   The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln u \to -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). This indicates that the area is infinite.

5. **Pseudosphere Interpretation**: A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. However, the given metric does not describe a pseudosphere because the Gaussian curvature \( K \), derived earlier, depends on \( r \) and is not constant. Instead, the metric describes a surface that becomes singular at \( r = 2 \), leading to an infinite area.

### Conclusion:
The area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite due to the divergence of the area integral as \( r \to 2 \). This matches the behavior of the metric and the options provided.
