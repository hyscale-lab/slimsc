Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let me see what I remember. I think the uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

First, the problem gives me the matrix forms of the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The state of the system is given as a column vector, which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That might be important because when calculating expectation values, it's easier if the state is already in the eigenbasis of the operator we're interested in.

The operator P_z is given as a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So its eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The state is a vector with components a, b, c. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P_z, which are the basis vectors here.

To find the uncertainty of P_z, I need to compute ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). But wait, since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, calculating the expectation value might be straightforward.

Wait, the expectation value of P_z, <P_z>, would be the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state. Because each component in the state vector is the amplitude for that eigenstate.

Wait, let's think again. The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2 ; 1/sqrt(2) ; -1/2 ]. Since the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z, each component corresponds to the amplitude for each eigenstate.

So |c1|^2 is the probability of being in the first eigenstate (eigenvalue ħ), |c2|^2 for the second (0), |c3|^2 for the third (-ħ).

So calculating <P_z> would be |c1|^2 * ħ + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me compute the magnitudes:

c1 is -1/2, so |c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
c2 is 1/sqrt(2), so |c2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.
c3 is -1/2, so |c3|^2 = 1/4.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0. So the expectation value is zero.

Now for <P_z^2>. Well, P_z squared is the square of each eigenvalue, so their squares are ħ², 0, and ħ².

So <P_z^2> = |c1|^2*(ħ²) + |c2|^2*(0²) + |c3|^2*(ħ²) = (1/4)*ħ² + 0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ( ħ² ) / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me confirm the components properly. The state is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). So yes, the square of the magnitudes are correct.

Another thing: the state vector should be normalized. Let's check. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4)=1/2 +1/2 =1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

So the uncertainty would be ħ/sqrt(2). Looking back, the options say option B is that.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$, $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the amplitudes of the eigenstates of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The probabilities of measuring these eigenvalues are given by the squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The expectation value of $P_z$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0^2 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
