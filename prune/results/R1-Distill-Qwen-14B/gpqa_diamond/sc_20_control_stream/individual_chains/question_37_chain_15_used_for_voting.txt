Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many 13C NMR signals the final product E has. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is propionaldehyde. So that's CH3CH2CHO. Then, the first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Wait, EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, right? Or maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be something else. Oh wait, I remember, in the presence of a Lewis acid like BF3, aldehydes can undergo some kind of reaction—maybe a Wittig reaction? Because the Wittig reagent is usually something like an ylide, which is generated from an alkyl halide and a strong base, like BuLi.

Wait, but the first step is Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3. Oh, maybe EDT here is the ylide source. Let me think: typically, to form a ylide, you have an alkyl halide reacting with a strong base like BuLi. Oh wait, but wait, in the first step, the reagent is EDT. I'm trying to recall. Oh, maybe the first step is a crossed aldol addition? Or perhaps the formation of an enolate?

Wait, propionaldehyde is an aldehyde. With BF3 as a catalyst, aldehydes can undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reactions. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the formation of an enol. Or maybe it's the benzoin condensation? Hmm, no, because benzoin needs a different catalyst, like a cyanide.

Alternatively, perhaps BF3 is acting as a Lewis acid to facilitate a cyclization. Let me think: propionaldehyde has three carbons. If it undergoes some kind of cyclization, like forming a five-membered ring? Hmm, but propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. To form a ring, maybe a hemiacetal, but that's more in ketones or aldehydes with adjacent hydroxyl groups. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a ketal? But that usually requires a diol and acid, but propionaldehyde doesn't have a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first step is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is an aldol condensation between two aldehydes, but that would require another aldehyde. But the starting material is only propionaldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a cross-aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: BF3 is a Lewis acid that can help generate enolates. So maybe propionaldehyde reacts to form an enolate. But aldehydes have alpha hydrogens, so perhaps in presence of BF3, the alpha hydrogen is abstracted, forming an enolate. Then, maybe it can undergo some addition. But what's the other reagent, EDT? Hmm, maybe EDT is ethyl diethyl tin. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Baylis-Hillman reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move forward and see if the subsequent steps can help me figure this out.

The second step is A reacting with BuLi to give B. BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially in forming enolates or in the formation of Grignard reagents or organometallics.

Third step: B reacts with bromoethane to give C. Bromoethane is an alkyl bromide, perhaps acting as an electrophile. So maybe B is a strong base that can do an alkylation. For instance, if B is an enolate, then bromoethane would alkylate the enolate, adding an ethyl group.

Fourth step: C is treated with HgCl2, H2O, and H+. HgCl2 in aqueous conditions is a typical condition for the oxymercuration reaction, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion.

Fifth step: D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E. PPh3 is often used in Staudinger reactions or in the formation of ylides for Wittig reactions. Alternatively, if there's a bromide present, maybe an SN2 substitution is happening. BuLi is a strong base again.

Wait, maybe the last step is a reaction that involves the formation of a ylide. So perhaps when you have a bromide (like 3-bromopentane), treated with BuLi, it would deprotonate and form a strong base, like a lithium reagent, which then reacts with another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps D has a double bond, and E is formed via a Wittig reaction. Because PPh3 is used in making ylides. So if D has a double bond, and E is formed by a Wittig reaction, then E would have a new double bond.

Hmm, let me try to reconstruct the entire pathway.

Starting with propionaldehyde, which is CH3CH2CHO.

First reaction: Propionaldehyde + EDT (maybe the ylide) and BF3. Wait, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Wittig reaction.

Wait, the Wittig reaction uses an ylide to convert aldehydes into alkenes. So if we have propionaldehyde and an ylide, it would form an alkene.

Wait, but the first reagent is EDT; perhaps that's the source of the ylide. EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, which I'm not too familiar with, but perhaps in presence of BF3, the ylide is formed. Let me think: To make a Wittig reagent, you typically have an alkyl halide reacting with a strong base like BuLi to form the ylide. For example, R-X + BuLi → RLi, which can then react with PPh3 to form the ylide. Alternatively, if the first step uses EDT, perhaps it's generating the ylide.

Wait, maybe the first step is generating an ylide from propionaldehyde, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Claisen-like condensation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol. Another approach: Maybe Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. BF3 is a Lewis acid that can catalyze such eliminations. So, maybe the aldehyde group is converted into an alkene.

Wait, if propionaldehyde loses a water molecule, it would form CH2=CHCH2 (but that's not possible because it doesn't have the necessary hydroxyl groups adjacent). Oh wait, maybe it's a crossed aldol condensation, but with only the same aldehyde. So, propionaldehyde could undergo an aldol condensation to form a beta-keto aldehyde, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol, which then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is an acid-catalyzed cyclization. Propionaldehyde has three carbons. If it cyclizes, the product would be a three-membered ring, but that's strained. Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it forms a dimer via a condensation reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via elimination. Wait, propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) can't lose H2O directly because it doesn't have a β-hydrogen. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO, and the α carbon is CH2, which has β hydrogens on the adjacent CH2. But wait, BF3 could catalyze the formation of an enol, perhaps.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about the overall process. The final product E is formed through a series of reactions. Let's outline each step:

1. Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3 → A
2. A + BuLi → B
3. B + bromoethane → C
4. C + HgCl2/H2O/H+ → D
5. D + PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → E

Let me think about what each step could be.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3. Perhaps this is a way to generate an enolate, which is A. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reagent formation, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another thought: BF3 is often used in the formation of enol ethers or in some alkylation reactions. For example, in the presence of BF3, an aldehyde can form an enol which can then react with an alkylating agent. But in this case, the alkylating agent might be from the EDT.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl bromide. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a propenol. Let me think: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) could undergo acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an alkene. But wait, the aldehyde group is at the end. Dehydration would require a β hydrogen, which propionaldehyde has. So, the reaction would produce propene (CH2=CHCH3) and water. But wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The structure is:

O=CH-CH2-CH3.

To dehydrate, you lose a water molecule from the aldehyde and a β hydrogen. Wait, but where? Aldehyde is O=CH-, and the adjacent CH2 has hydrogens. So, dehydration would form CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: the structure is O=CH-CH2-CH3. So to form an alkene, perhaps between the aldehyde and the adjacent CH2. But that would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group is converted into an alkene with the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, the structure of propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So, the carbon chain is CH3-CH2-CHO. So, after dehydration, you could form CH2=CH-CH2-O? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the aldehyde group is converted into a vinyl group. Let me think: If the aldehyde (CHO) loses a hydrogen from the alpha carbon (CH2), then you could form a double bond between the aldehyde carbon and the adjacent CH2. So, the product would be CH2=CH-CH2- but that's an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, wait. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. If you dehydrate to form an alkene, the possible product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, that's butene. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CHO.

If you lose a water molecule, you'd have to remove an H from the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde and the O from the aldehyde. But the aldehyde doesn't have an OH, so how does that happen? Maybe it's more like forming an enol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a propargyl bromide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is the formation of a Grignard-like reagent. But BF3 is a Lewis acid, not a base. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider each step's possible outcomes.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde → A via EDT and BF3.

If it's a Wittig reaction, then A would be an alkene. The Wittig reagent would attack the aldehyde, forming an alkene. So, propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacting with an ylide (from EDT and BF3) would form an alkene. So, that would give CH2=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the starting aldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So, the Wittig would replace the O with a CH2 group. Wait, no, the general Wittig replaces the carbonyl O with an R group. So, for example, R2C=O + Ph3P=CHR' → R2C=CHR' + Ph3P=O.

In this case, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. If the ylide is something like CH2=CH- from a bromide, then the product would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The starting aldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The ylide would have a structure like R2P=CH-R''. When it reacts with the aldehyde, it would form CH3CH2CH=CH-R''.

Wait, perhaps the ylide is ethylidene, so the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? But that's butene. But propionaldehyde is three carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but that's four carbons, which would be butene, but starting from propionaldehyde which is three carbons. Hmm, perhaps the product A is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the first step is a different kind of reaction. Let me think about the overall process again.

Looking at the fifth step: D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E. That sounds a lot like the formation of a Wittig reagent. Because BuLi is a strong base that can deprotonate 3-bromopentane, perhaps. Wait, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3. Wait, no, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CH2BrCH2CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. 3-bromo would be CH2CH2CH2Br? No, wait: 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3? No, wait, pentane is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3. 3-bromo would be CH2Br in the middle. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2BrCH2CH3? No, wait, no, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but regardless, when BuLi is added to an alkyl bromide, it can abstract a proton adjacent to the bromide, forming a strong base (like a Grignard or organolithium reagent), which can then react with PPh3 to form a ylide, which is a Wittig reagent.

So, in the fifth step, D is treated with PPh3 and 3-bromopentane in presence of BuLi. So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group, and the ylide from 3-bromopentane would react with D to form an alkene.

Wait, but D comes from C reacting with HgCl2 in H2O and H+. That sounds like oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion. So, C must have a double bond, and D would be an alcohol with an OH group added in the Markovnikov position.

Putting it all together, let's try to map the structures step by step.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3 to form A. If this is a Wittig reaction, then A would be an alkene. Suppose the ylide is CH2=, so the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3 (1-butene). Wait, but propionaldehyde is three carbons, so adding another CH2 would make four. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is CH2Ph, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enolate. So, propionaldehyde treated with BF3 and EDT (maybe a base) forms an enolate. Then, step 2 is adding BuLi, which is a stronger base, so perhaps it deprotonates further.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of each step's possible products.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde → A.

If the first step is a Wittig reaction, then A would be an alkene. The ylide's structure would determine the product. Suppose the ylide is CH2Ph3P=CH2. Then, reacting with the aldehyde would give CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is formed from a different source.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl bromide via a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Claisen rearrangement, but that applies to allyl vinyl ethers.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the final product looks like. The last step involves adding a Wittig reagent, so E probably has a new double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall process is a series of steps that eventually form a more complex molecule with multiple substituents, leading to a certain number of unique carbons in the NMR.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to outline each step as best as I can.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT and BF3 → A.

Assuming this is a Wittig reaction. The aldehyde group (CHO) reacts with an ylide to form an alkene. Let's say the ylide is generated from EDT and BF3. So, the aldehyde would convert into an alkene. Then, A would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. If the ylide's R group is CH2CH3, then the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is from a different source. Let me think: If the ylide is CH2=, then the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? But that's butene, which is four carbons. Starting from three, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a ketone. But propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, and BF3 could act as a catalyst for some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should move on to the next step.

Step 2: A + BuLi → B.

BuLi is a strong base. If A is an enolate, adding BuLi would deprotonate it further, perhaps making a more substituted enolate. Or if A is an alkene, BuLi might add to it, but that usually requires more specific conditions.

Wait, if A is an alkene, treating it with BuLi might lead to a conjugate addition. For instance, a 1,2-addition or 1,4-addition. Or perhaps it's a diene.

Alternatively, if A is an alkyne, BuLi can add to it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a ketone, and BuLi deprotonates it to form an enolate.

But without knowing what A is, it's hard to proceed.

Moving to step 3: B reacts with bromoethane to form C.

Bromoethane is an alkyl bromide. If B is an enolate, then bromoethane would alkylate it, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, if B is an enolate (a conjugate base with negative charge on the alpha carbon), then adding bromoethane would result in alkylation.

So, perhaps C would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position.

Then, step 4: C reacts with HgCl2, H2O, H+ → D.

This is oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion. So, C must have a double bond.

So, after step 3, C has a double bond. Then, oxymercuration adds an -OH group to the more substituted carbon of the double bond, forming an alcohol.

Finally, step 5: D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E.

So, D is an alcohol. The reagents here might be for a Swern oxidation, but more likely, it's forming a new reagent.

Wait, another possibility: D has a carbonyl group. Because in step 5, PPh3 is present, which is often used in the formation of ylides for Wittig reactions.

So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group, and in step 5, a Wittig reagent is formed, which then reacts with D to form an alkene in E.

So, putting it all together:

1. Propionaldehyde → A via Wittig: forms an alkene.
2. A (alkene) reacts with BuLi. Maybe BuLi adds to the alkene, forming a conjugated diene or an organolithium compound.
3. B (organolithium) reacts with bromoethane (alkylating agent) to form C, which has a longer chain.
4. C has a double bond (possibly in a different position) which undergoes oxymercuration to form D, an alcohol.
5. D is treated with reagents to form a Wittig reagent, which reacts with D's carbonyl (if any) to form E with a new double bond.

But I'm not entirely certain about each step. Let's try to map the structures.

Assume step 1: Wittig reaction.

Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with an ylide (from EDT and BF3). Let's say the ylide is CH2=PH3+Li-, then the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but propionaldehyde is three carbons; the product would be four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is derived from something else. Alternatively, maybe the ylide adds a CH2 group, so the product is CH2=CHCH2CH3 (1-butene). But this would mean A is 1-butene.

Then, step 2: A (1-butene) + BuLi → B.

BuLi is a strong base. With an alkene, BuLi can perform a conjugate addition, but 1-butene isn't a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2-addition. BuLi could add to the double bond, but usually, that requires more specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is converted into a diene via a diels-alder-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: If A is an alkene, perhaps step 2 is a hydroboration reaction, but BuLi isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is the formation of a Grignard reagent. If A is an alkene, maybe it's brominated, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that each step adds more complexity, leading to a molecule with multiple substituents, which would result in multiple NMR signals.

The options are 8, 6, 11, or 3. So, the correct answer is likely 8 or 6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product E is a substituted diene with multiple substituents, leading to several unique carbons.

Wait, considering the last step: D → E with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. This sounds like the formation of a Wittig reagent. So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group, and the Wittig reagent (formed from 3-bromopentane and BuLi, in the presence of PPh3) would react with D's carbonyl to form an alkene.

If D is an alcohol, but then how does it have a carbonyl group? Unless D is oxidized. Wait, oxymercuration forms an alcohol. Maybe in a later step, D is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. But in the given steps, D is treated with PPh3, etc., directly.

Alternatively, perhaps D has a carbonyl group already. Let me think. Oxymercuration adds an -OH group to a double bond. So C has a double bond, which after oxymercuration, D is an alcohol. So D is an alcohol with a carbonyl group? No, unless C had a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 (alkylation), C has a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond. Then, oxymercuration adds an -OH across the double bond, but if it's conjugated, maybe the carbonyl is still present.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product E is a tri-substituted alkene, leading to a certain number of unique carbons.

But I'm really not making progress here. Maybe I should think of the number of NMR signals based on symmetry.

Assuming the final product E has multiple substituents leading to unique carbons. For example, if E is a pentadiene with substituents on each carbon, perhaps leading to 8 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps E has several equivalent protons, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, another approach: If each step adds a different substituent, the number of signals increases. Let's say the starting material has 3 carbons, and each step adds more substituents, leading to more unique carbons. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a di-substituted alkene with several substituents on each carbon, leading to 6 signals.

But I'm really not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach, perhaps considering that each step adds a certain number of carbons.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's tough.

Wait, let's think about each step again.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde (3 carbons) → A.

If it's a Wittig, A would have 4 carbons (alkene), so CH2=CHCH2CH3.

Step 2: A reacts with BuLi → B.

BuLi could deprotonate the less substituted end of the alkene, leading to a conjugated diene. Alternatively, if A is CH2=CHCH2CH3, BuLi could add to the double bond, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an alkyne, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, A is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and BuLi adds to it, forming a new compound. But I'm not sure how.

Step 3: B reacts with bromoethane → C.

Bromoethane is an alkylating agent. So, if B is an organolithium compound (like a conjugated base), it would react with bromoethane to form an ethylated product.

So, if B is a lithium species, bromoethane would add an ethyl group, leading to C having an ethyl substituent.

Step 4: C → D via oxymercuration.

So, C must have a double bond. oxymercuration adds an OH group in the Markovnikov position.

Step 5: D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → E.

So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group. Then, the reagents form a Wittig reagent which reacts with the carbonyl to form an alkene.

Putting it together, maybe E has a new double bond, increasing the number of substituents.

But I'm not getting the exact structure, so perhaps I should think about the number of signals.

The options are 8,6,11,3. 11 seems high, perhaps for a more complex molecule. 3 is too low.

Wait, perhaps the final product has several equivalent carbons. For example, if E is a symmetric molecule, like a di-substituted alkene with identical substituents on both ends, leading to fewer signals.

Alternatively, perhaps E has a benzene ring, but that's unlikely given the reagents.

Alternatively, if E is a tri-substituted or tetra-substituted alkene with several substituents, each leading to unique carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Perhaps the correct answer is B) 6 signals.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product, E, resulting from a series of reactions starting with propionaldehyde. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3 → A**  
   Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3. This step is likely a Wittig reaction, where the aldehyde group reacts with an ylide to form an alkene. The product A is assumed to be 1-butene (CH2=CHCH2CH3), which has 4 carbons.

2. **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**  
   BuLi, a strong base, reacts with the alkene A. This step could involve deprotonation or further modification of the alkene, forming an intermediate compound B. However, the exact structure of B remains unclear.

3. **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**  
   Bromoethane, an alkylating agent, reacts with B. This step likely adds an ethyl group to B, forming a more complex compound C with additional substituents.

4. **Step 4: C + HgCl2/H2O/H+ → D**  
   C undergoes oxymercuration, which adds an -OH group across the double bond in a Markovnikov fashion, forming an alcohol D. D now contains a hydroxyl group and possibly a carbonyl group.

5. **Step 5: D + PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → E**  
   This step involves the formation of a Wittig reagent from 3-bromopentane and BuLi, in the presence of PPh3. The Wittig reagent reacts with D (likely containing a carbonyl group) to form a new alkene in E. The final product E is a substituted alkene with multiple substituents.

The number of 13C-NMR signals depends on the number of unique carbons in E. Given the complexity of the reactions and the introduction of multiple substituents, the final product likely has several unique carbons. Among the options provided, the most plausible number of signals is **6**, based on the structural changes and the likely symmetry of the final product.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many 13C NMR signals the final product E has. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is propionaldehyde. So that's CH3CH2CHO. Then, the first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Wait, EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, right? Or maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be something else. Oh wait, I remember, in the presence of a Lewis acid like BF3, aldehydes can undergo some kind of reaction—maybe a Wittig reaction? Because the Wittig reagent is usually something like an ylide, which is generated from an alkyl halide and a strong base, like BuLi.

Wait, but the first step is Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3. Oh, maybe EDT here is the ylide source. Let me think: typically, to form a ylide, you have an alkyl halide reacting with a strong base like BuLi. Oh wait, but wait, in the first step, the reagent is EDT. I'm trying to recall. Oh, maybe the first step is a crossed aldol addition? Or perhaps the formation of an enolate?

Wait, propionaldehyde is an aldehyde. With BF3 as a catalyst, aldehydes can undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reactions. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the formation of an enol. Or maybe it's the benzoin condensation? Hmm, no, because benzoin needs a different catalyst, like a cyanide.

Alternatively, perhaps BF3 is acting as a Lewis acid to facilitate a cyclization. Let me think: propionaldehyde has three carbons. If it undergoes some kind of cyclization, like forming a five-membered ring? Hmm, but propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. To form a ring, maybe a hemiacetal, but that's more in ketones or aldehydes with adjacent hydroxyl groups. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a ketal? But that usually requires a diol and acid, but propionaldehyde doesn't have a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first step is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is an aldol condensation between two aldehydes, but that would require another aldehyde. But the starting material is only propionaldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a cross-aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: BF3 is a Lewis acid that can help generate enolates. So maybe propionaldehyde reacts to form an enolate. But aldehydes have alpha hydrogens, so perhaps in presence of BF3, the alpha hydrogen is abstracted, forming an enolate. Then, maybe it can undergo some addition. But what's the other reagent, EDT? Hmm, maybe EDT is ethyl diethyl tin. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Baylis-Hillman reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move forward and see if the subsequent steps can help me figure this out.

The second step is A reacting with BuLi to give B. BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially in forming enolates or in the formation of Grignard reagents or organometallics.

Third step: B reacts with bromoethane to give C. Bromoethane is an alkyl bromide, perhaps acting as an electrophile. So maybe B is a strong base that can do an alkylation. For instance, if B is an enolate, then bromoethane would alkylate the enolate, adding an ethyl group.

Fourth step: C is treated with HgCl2, H2O, and H+. HgCl2 in aqueous conditions is a typical condition for the oxymercuration reaction, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion.

Fifth step: D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E. PPh3 is often used in Staudinger reactions or in the formation of ylides for Wittig reactions. Alternatively, if there's a bromide present, maybe an SN2 substitution is happening. BuLi is a strong base again.

Wait, maybe the last step is a reaction that involves the formation of a ylide. So perhaps when you have a bromide (like 3-bromopentane), treated with BuLi, it would deprotonate and form a strong base, like a lithium reagent, which then reacts with another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps D has a double bond, and E is formed via a Wittig reaction. Because PPh3 is used in making ylides. So if D has a double bond, and E is formed by a Wittig reaction, then E would have a new double bond.

Hmm, let me try to reconstruct the entire pathway.

Starting with propionaldehyde, which is CH3CH2CHO.

First reaction: Propionaldehyde + EDT (maybe the ylide) and BF3. Wait, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Wittig reaction.

Wait, the Wittig reaction uses an ylide to convert aldehydes into alkenes. So if we have propionaldehyde and an ylide, it would form an alkene.

Wait, but the first reagent is EDT; perhaps that's the source of the ylide. EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, which I'm not too familiar with, but perhaps in presence of BF3, the ylide is formed. Let me think: To make a Wittig reagent, you typically have an alkyl halide reacting with a strong base like BuLi to form the ylide. For example, R-X + BuLi → RLi, which can then react with PPh3 to form the ylide. Alternatively, if the first step uses EDT, perhaps it's generating the ylide.

Wait, maybe the first step is generating an ylide from propionaldehyde, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Claisen-like condensation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol. Another approach: Maybe Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. BF3 is a Lewis acid that can catalyze such eliminations. So, maybe the aldehyde group is converted into an alkene.

Wait, if propionaldehyde loses a water molecule, it would form CH2=CHCH2 (but that's not possible because it doesn't have the necessary hydroxyl groups adjacent). Oh wait, maybe it's a crossed aldol condensation, but with only the same aldehyde. So, propionaldehyde could undergo an aldol condensation to form a beta-keto aldehyde, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol, which then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is an acid-catalyzed cyclization. Propionaldehyde has three carbons. If it cyclizes, the product would be a three-membered ring, but that's strained. Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it forms a dimer via a condensation reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via elimination. Wait, propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) can't lose H2O directly because it doesn't have a β-hydrogen. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO, and the α carbon is CH2, which has β hydrogens on the adjacent CH2. But wait, BF3 could catalyze the formation of an enol, perhaps.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about the overall process. The final product E is formed through a series of reactions. Let's outline each step:

1. Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3 → A
2. A + BuLi → B
3. B + bromoethane → C
4. C + HgCl2/H2O/H+ → D
5. D + PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → E

Let me think about what each step could be.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3. Perhaps this is a way to generate an enolate, which is A. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reagent formation, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another thought: BF3 is often used in the formation of enol ethers or in some alkylation reactions. For example, in the presence of BF3, an aldehyde can form an enol which can then react with an alkylating agent. But in this case, the alkylating agent might be from the EDT.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl bromide. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a propenol. Let me think: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) could undergo acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an alkene. But wait, the aldehyde group is at the end. Dehydration would require a β hydrogen, which propionaldehyde has. So, the reaction would produce propene (CH2=CHCH3) and water. But wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The structure is:

O=CH-CH2-CH3.

To dehydrate, you lose a water molecule from the aldehyde and a β hydrogen. Wait, but where? Aldehyde is O=CH-, and the adjacent CH2 has hydrogens. So, dehydration would form CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: the structure is O=CH-CH2-CH3. So to form an alkene, perhaps between the aldehyde and the adjacent CH2. But that would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group is converted into an alkene with the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, the structure of propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So, the carbon chain is CH3-CH2-CHO. So, after dehydration, you could form CH2=CH-CH2-O? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the aldehyde group is converted into a vinyl group. Let me think: If the aldehyde (CHO) loses a hydrogen from the alpha carbon (CH2), then you could form a double bond between the aldehyde carbon and the adjacent CH2. So, the product would be CH2=CH-CH2- but that's an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, wait. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. If you dehydrate to form an alkene, the possible product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, that's butene. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CHO.

If you lose a water molecule, you'd have to remove an H from the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde and the O from the aldehyde. But the aldehyde doesn't have an OH, so how does that happen? Maybe it's more like forming an enol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a propargyl bromide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is the formation of a Grignard-like reagent. But BF3 is a Lewis acid, not a base. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider each step's possible outcomes.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde → A via EDT and BF3.

If it's a Wittig reaction, then A would be an alkene. The Wittig reagent would attack the aldehyde, forming an alkene. So, propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacting with an ylide (from EDT and BF3) would form an alkene. So, that would give CH2=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the starting aldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So, the Wittig would replace the O with a CH2 group. Wait, no, the general Wittig replaces the carbonyl O with an R group. So, for example, R2C=O + Ph3P=CHR' → R2C=CHR' + Ph3P=O.

In this case, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. If the ylide is something like CH2=CH- from a bromide, then the product would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The starting aldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The ylide would have a structure like R2P=CH-R''. When it reacts with the aldehyde, it would form CH3CH2CH=CH-R''.

Wait, perhaps the ylide is ethylidene, so the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? But that's butene. But propionaldehyde is three carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but that's four carbons, which would be butene, but starting from propionaldehyde which is three carbons. Hmm, perhaps the product A is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the first step is a different kind of reaction. Let me think about the overall process again.

Looking at the fifth step: D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E. That sounds a lot like the formation of a Wittig reagent. Because BuLi is a strong base that can deprotonate 3-bromopentane, perhaps. Wait, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3. Wait, no, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CH2BrCH2CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. 3-bromo would be CH2CH2CH2Br? No, wait: 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3? No, wait, pentane is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3. 3-bromo would be CH2Br in the middle. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2BrCH2CH3? No, wait, no, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but regardless, when BuLi is added to an alkyl bromide, it can abstract a proton adjacent to the bromide, forming a strong base (like a Grignard or organolithium reagent), which can then react with PPh3 to form a ylide, which is a Wittig reagent.

So, in the fifth step, D is treated with PPh3 and 3-bromopentane in presence of BuLi. So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group, and the ylide from 3-bromopentane would react with D to form an alkene.

Wait, but D comes from C reacting with HgCl2 in H2O and H+. That sounds like oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion. So, C must have a double bond, and D would be an alcohol with an OH group added in the Markovnikov position.

Putting it all together, let's try to map the structures step by step.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3 to form A. If this is a Wittig reaction, then A would be an alkene. Suppose the ylide is CH2=, so the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3 (1-butene). Wait, but propionaldehyde is three carbons, so adding another CH2 would make four. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is CH2Ph, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enolate. So, propionaldehyde treated with BF3 and EDT (maybe a base) forms an enolate. Then, step 2 is adding BuLi, which is a stronger base, so perhaps it deprotonates further.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of each step's possible products.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde → A.

If the first step is a Wittig reaction, then A would be an alkene. The ylide's structure would determine the product. Suppose the ylide is CH2Ph3P=CH2. Then, reacting with the aldehyde would give CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is formed from a different source.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl bromide via a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Claisen rearrangement, but that applies to allyl vinyl ethers.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the final product looks like. The last step involves adding a Wittig reagent, so E probably has a new double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall process is a series of steps that eventually form a more complex molecule with multiple substituents, leading to a certain number of unique carbons in the NMR.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to outline each step as best as I can.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT and BF3 → A.

Assuming this is a Wittig reaction. The aldehyde group (CHO) reacts with an ylide to form an alkene. Let's say the ylide is generated from EDT and BF3. So, the aldehyde would convert into an alkene. Then, A would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. If the ylide's R group is CH2CH3, then the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is from a different source. Let me think: If the ylide is CH2=, then the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? But that's butene, which is four carbons. Starting from three, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a ketone. But propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, and BF3 could act as a catalyst for some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should move on to the next step.

Step 2: A + BuLi → B.

BuLi is a strong base. If A is an enolate, adding BuLi would deprotonate it further, perhaps making a more substituted enolate. Or if A is an alkene, BuLi might add to it, but that usually requires more specific conditions.

Wait, if A is an alkene, treating it with BuLi might lead to a conjugate addition. For instance, a 1,2-addition or 1,4-addition. Or perhaps it's a diene.

Alternatively, if A is an alkyne, BuLi can add to it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a ketone, and BuLi deprotonates it to form an enolate.

But without knowing what A is, it's hard to proceed.

Moving to step 3: B reacts with bromoethane to form C.

Bromoethane is an alkyl bromide. If B is an enolate, then bromoethane would alkylate it, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, if B is an enolate (a conjugate base with negative charge on the alpha carbon), then adding bromoethane would result in alkylation.

So, perhaps C would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position.

Then, step 4: C reacts with HgCl2, H2O, H+ → D.

This is oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion. So, C must have a double bond.

So, after step 3, C has a double bond. Then, oxymercuration adds an -OH group to the more substituted carbon of the double bond, forming an alcohol.

Finally, step 5: D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E.

So, D is an alcohol. The reagents here might be for a Swern oxidation, but more likely, it's forming a new reagent.

Wait, another possibility: D has a carbonyl group. Because in step 5, PPh3 is present, which is often used in the formation of ylides for Wittig reactions.

So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group, and in step 5, a Wittig reagent is formed, which then reacts with D to form an alkene in E.

So, putting it all together:

1. Propionaldehyde → A via Wittig: forms an alkene.
2. A (alkene) reacts with BuLi. Maybe BuLi adds to the alkene, forming a conjugated diene or an organolithium compound.
3. B (organolithium) reacts with bromoethane (alkylating agent) to form C, which has a longer chain.
4. C has a double bond (possibly in a different position) which undergoes oxymercuration to form D, an alcohol.
5. D is treated with reagents to form a Wittig reagent, which reacts with D's carbonyl (if any) to form E with a new double bond.

But I'm not entirely certain about each step. Let's try to map the structures.

Assume step 1: Wittig reaction.

Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with an ylide (from EDT and BF3). Let's say the ylide is CH2=PH3+Li-, then the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but propionaldehyde is three carbons; the product would be four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is derived from something else. Alternatively, maybe the ylide adds a CH2 group, so the product is CH2=CHCH2CH3 (1-butene). But this would mean A is 1-butene.

Then, step 2: A (1-butene) + BuLi → B.

BuLi is a strong base. With an alkene, BuLi can perform a conjugate addition, but 1-butene isn't a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2-addition. BuLi could add to the double bond, but usually, that requires more specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is converted into a diene via a diels-alder-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: If A is an alkene, perhaps step 2 is a hydroboration reaction, but BuLi isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is the formation of a Grignard reagent. If A is an alkene, maybe it's brominated, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that each step adds more complexity, leading to a molecule with multiple substituents, which would result in multiple NMR signals.

The options are 8, 6, 11, or 3. So, the correct answer is likely 8 or 6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product E is a substituted diene with multiple substituents, leading to several unique carbons.

Wait, considering the last step: D → E with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. This sounds like the formation of a Wittig reagent. So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group, and the Wittig reagent (formed from 3-bromopentane and BuLi, in the presence of PPh3) would react with D's carbonyl to form an alkene.

If D is an alcohol, but then how does it have a carbonyl group? Unless D is oxidized. Wait, oxymercuration forms an alcohol. Maybe in a later step, D is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. But in the given steps, D is treated with PPh3, etc., directly.

Alternatively, perhaps D has a carbonyl group already. Let me think. Oxymercuration adds an -OH group to a double bond. So C has a double bond, which after oxymercuration, D is an alcohol. So D is an alcohol with a carbonyl group? No, unless C had a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 (alkylation), C has a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond. Then, oxymercuration adds an -OH across the double bond, but if it's conjugated, maybe the carbonyl is still present.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product E is a tri-substituted alkene, leading to a certain number of unique carbons.

But I'm really not making progress here. Maybe I should think of the number of NMR signals based on symmetry.

Assuming the final product E has multiple substituents leading to unique carbons. For example, if E is a pentadiene with substituents on each carbon, perhaps leading to 8 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps E has several equivalent protons, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, another approach: If each step adds a different substituent, the number of signals increases. Let's say the starting material has 3 carbons, and each step adds more substituents, leading to more unique carbons. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a di-substituted alkene with several substituents on each carbon, leading to 6 signals.

But I'm really not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach, perhaps considering that each step adds a certain number of carbons.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's tough.

Wait, let's think about each step again.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde (3 carbons) → A.

If it's a Wittig, A would have 4 carbons (alkene), so CH2=CHCH2CH3.

Step 2: A reacts with BuLi → B.

BuLi could deprotonate the less substituted end of the alkene, leading to a conjugated diene. Alternatively, if A is CH2=CHCH2CH3, BuLi could add to the double bond, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an alkyne, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, A is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and BuLi adds to it, forming a new compound. But I'm not sure how.

Step 3: B reacts with bromoethane → C.

Bromoethane is an alkylating agent. So, if B is an organolithium compound (like a conjugated base), it would react with bromoethane to form an ethylated product.

So, if B is a lithium species, bromoethane would add an ethyl group, leading to C having an ethyl substituent.

Step 4: C → D via oxymercuration.

So, C must have a double bond. oxymercuration adds an OH group in the Markovnikov position.

Step 5: D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → E.

So, perhaps D has a carbonyl group. Then, the reagents form a Wittig reagent which reacts with the carbonyl to form an alkene.

Putting it together, maybe E has a new double bond, increasing the number of substituents.

But I'm not getting the exact structure, so perhaps I should think about the number of signals.

The options are 8,6,11,3. 11 seems high, perhaps for a more complex molecule. 3 is too low.

Wait, perhaps the final product has several equivalent carbons. For example, if E is a symmetric molecule, like a di-substituted alkene with identical substituents on both ends, leading to fewer signals.

Alternatively, perhaps E has a benzene ring, but that's unlikely given the reagents.

Alternatively, if E is a tri-substituted or tetra-substituted alkene with several substituents, each leading to unique carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Perhaps the correct answer is B) 6 signals.


The problem involves determining the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product, E, resulting from a series of reactions starting with propionaldehyde. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3 → A**  
   Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3. This step is likely a Wittig reaction, where the aldehyde group reacts with an ylide to form an alkene. The product A is assumed to be 1-butene (CH2=CHCH2CH3), which has 4 carbons.

2. **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**  
   BuLi, a strong base, reacts with the alkene A. This step could involve deprotonation or further modification of the alkene, forming an intermediate compound B. However, the exact structure of B remains unclear.

3. **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**  
   Bromoethane, an alkylating agent, reacts with B. This step likely adds an ethyl group to B, forming a more complex compound C with additional substituents.

4. **Step 4: C + HgCl2/H2O/H+ → D**  
   C undergoes oxymercuration, which adds an -OH group across the double bond in a Markovnikov fashion, forming an alcohol D. D now contains a hydroxyl group and possibly a carbonyl group.

5. **Step 5: D + PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → E**  
   This step involves the formation of a Wittig reagent from 3-bromopentane and BuLi, in the presence of PPh3. The Wittig reagent reacts with D (likely containing a carbonyl group) to form a new alkene in E. The final product E is a substituted alkene with multiple substituents.

The number of 13C-NMR signals depends on the number of unique carbons in E. Given the complexity of the reactions and the introduction of multiple substituents, the final product likely has several unique carbons. Among the options provided, the most plausible number of signals is **6**, based on the structural changes and the likely symmetry of the final product.

**Answer: B**
