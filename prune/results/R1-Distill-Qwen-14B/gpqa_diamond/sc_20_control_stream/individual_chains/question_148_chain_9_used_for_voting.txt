Alright, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds, and we're given details about five different substances A1 to A5. The goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

First, I'll list out what each A does based on the description.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Decomposition producing F2 suggests that A1 might be a fluoride where fluorine is in a higher oxidation state. When it decomposes, maybe fluorine is released as F2.

A2 is a product of A1's decomposition. The oF (I think this refers to oxidation state of F) is 31.96%. Wait, 31.96% as in the percentage composition? Or perhaps the oxidation state? Hmm. Wait, maybe it's the oxidation state of F in A2. Let me think. Fluorine's common oxidation states are -1, +1, +3, +5, +7. Wait, 31.96% sounds like a decimal that's close to 0.32, which would be +3 maybe? Because 3 divided by 10 is 0.3. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage of F by mass. Let's see, if A2 is a binary compound, maybe YF3? Because 3 F atoms. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 would be YF. Wait, but element Y could be in different oxidation states. Alternatively, maybe A3 is another fluoride, like YF2 or YF3, depending on how much fluorine is added.

Then, A4 is another compound. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. Hmm. So A5 is probably a salt, maybe a fluorinated Y compound. When it's in water, perhaps it breaks down into YF (or something) and another compound. Wait, like maybe hydroxide or something else.

Wait, let's think about the known fluorides. Fluorine often forms binary compounds with metals. For example, with sodium, you get NaF, NaF2 (but I'm not sure if that exists), NaF3? Or maybe with nonmetals. But considering the context, perhaps Y is a metal.

Looking at the decomposition of A1: when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So A1 would be a fluoride where fluorine has a higher oxidation state. For example, if A1 is YF4, decomposition might produce YF2 and F2? Wait, that's a possibility. Because YF4 decomposing could break into YF2 and F2 gas.

Wait, let's think about a possible decomposition reaction:

2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + F2↑

But wait, that would require YF4 to be a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF3? No, because if it decomposes into F2 and another compound. Maybe YF5? But fluorine typically doesn't go beyond +7 in oxidation states, and YF5 would have Y in +5. But when it decomposes, maybe it produces YF3 and F2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a non-metal. Wait, but the problem says it's a binary compound, so Y is another element combining with F.

Wait, let me think about the oxidation states. Let's say A1 is YF3. If it decomposes into F2 and another fluoride, perhaps YF. So the reaction would be:

YF3 → YF + F2↑

But that seems unlikely because YF3 is more stable. Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2.

Wait, but how does that affect the oxidation state of F in A2?

In A1, Y's oxidation state would be determined by F's. Let's say in A1, F is in a higher oxidation state than in A2.

Alternatively, let's think about what the bright red substance could be. One such compound is lead(IV) fluoride, PbF4, but I don't think that's bright red. Wait, another possibility is silver(I) fluoride, AgF, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(II) fluoride, HgF2. Wait, no. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a metal fluoride but something else. Wait, another thought—could it be a diatomic fluoride? Oh wait, no, because F2 is already a diatomic molecule.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because O is a non-metal and the compounds would be O-F bonds, but the question mentions element Y, which may be a metal.

Wait, perhaps A1 is something like YF5? But I'm not sure if that's a real compound. Alternatively, maybe Y is a transition metal. For example, Y could be lead (Pb), which forms various fluorides like PbF2, PbF4.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. If A1 is PbF4, then upon decomposition, perhaps it forms PbF2 and F2. The reaction would be:

2 PbF4 → 2 PbF2 + F2↑

In this case, PbF4 has F in -2 oxidation state (since Pb is +4), and PbF2 has F in -1. So when PbF4 decomposes, F2 (oxidation state 0) is released. But how does that fit with the oF in A2 being 31.96%?

Wait, the oF is 31.96%. Maybe that's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Let's calculate. If A2 is PbF2, then the molar mass would be Pb (207.2) + 2*19 (38) = 245.2 g/mol. Fluorine is 38/245.2 ≈ 15.5%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if A2 is YF3. Let's calculate. YF3: Y is say, lead? No, because PbF3 isn't common. Alternatively, Y could be something else.

Wait, maybe Y is sodium. Let me see. If A1 is NaF3? Wait, sodium typically forms NaF, NaF2 (not sure if it exists), but NaF3 is unlikely because sodium usually has a +1 oxidation state. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with higher oxidation states. Let's say Y is tin. SnF4 decomposes? Wait, SnF4 is tin(IV) fluoride. If it decomposes, maybe it produces SnF2 and F2. Let's check the molar mass.

SnF4: Sn is 118.71, F is 19 each. So 118.71 + 4*19 = 118.71 +76 = 194.71 g/mol.

Fluorine percentage: (4*19)/(194.71) = 76/194.71 ≈ 39%. Which is higher than 31.96%. Hmm.

Wait, what if A2 is YF3? Let's think of Y as something that would have YF3 as a compound. For example, Y could be Al. AlF3 has F in -1 each. So AlF3 would have 3 F atoms. The molar mass of AlF3 is 27 + 3*19 = 27+57=84 g/mol. Fluorine percentage: (57/84)*100 ≈ 67.86%. Still higher than 31.96%.

Wait, maybe the oF is the oxidation state, not the mass percentage. Oh! Wait, maybe I completely misunderstood that part. If oF is the oxidation state of fluorine in A2, then it's 31.96% sounds like it's 3+ (since 3 is 30% of 10). Wait, 31.96% is close to 0.32, which would be 32% but that's not a common oxidation state. Hmm, maybe it's 3. So perhaps the oxidation state is +3?

Wait, perhaps A2 is YF3, and F has an oxidation state of +3 in A2. But wait, fluorine is typically more electronegative, so it's usually in a -ve oxidation state. Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking this wrong.

Wait, another approach: maybe the oxidation state is 31.96% of something. Alternatively, perhaps the oF is the percentage composition by mass of fluorine in A2.

Wait, if A2 is YF, then the F percentage would be 19/(Y + 19) *100. Let's say Y is 23 (Na), then F is 19/(23+19)=19/42≈45.2%, which is higher than 31.96%.

If Y is 39 (K), then F is 19/(39+19)=19/58≈32.76%. Oh! That's close to 31.96%. Hmm, maybe Y is potassium.

Wait, that would make A2 KF. So when KF is formed, F is in -1 oxidation state. So when A1 decomposes, it produces KF and F2. So what would A1 be? Maybe KF3 or KF4?

Wait, KF3: K has +3 charge? Is that possible? Potassium usually is +1, but under certain conditions can have higher oxidation states. Let's see, KF3 would be K(+3) F(-1) each. So F is -1, as in KF.

Wait, but if A1 is KF3, and it decomposes into KF and F2, then the reaction would be:

2 KF3 → 2 KF + F2↑

So in KF3, each F is in -1 oxidation state. Wait, no—KF3: Each F is -1, because K is +3. So each F is -1, same as in KF. Wait, that doesn't change the oxidation state. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is KF2. So K is +2. Then, upon decomposition, it produces KF and F2.

So:

2 KF2 → 2 KF + F2↑

In KF2, F is -1 each. In KF, F is also -1. So the oxidation state of F doesn't change. That doesn't make sense; the decomposition should involve a change in oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A1 is KF4. So K is +4. Then, decomposition would produce KF2 and F2.

So reaction:

KF4 → KF2 + F2↑

In KF4, F is -1 each. In KF2, F is -1 each. Wait, same again. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is a different compound. Let me think about another element. Let's say Y is calcium. If A2 is CaF2, then the F percentage would be (2*19)/(40 + 38) = 38/78 ≈48.7%. That's higher than 31.96%.

Wait, what if Y is strontium (Sr)? SrF2 would have F mass 38/(Sr(87.62) + 38) =38/125.62 ≈30.26%. Close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's getting close. So if Y is Sr, then A2 is SrF2, which has F mass (38/125.62)*100≈30.26%. Hmm, perhaps a bit low.

Alternatively, Y could be something with a higher molar mass. Let me think, maybe Y is barium? BaF2: Ba is about 137.33. So BaF2's molecular weight is 137.33 + 38=175.33. F mass is 38/175.33≈21.7%, which is lower than 31.96%.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the other parts to see if that helps.

A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it may undergo reactions under certain conditions. Fluorine can react with noble gases under specific circumstances, like high temperatures or pressures. So if A3 is a fluoride, perhaps it can react with Xe to form a compound.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is a higher fluoride than A2. If Y is in a higher oxidation state, maybe A3 is YF3 if A2 is YF2. Or perhaps it's a different structure.

Moving on to A4. When Y is added in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes into two substances in water. So perhaps A5 is a salt that breaks down into YF and another compound.

Wait, what if A4 is a fluoride with a different structure. For example, if A4 is YF6^3- (like YF6^3- as a complex ion?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF3, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the formation of A5. When Y is added to a solution of A4, perhaps a double displacement reaction occurs. So if A4 is, say, Y2F6 (but that's speculative). Or maybe A4 is a salt with a different anion, like YF4.

Wait, another angle: the problem mentions that when Y is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 then decomposes in water. Maybe A5 is a hydroxide or something else.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a hydrofluoric acid derivative. Like, maybe it's a fluoride of another element. For example, if A4 is SiF4, adding Y (say, Na) could produce NaF and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of hydrogen fluoride, but that's not a binary compound with Y yet.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let me think of a real example. Lead(IV) fluoride (PbF4) decomposes upon heating to form lead(II) fluoride (PbF2) and F2 gas:

2 PbF4 → 2 PbF2 + F2↑

In this case, A2 would be PbF2. Let's calculate the fluorine percentage in PbF2. Pb is about 207.2 g/mol, F is 19. So PbF2's molar mass is 207.2 + 38 = 245.2 g/mol. Fluorine mass is 38/245.2 ≈15.5%. Hmm, which doesn't match 31.96%.

Wait, but earlier when I considered Y as K, in KF2, the fluorine percentage was (2*19)/(39 + 38) = 38/77 ≈49.35%. That's higher than 31.96%.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about other possibilities. Wait, maybe the oF refers to the oxidation state, not the mass percentage.

So if oF is 31.96%, perhaps it's the oxidation state of fluorine in A2. Wait, 31.96% as a decimal is approximately 0.3196. That's roughly 0.32, which could correspond to an oxidation state of +3? Because 3 is about 30% of 10, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if A2 has fluorine in +3 oxidation state, then the compound would be YF3. For example, if Y is Al, AlF3. But fluorine in +3? That's unusual. Fluorine usually has negative oxidation states.

Alternatively, perhaps the oxidation state is negative. Like -3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall structure.

A1 is a binary compound of Y and F. So it's YF_x. Decomposes into YF_y and F2. So the reaction would involve splitting into F2 and a different fluoride.

So, YF_x → YF_y + F2.

The oxidation states of Y must stay the same? Or change? Hmm.

In the decomposition, F's oxidation state: in A1, F is in a higher oxidation state than in A2, because F2 is 0. So perhaps in A1, F is in +1, and in A2, F is in -1.

Wait, for example, if A1 is YF3. Then, upon decomposition, it could produce YF and F2.

YF3 → YF + F2.

In YF3, F is -1 each (since Y is +3). In YF, F is -1. So F's oxidation state didn't change. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because decomposition should produce F2 (oxidation state 0), so perhaps F is being reduced or oxidized.

Wait, maybe in A1, F is in a higher oxidation state. For example, if A1 is YF4, F is -1 each. Then, upon decomposition, it produces YF2 (F-1 each) and F2 (F0). So F in YF4 is -1, same as YF2. So no change.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible fluorides and their decomposition.

Another possibility: A1 is YF5. Decomposes into YF3 and F2.

YF5 → YF3 + F2.

In YF5, F is -1 each (Y is +5). In YF3, F is -1 each. So again, F's oxidation state doesn't change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in A1, F is in a higher oxidation state, like +1. For example, if Y is in a +3 oxidation state, and F in +1, then in A2, Y is in a lower state. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the oxidation state of F in A2 is 31.96% of the total. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the percentage of F by mass.

Wait, let's think of A2 as YF. Then, F is 19/(Y+19) *100 =31.96%.

So:

19/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y+19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 60 → Y ≈ 60-19=41.

41 is approximately the atomic weight of titanium (Ti is about 47.87, close to 41). Wait, but 41 is not matching any element exactly. Let's see, Y=41, but the closest is Ga (69.72), which is higher. Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, 19/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y+19 =19/0.3196 ≈60 → Y=41. So which element has an atomic weight of about 41? Scandium (Sc) is about 45, which is a bit higher. Titanium is 47.87, which is higher than 41. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that A2 is YF3, and the fluorine percentage is 31.96%.

So 3*19 / (Y + 3*19) = 0.3196 → 57/(Y +57) = 0.3196 → Y+57 =57/0.3196≈178 → Y≈178-57=121.

121 g/mol is close to Sn (tin is about 118.71 g/mol). So Y would be Sn. So A2 is SnF3?

Wait, but does SnF3 exist? Or is it SnF2 or SnF4? I'm not sure.

Wait, if Y is Sn (118.71), then A2 would be SnF3. Let's check:

3 F atoms: 3 *19 =57g/mol. Sn is 118.71. Total=175.71 g/mol. F percentage: (57/175.71)*100≈32.45%. Which is close to 31.96%. So perhaps A2 is SnF3.

If Y is Sn, then A1 could be SnF4. Because SnF4 would decompose into SnF2 and F2. Let's see:

SnF4 → SnF2 + F2↑

In this case, Sn in SnF4 is +4. In SnF2, it's +2. So F in SnF4 is -1, same as in SnF2. So the F oxidation state doesn't change, which is confusing because decomposition should involve a change in oxidation states. Alternatively, perhaps F in A1 is in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, maybe in A1, F is in a higher oxidation state than in A2. So perhaps in A1, F is +1, and in A2, F is -1. Then, when A1 decomposes, F is both reduced and oxidized ( disproportionation).

For example, A1 could be YF2. Decomposes into YF and F2.

YF2 → YF + 0.5 F2↑

In YF2, F is -1 each. In YF, F is -1. Hmm, same again.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state in A1. For example, Y is in +5 in A1.

Wait, perhaps Y is lead. Let me see:

A1: PbF4 → PbF2 + F2↑

In PbF4, F is -1 each. Pb is +4.

In PbF2, F is -1 each. Pb is +2.

So the decomposition is:

2 PbF4 → 2 PbF2 + F2↑

In this case, Pb is being reduced (from +4 to +2), and F is being oxidized (from -1 in PbF4 to 0 in F2). So the F is oxidized, which makes sense because F2 is a stronger oxidizing agent.

So A2 would be PbF2. Now, what's the fluorine percentage in PbF2?

Pb: 207.2 g/mol. F2:38 g/mol. Total: 245.2 g/mol. F percentage: (38/245.2)*100≈15.5%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the other parts of the problem.

A3 can interact with xenon. So perhaps A3 is a fluoride that's reactive enough to react with Xe. Fluorine itself is very reactive, but in a compound, maybe it's less so. So A3 could be a higher fluoride, like YF3, which can react with Xe under certain conditions, perhaps in the presence of a catalyst or high temperature.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is YF3, perhaps.

Moving on to A4: when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot concentrated colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes into two substances in water. Let's think about what A4 could be. Maybe A4 is a fluoride with a different structure, like YF6^3- or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound, like HOF (hydrogen monofluoride?), but that's not common. Alternatively, A4 could be YF5, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a solution of HFO (like NaFO?), but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF3. When Y is added, maybe a double displacement occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A5 in water. So A5 could be a salt that breaks into YF and another component. For example, if A5 is YF·H2O, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4. Adding Y (in 1:1 ratio) might produce YF3 and another compound. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. Adding Y would produce YF2 and something else.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of YF5. Adding Y could produce YF4 and HF, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: since A4 is a concentrated solution and colorless, perhaps it's a solution of a salt that doesn't color the solution. For example, NaF solution is colorless.

Wait, but if A4 is NaF, and adding Na in a 1:1 ratio... Hmm, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a different compound, like YF6^3-, which when Y is added, precipitates something.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different element's fluoride. For example, if Y is sodium, A4 could be SiF4. Adding Na would produce NaF and something else.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the possible molecular weights.

The options for A4's molecular weight are:

A) 140-160

B)220-240

C)160-180

D)110-130.

If A4 is a fluoride, say YF3, and Y is around 120 (like Sn), then YF3's molecular weight would be 120 + 57=177, which falls into option C (160-180).

Alternatively, if Y is Pb (207.2), then YF3 would be 207.2 +57=264.2, which is outside the options. So that can't be.

Wait, but earlier I thought Y was around 41 based on A2 being YF. But that didn't match any element. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider Y as Ti (47.87). So YF would be 47.87 +19=66.87 g/mol. F percentage would be 19/66.87≈28.4%, which is lower than 31.96%.

Hmm. Not matching.

Maybe I should think of a different approach. Let's assume that Y is lead. Then, A1 could be PbF4. Upon decomposition, it produces PbF2 and F2.

So A2 is PbF2. The F percentage is 38/245.2≈15.5%, which doesn't match 31.96%. So that can't be.

Another approach: let's think of A2 as YF, where Y has an atomic weight that makes the F percentage 31.96%.

So:

(Y + 19) * 0.3196 =19 → Y +19 =19 / 0.3196 ≈60 → Y≈41.

Which element is around 41 g/mol? Scandium is 45, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the actual value is around 39.9 (which is K). Let me check:

If Y is K (39.9), then YF is 39.9 +19=58.9 g/mol. F percentage: (19/58.9)*100≈32.3%. That's very close to 31.96%. So perhaps Y is potassium.

So A2 is KF. Then, what is A1? Since A1 decomposes into KF and F2. So A1 would be a higher fluoride, perhaps KF3 or KF4.

But potassium typically doesn't form KF3. Let me think about KF3. K would be +3, F -1 each. So KF3 would be K(+3) F3(-3), which is possible. But I'm not sure if it's a known compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is K2F5? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A1 is KF4. So KF4 would decompose into 2 KF and F2:

KF4 → KF + 0.5 F2.

In KF4, K is +4, F is -1. In KF, K is +1, F is -1. So during decomposition, K is reduced from +4 to +1, and F is oxidized from -1 to 0. So that makes sense as a decomposition reaction.

So the reaction would be:

2 KF4 → 2 KF + F2↑.

In this case, A2 is KF. The fluorine percentage in KF is (19)/(39.9 +19) *100 ≈32.3%, which matches the given 31.96% closely, allowing for rounding.

So Y is potassium (K), and A2 is KF.

Now, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So fluorinating K would produce KF, but that's A2. Alternatively, perhaps A3 is a higher fluoride, like KF3 or KF5. But KF3 is not common. Alternatively, perhaps KF2 is formed under certain conditions. Wait, but KF2 isn't a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps A3 is KF itself, but that's the same as A2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe A3 is a different compound, like a complex fluoride.

But for now, let's proceed. So Y is K.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps A3 is KF3, which is a possible compound under certain conditions (like high pressure or temperature). Then, A3 could react with Xe under certain conditions.

Now, A4: when K is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

So, perhaps A4 is a solution of KF2. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, A4 could be a solution of KFO (like KHF2?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: when K is added to a solution of a fluorosilicate or similar, perhaps a precipitate forms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of KF5, but I'm not familiar with that compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound, like K2F6 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of KF, but that doesn't make sense because adding K would not react.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of a different element's fluoride. For example, if A4 is SiF4, adding K might produce KF and something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of CaF2. Adding K might not react. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HFO (like HFO acid), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a complex fluoride. For example, K2F6 is potassium hexafluorosilicate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe when K is added to a solution of a different fluoride, like AlF3, it would precipitate AlF3·nH2O or something. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: when Y (K) is added to A4's solution, A5 forms. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a salt that breaks down into KF and another ion.

Wait, let's think of A5 as KF·H2O, but that's not likely. Alternatively, A5 could be a double salt that dissociates.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a hydroxide. For example, if A5 is KOH and something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF). But adding K would produce KH (not a real compound) and F. No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm not making progress on A4. Let's think about the molecular weight.

If Y is K (39.9), and A4 is a fluoride with formula YF_x, then the molecular weight would be 39.9 + 19x.

Looking at the options, which are ranges. Let's see:

Option D: 110-130. So 110 ≤ MW ≤130.

If x=3, then 39.9 +57=96.9 → below 110.

x=4: 39.9 +76=115.9 → which is in option D (110-130).

So if A4 is KF4, its molecular weight is around 115.9, falling into option D.

But wait, earlier I thought A1 might be KF4. So A4 could be KF4.

In that case, when K is added to a hot, concentrated solution of KF4, perhaps a reaction occurs. For example:

KF4 + K → ?

But I'm not sure what the product would be. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: A4 is KF5. Molecular weight would be 39.9 + 5×19=39.9+95=134.9, which falls into option C (160-180? No, 134.9 is between 110-130? No, 134.9 is higher than 130, so option D is 110-130, so 134.9 would be outside.

Hmm. Another thought: if A4 is K2F5. Molecular weight would be 2×39.9 +5×19=79.8 +95=174.8, which falls into option C (160-180). So if A4 is K2F5, then the molecular weight is about 175, which is in option C.

But I'm not sure if K2F5 is a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is K3F6. Let's calculate: 3×39.9=119.7, 6×19=114. Total=233.7 g/mol, which is beyond the options.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is KF3 (molecular weight 39.9+57=96.9 → option D is 110-130, so 96.9 is below that. Doesn't fit.)

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound, like HFO (which is HF, but that's a binary compound of F and H, not Y). Alternatively, A4 is a solution of a salt that when K is added, forms a precipitate.

But without knowing the exact compounds, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the information I have.

If Y is potassium, and A4 is KF4, which has a molecular weight of ~116, then the range would be 110-130, which is option D.

Alternatively, if A4 is K2F5 (175 g/mol), which is in option C.

But earlier, A1 was thought to be KF4, which decomposes into KF and F2. So A4 might not be KF4, as that's A1.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a different compound, like KFO. But I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of KF2, which has a molecular weight of 39.9+38=77.9, which is below 110. Doesn't fit.

I think I've spent enough time. Considering all the possibilities, I'll go with option C) 160-180, but I'm not entirely sure.

The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4 based on the given information about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Here's the analysis:

1. **A1 Decomposition**: A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). This suggests A1 is a fluoride with fluorine in a higher oxidation state. A plausible candidate for A1 is YF₄, which decomposes into YF₂ and F₂.

2. **A2 Fluorine Percentage**: A2 has a fluorine percentage of 31.96%. If A2 is YF₂, the molecular weight of Y can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Fluorine percentage} = \frac{\text{Mass of F}}{\text{Molar mass of A2}} \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values, the atomic weight of Y is approximately 41 g/mol, which is close to potassium (K, 39.9 g/mol). Thus, Y is likely potassium.

3. **A3 Fluorination**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. If Y is potassium, A3 could be KF₃ or another higher fluoride. However, the exact identity of A3 is not critical for determining the molecular weight of A4.

4. **A4 and A5 Formation**: A4 is a colorless, concentrated solution. When potassium is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes into two substances in water. This suggests A4 is likely a fluoride of potassium, such as KF₄ or K₂F₅.

5. **Molecular Weight of A4**: 
   - If A4 is KF₄, its molecular weight is:
     \[
     \text{Molar mass of KF₄} = 39.9 + 4 \times 19 = 115.9 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
     This falls within the range of 110-130 (Option D).
   - If A4 is K₂F₅, its molecular weight is:
     \[
     \text{Molar mass of K₂F₅} = 2 \times 39.9 + 5 \times 19 = 174.8 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
     This falls within the range of 160-180 (Option C).

Given the ambiguity in the exact identity of A4, both options are plausible. However, based on the decomposition reaction of A1 (likely KF₄), A4 is more likely to be KF₄, with a molecular weight of 115.9 g/mol, placing it in the range of 110-130.
