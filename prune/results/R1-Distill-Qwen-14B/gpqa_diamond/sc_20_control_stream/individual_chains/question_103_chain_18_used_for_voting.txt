Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. The main ring is a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. Wait, the ketone is on the ethanone part. Oh wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure is a benzene ring attached to a ketone (CO) group, with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, no. Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the benzene ring. The ring has a bromo group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5 relative to the point where the ketone is attached. So the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So the numbering would be: the ketone is on carbon 1, then the ring positions are 3 and 5. So the substituents are meta to each other but on the benzene ring.

So the benzene has three substituents: a ketone (as a substituent), a bromine, and a nitro group. Wait, no, the ketone is part of the side chain. Let me think again. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. The ethanone is CH3CO-. So the structure is Ph-CO-CH3, where Ph is the 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group.

So the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point where the COCH3 group is attached. So the COCH3 is at position 1 (assuming the numbering starts there), then bromo is at position 3, nitro at position 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So we have a benzene ring with substituents in the 1,3,5 positions? Wait, no. Wait, the COCH3 is at position 1, and the substituents are at 3 and 5. So that's two substituents on the ring, not three. So the ring has three substituents: the COCH3 group, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So it's a meta-substituted pattern relative to the ketone.

So, starting from benzene, I need to introduce these substituents in the correct positions. The question is about the sequence of reactions that would yield this compound in high yield.

So the synthesis steps involve several reactions: bromination, nitration, acetylation, and maybe some substitutions or reductions.

I know that directing groups are important here. Nitro groups are strong meta directors, while bromine (as a substituent) is also a meta director. Acetyl groups (from ketones) are also meta directors in electrophilic substitution reactions.

But wait, the ketone (COCH3) is an electron-withdrawing group. So it would direct incoming substituents to the meta position.

Wait, but the COCH3 group is attached to the benzene. So when we add the Br and the nitro group, their positions depend on the directing effect of the existing substituents.

Let me think about the order in which these substituents are added because the order will affect the positions where the next substituents attach.

Option A: The steps are CH3COCl/AlCl3; then Br2/FeBr3; then HNO3/H2SO4; then Fe/HCl; then HNO3 again; etc. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check each option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible steps needed.

First, benzene can be acetylated to form acetophenone (phenyl ketone). Then, we need to introduce substituents at the meta positions relative to the ketone. But wait, if the ketone is already present, any subsequent nitration or bromination would occur at the meta positions relative to it.

Wait, but the target has two substituents: Br and nitro. So perhaps the steps involve adding these substituents in the correct order, considering their directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced last. Because when adding nitro groups, which are strong meta directors, the positions might influence where other groups go.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituents and their order.

The target has a nitro group and a bromine in the meta positions relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is the last group added? Or maybe it's the first.

Wait, the ketone is part of the ethanone, so it's attached via the benzene ring. So perhaps the order is to first add the nitro group, then bromine, then the acetyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced first, then the other substituents.

Wait, let me think about each possible option.

Looking at option D: The steps are HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?); NaNO2/HCl (another nitration? Or diazotization?); H3PO2 (probably a reducing agent, like for hydrolysis). Then Br2/FeBr3, then CH3COCl/AlCl3, then HNO3 again. Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe not the right order.

Alternatively, let's think about how to get the substituents in the correct positions.

If we start by nitration, the nitro group would be added in a certain position. Then bromination, but the directing effect would depend on the existing groups.

Wait, but the target has two substituents: Br and nitro. Let me think about their positions. The ketone is the main substituent, so perhaps the nitro and Br are introduced before the ketone?

Wait, no. Because the ketone is part of the ethanone side chain. So the benzene ring has the COCH3 group attached, which directs incoming substituents to meta positions.

But wait, if I first introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, and then the ketone, maybe the positions would be correct.

Wait, let me model this.

Suppose we start with benzene.

Step 1: Nitration. Benzene → nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director.

Step 2: Bromination with FeBr3. Nitro groups direct meta. So in nitrobenzene, adding Br would go to the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, nitrobenzene has the nitro group in position 1. Adding Br would go to position 3 or 5? Wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 3 and 5 are equivalent in the case of mono-substituted. So Br would add at position 3.

So now the benzene has nitro in position 1 and Br in position 3. Wait, no. Wait, nitro is in position 1; bromination would add in meta, which is position 3 or 5. But benzene is symmetric, so it doesn't matter which one because they're the same.

Wait, but then we need to add the ketone group. Where would that go?

Wait, but the ketone is a substituent attached to the benzene. So perhaps next, we add the ketone group in a position that's influenced by the existing substituents.

But wait, the existing substituents are nitro and Br, which are both meta directors. So adding another group would be directed by these.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. However, nitro groups deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult or impossible. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to the benzene ring, but benzene with deactivating groups (like nitro) won't undergo Friedel-Crafts easily because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, so that complicates things. So perhaps the order must be such that the acylation (adding the ketone) happens before any deactivating groups are introduced.

Wait, that makes sense because Friedel-Crafts can't happen if the ring is deactivated.

So perhaps the ketone (COCH3) must be introduced first.

So first, benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone (the ketone attached to benzene). Then, the next substituents can be added, but since the ketone is a meta director, the nitro and bromine would be added in the meta positions relative to it.

Wait, but then we have two substituents: nitro and Br. So after the ketone, the next step would be to nitrate. Nitration would occur meta to the ketone.

So acetophenone's structure is Ph-COCH3. When nitrated, the nitro group would add meta to the ketone, so at position 3 relative to the ketone.

Then, the next substituent would be bromine. Now, after nitration, the benzene has two substituents: ketone and nitro, both meta directors. So adding Br would be influenced by these.

Wait, but wait: the nitro group is a strong meta director. The ketone is also a meta director. So when adding the bromine, where would it go?

The ketone is at position 1; nitro is at position 3. So the ring positions available would be positions 5, 4, 2, etc., depending on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the positions. Let's say the ketone is at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone). Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 3. The next step would be bromination; where would Br add?

The existing substituents are the ketone (1) and nitro (3). Both are meta directors. So for bromination, the incoming Br would be directed to the remaining available positions. Let's see: in a benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 3, the next substituent would be added based on the directors.

Wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director, so it would direct incoming groups to its meta position, which is position 5 (since it's at 3). Alternatively, the ketone at position 1 is a meta director, so would direct to position 5 as well, since position 3 is already taken.

Wait, maybe in this scenario, the Br would add at position 5, which is meta to both. So the ring would have substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), and 5 (Br). But wait, our target only has two substituents: Br and nitro, with the ketone. So maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration and bromination steps are done in a different order.

Wait, perhaps after the ketone is added, bromination is done next. So:

Step 1: Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1).

Step 2: Bromination. Since the ketone is a meta director, the Br would add at position 3.

Now, the ring has COCH3 (1) and Br (3).

Next, nitration: the nitro group would be added meta to the ketone, which is at position 3, but that position is already taken by Br. So where else can it go? Alternatively, the nitration would be directed by the Br.

Wait, but Br is a meta director as well. So the nitro group would be added at position 5, relative to the Br (position 3). So nitration would add at position 5, which is meta to Br and also meta to the ketone.

Wait, wait, the ketone is at 1, Br at 3. The nitro group could add at position 5, which is meta to both.

So the ring would have substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). But our target molecule only has two substituents on the ring: Br and nitro. So perhaps this approach leads to three substituents, which isn't the case.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back to the target molecule.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is connected to the ethanone, so the ring has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So the ring has three substituents: the ethanone group (position 1), Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait a second, that's three substituents on the benzene ring! So perhaps the earlier assumption that the ring only has two substituents was wrong. So the ring has the ethanone group (position 1), Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5. So it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, that's a possibility. So I need to add substituents at positions 1,3,5.

Wait, but the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, which would add the substituent at position 1. Then, the next substituents (Br and nitro) are added at 3 and 5.

So the question is, how to get these substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think again. Steps would be:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1).

2. Nitration: since the ketone is a meta director, the nitro group would be added at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

3. Then, bromination: the ring now has COCH3 (1) and NO2 (3). The next substituent (Br) would be added where? The existing substituents are both meta directors.

The nitro group (3) would direct incoming groups to position 6 and position 5 (wait, are those the meta positions? Position 3: meta is positions 6 and 5? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, considering acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1), the nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to COCH3). Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 3.

Next, bromination: the existing substituents are at 1 and 3. Each is a meta director, so the next substituent could be at position 5, which is meta to both. So position 5 would be where Br adds.

So now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), and 5 (Br). But wait, the target has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So in this case, the nitro is at 3 and Br at 5, but the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So this approach leads to substituents at 3 (nitro) and 5 (Br), but the target has them swapped.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the target has the Br at 3 and the nitro at 5. So in the order I did, the nitro is at 3, and Br at 5. So that's opposite.

So perhaps I should reverse the order of nitration and bromination.

Let me try again:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Bromination: since the ketone is a meta director, Br adds at position 3.

3. Nitration: the ring now has ketone (1) and Br (3). The nitro group would be added where? The Br is at 3, which is a meta director. So nitration would add at position 5 (meta to Br) and position 6 (ortho to Br, but that's unlikely because Br is an EWG and meta direction dominates).

So the nitro would add at position 5. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which matches the target structure.

So the steps are: acylation, bromination, nitration.

Wait, but that can't be right because after bromination, the ring has Br, which is a meta director. So the nitration would add in a position meta to Br, which is position 5.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the order of reactions is:

- Friedel-Crafts acylation (to introduce COCH3 at position 1).

- Bromination (introduce Br at position 3).

- Nitration (introduce NO2 at position 5).

So looking at the options, which sequence includes these steps in this order.

But wait, let's look at the options.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), then Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), then HNO3 again, etc. Hmm, that seems like nitration first, which doesn't fit because we can't do Friedel-Crafts after nitration because the ring is deactivated.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), then HNO3 (nitration), then CH3COCl (acylation). Wait, but if we do acylation last, but the ring is already nitrated and brominated, which are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation), ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). Then a few steps with Fe/HCl, HNO3, etc. But according to our earlier analysis, after acylation and bromination, nitration would add in the correct position. So let's see what the rest of the steps do.

Wait, but the target molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ethanone. So the steps after acylation, bromination, and nitration would be done. But the options may include more steps, like reduction or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each option includes more steps beyond the necessary, so I have to see which option correctly includes the necessary steps in the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the order is acylation, bromination, nitration. So the option that has these steps in order: first acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So the first three steps are correct. Then there are more steps, but perhaps those are not needed.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So after the three steps, the ring would have COCH3, Br, and NO2 at positions 1,3,5. So that's correct. So why would the options have more steps after that?

Alternatively, perhaps the options are longer because they include other steps, but the key is to find the correct order.

Wait, but looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of benzene. So benzene becomes bromobenzene. But benzene can undergo bromination, but if the next step is nitration, then the nitro would go meta to Br.

But then, acylation would come later, but the ring is already deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So that's not the correct path.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene. Benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

Then Fe/HCl: possibly a reduction step, like turning nitrobenzene into phenyl amine? But nitrobenzene is not easily reduced under those conditions. Alternatively, maybe demethylation or something else, but not sure.

Then CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation. But if the ring is already nitro-substituted, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this is not feasible.

Option D: i) nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), then H3PO2 (possibly for diazo to something else), then Br2/FeBr3, then acylation, then nitration again. Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acylate.

Wait, but we can't acylate after nitration because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

The target molecule has a ketone (COCH3), Br, and NO2 on the benzene ring at positions 1,3,5.

So the order of adding substituents must be such that the Friedel-Crafts acylation happens before any deactivating groups are introduced. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

So the correct order is:

1. Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) to add COCH3.

2. Bromination (directed meta to COCH3).

3. Nitration (directed meta to COCH3 and Br).

Wait, but when you have two substituents, the incoming group goes to a position that's meta to both, if possible.

So after acylation, the ring has COCH3 at 1.

Then bromination adds Br at 3.

Then nitration adds NO2 at 5.

So the steps are: Friedel-Crafts acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking for an option where these three steps come in this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. Then more steps.

But why would option A have more steps after that? Let me look.

Option A: Steps i through vii.

i) acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromo at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

Then step iv is Fe/HCl; v) HNO3 again; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, why would there be more steps after nitration? The target requires those substituents, so perhaps the additional steps are unnecessary, but perhaps the option is incorrect because it introduces more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct order of the first three steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C or D. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the order is acylation, nitration, bromination.

So after acylation, the ring is activated. Nitration adds nitro group meta, then bromination adds Br meta to the ketone and nitro.

Wait, but in that case, the nitro and Br would both be meta to the ketone, leading to positions 3 and 5.

Wait, but if I have ketone at 1, nitration would add nitro at 3, then bromination would be directed by both ketone and nitro.

But the nitro is a stronger director, so perhaps the Br would add at 5 (meta to nitro) or 5 (meta to ketone as well). So perhaps it would end up in position 5.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So this approach would lead to Br at 5 and nitro at 3, which is the opposite of the target.

Hence, earlier approach seems better: acylation first, then bromination, then nitration.

So looking for an option where the first three steps are acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking again, only option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

But option A includes more steps after that, which may not be necessary for the target molecule. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only the first three steps are relevant, and the rest may be part of the same process or perhaps are not needed.

Wait, but why would there be steps after nitration? The target has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. So after the first three steps, the molecule is done. So why does option A have more steps?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitrated, so meta to Br.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation.

But Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because it's deactivated.

So option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But Fe and HCl usually don't do that. Maybe it's a Birch reduction? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is being converted to something else. But then step iii is acylation. Since the ring is nitrated, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → unclear.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But on what? If we have nitrobenzene, perhaps it's introducing a diazo group, but I'm not sure.

iv) H3PO2 → maybe a reducing agent. Perhaps converting nitro to amine.

Wait, H3PO2 is used for controlled reduction, like reducing nitro groups to amine under specific conditions.

So step i: nitro group.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → Hmm, maybe a reduction step? Nitrobenzene to phenyl amine using H2/Pd? But Fe/HCl isn't a standard reducing agent for nitro groups. Alternatively, it could be a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's remember that the correct steps should be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Only option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. The rest of the steps in option A might be extra, but perhaps they are part of the synthesis.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have any additional groups. So perhaps option A is correct.

Wait, looking at option A's steps:

i) acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate to get 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

So that's the target, right? So why are there more steps after that?

Wait, perhaps the question says which sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps after nitration, some other steps are required, like protection, or perhaps the steps after are for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the nitro group is introduced first, then the bromine, then the ketone.

Wait, but that's not possible because Friedel-Crafts can't happen after nitration. So perhaps the only viable option is option A, even though it includes more steps.

Another possibility is that perhaps the substitution order is different. Maybe the nitro group is introduced before the bromine, but that would require the ring to be activated, which is not compatible with nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine. Let me think again.

If I have benzene, first brominate (FeBr3), then nitrate.

But wait, the bromine is a meta director. So nitration would add at position 5 relative to the Br (position 3). So the ring would have Br at 3, nitro at 5.

Then, acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would add the ketone at position 1, but wait, the ring is already deactivated by nitro group. So Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that approach is not feasible.

So, the only correct order is acylation first, then bromination, then nitration.

So option A has the first three steps in that order. But then why the rest of the steps?

Wait, perhaps the rest of the steps are for something else, but the target is achieved after the first three steps. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the target requires an additional reaction, like converting a nitro group to something else, but in the target, the nitro group remains. So no, the steps after nitration are unnecessary. So perhaps the correct option is option A, but only the first three steps are needed, and the rest are extra. But the question asks for the sequence that would lead to the target, so perhaps the rest of the steps are not relevant, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after the first three in option A are for protecting groups or work-up, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects again.

When we have a benzene ring with a ketone group (meta director), a nitro group (meta), and a bromine (meta), where would another substituent go?

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acylate. But I can't acylate after nitration because the ring is deactivated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via another method, like a substitution reaction, but that's not likely. Friedel-Crafts is the standard way to introduce ketones.

Wait, perhaps the target is synthesized via a benzene ring that has a methyl group which is later oxidized. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done via a different method, but I think Friedel-Crafts is the way to go.

Another thought: perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine. Let me imagine that.

But that's not possible because the ring would have Br and ketone, both meta directors. So nitration would add nitro at position 5.

Wait, so the steps would be: acylation → bromination → nitration.

Which is the same as before.

So the correct option is option A, which has these three steps in order, even though the option includes more steps.

But wait, looking again at the options, perhaps one of the other options includes only the necessary steps.

Wait, the question says "which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis". So perhaps each option provides a complete synthetic route, and I have to choose the one that correctly builds the target.

Looking at option A's steps beyond nitration:

iv) Fe/HCl → Maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that's not part of the target.

v) HNO3 again → Re-nitration? But the ring is already nitrated.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → Reduction.

Hmm, perhaps this is a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one because the first three steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is option C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → Maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation.

Wait, but if the ring has an amine group, can Friedel-Crafts proceed? Because amines are strong activating groups, so Friedel-Crafts could work.

Wait, if step ii reduces nitro to amine (NH2 group), then step iii would be acylation. But then, after acylation, the ring has NH2 and COCH3 groups.

But then, perhaps bromination would be done next, directed by the amine group (which is an ortho/para director). Wait, but acylation would make the ring have a meta director (COCH3) and an amine (ortho/para). So perhaps the Br would add in a position influenced by both.

This seems complicated, but perhaps the steps in option C are not in the correct order.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the positions again.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetone.

So, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3).

So, the order is to add COCH3 first, then Br, then NO2.

Which is exactly what option A does in the first three steps.

So, after these three steps, the target is achieved.

But the option has more steps after that, which may or may not be part of the synthesis. But the question is about the sequence leading to the target, so perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but in the first three steps, after nitration, the target is achieved. So perhaps the additional steps in option A are for another purpose, but they are not part of the minimal steps. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to see which option correctly describes the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, option C's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction to aniline.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation to acetophenone with NH2 group.

Wait, but the ring now has NH2 (strong activating) and COCH3 (deactivating). So when adding Br, where would it go? The NH2 is ortho/para director, and COCH3 is meta. So Br would add in a position that's ortho to NH2 and meta to COCH3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach won't give the correct substituents.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction of diazo to something else.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems like a lot of steps, but perhaps the order is: nitro, then amine, then diazo, then something else, then bromination, then acylation, then nitration again. But the target doesn't have more nitro groups, so I'm not sure.

Overall, I'm starting to think that option A is the correct one because the first three steps are the correct order to add the substituents. The additional steps may not be necessary or may be part of a different synthetic pathway, but the question is about the sequence leading to the target, which is achieved in the first three steps of option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (COCH3, Br, and NO2) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The ketone group (COCH3) is a meta-director, and the nitro group (NO2) and bromine (Br) are also meta-directors. The target molecule has the ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5, making it a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone group (COCH3) at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine at position 3, meta to the ketone.  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group at position 5, meta to both the ketone and bromine.  
   - The first three steps correctly produce the target molecule. The additional steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target compound but may represent extra processing steps.  

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine to benzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group meta to bromine.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) attempts to introduce the ketone.  
   - This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration, as the nitro group deactivates the benzene ring.  

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (NH2).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone.  
   - This sequence is incorrect because the nitro group deactivates the benzene ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible.  

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (NH2).  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and reduction (H3PO2) modify the amine.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine.  
   - **Step v**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone.  
   - **Step vi**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) re-introduces the nitro group.  
   - This sequence is overly complex and does not align with the target molecule, as it involves multiple unnecessary steps and re-introduces the nitro group.  

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option A**, where the ketone is introduced first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct order to achieve the target molecule. While additional steps are included in Option A, the first three steps are sufficient to synthesize the target compound.  

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. The main ring is a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. Wait, the ketone is on the ethanone part. Oh wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure is a benzene ring attached to a ketone (CO) group, with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, no. Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the benzene ring. The ring has a bromo group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5 relative to the point where the ketone is attached. So the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So the numbering would be: the ketone is on carbon 1, then the ring positions are 3 and 5. So the substituents are meta to each other but on the benzene ring.

So the benzene has three substituents: a ketone (as a substituent), a bromine, and a nitro group. Wait, no, the ketone is part of the side chain. Let me think again. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. The ethanone is CH3CO-. So the structure is Ph-CO-CH3, where Ph is the 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group.

So the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point where the COCH3 group is attached. So the COCH3 is at position 1 (assuming the numbering starts there), then bromo is at position 3, nitro at position 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So we have a benzene ring with substituents in the 1,3,5 positions? Wait, no. Wait, the COCH3 is at position 1, and the substituents are at 3 and 5. So that's two substituents on the ring, not three. So the ring has three substituents: the COCH3 group, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So it's a meta-substituted pattern relative to the ketone.

So, starting from benzene, I need to introduce these substituents in the correct positions. The question is about the sequence of reactions that would yield this compound in high yield.

So the synthesis steps involve several reactions: bromination, nitration, acetylation, and maybe some substitutions or reductions.

I know that directing groups are important here. Nitro groups are strong meta directors, while bromine (as a substituent) is also a meta director. Acetyl groups (from ketones) are also meta directors in electrophilic substitution reactions.

But wait, the ketone (COCH3) is an electron-withdrawing group. So it would direct incoming substituents to the meta position.

Wait, but the COCH3 group is attached to the benzene. So when we add the Br and the nitro group, their positions depend on the directing effect of the existing substituents.

Let me think about the order in which these substituents are added because the order will affect the positions where the next substituents attach.

Option A: The steps are CH3COCl/AlCl3; then Br2/FeBr3; then HNO3/H2SO4; then Fe/HCl; then HNO3 again; etc. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check each option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible steps needed.

First, benzene can be acetylated to form acetophenone (phenyl ketone). Then, we need to introduce substituents at the meta positions relative to the ketone. But wait, if the ketone is already present, any subsequent nitration or bromination would occur at the meta positions relative to it.

Wait, but the target has two substituents: Br and nitro. So perhaps the steps involve adding these substituents in the correct order, considering their directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced last. Because when adding nitro groups, which are strong meta directors, the positions might influence where other groups go.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituents and their order.

The target has a nitro group and a bromine in the meta positions relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is the last group added? Or maybe it's the first.

Wait, the ketone is part of the ethanone, so it's attached via the benzene ring. So perhaps the order is to first add the nitro group, then bromine, then the acetyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced first, then the other substituents.

Wait, let me think about each possible option.

Looking at option D: The steps are HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?); NaNO2/HCl (another nitration? Or diazotization?); H3PO2 (probably a reducing agent, like for hydrolysis). Then Br2/FeBr3, then CH3COCl/AlCl3, then HNO3 again. Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe not the right order.

Alternatively, let's think about how to get the substituents in the correct positions.

If we start by nitration, the nitro group would be added in a certain position. Then bromination, but the directing effect would depend on the existing groups.

Wait, but the target has two substituents: Br and nitro. Let me think about their positions. The ketone is the main substituent, so perhaps the nitro and Br are introduced before the ketone?

Wait, no. Because the ketone is part of the ethanone side chain. So the benzene ring has the COCH3 group attached, which directs incoming substituents to meta positions.

But wait, if I first introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, and then the ketone, maybe the positions would be correct.

Wait, let me model this.

Suppose we start with benzene.

Step 1: Nitration. Benzene → nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director.

Step 2: Bromination with FeBr3. Nitro groups direct meta. So in nitrobenzene, adding Br would go to the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, nitrobenzene has the nitro group in position 1. Adding Br would go to position 3 or 5? Wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 3 and 5 are equivalent in the case of mono-substituted. So Br would add at position 3.

So now the benzene has nitro in position 1 and Br in position 3. Wait, no. Wait, nitro is in position 1; bromination would add in meta, which is position 3 or 5. But benzene is symmetric, so it doesn't matter which one because they're the same.

Wait, but then we need to add the ketone group. Where would that go?

Wait, but the ketone is a substituent attached to the benzene. So perhaps next, we add the ketone group in a position that's influenced by the existing substituents.

But wait, the existing substituents are nitro and Br, which are both meta directors. So adding another group would be directed by these.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. However, nitro groups deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult or impossible. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to the benzene ring, but benzene with deactivating groups (like nitro) won't undergo Friedel-Crafts easily because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, so that complicates things. So perhaps the order must be such that the acylation (adding the ketone) happens before any deactivating groups are introduced.

Wait, that makes sense because Friedel-Crafts can't happen if the ring is deactivated.

So perhaps the ketone (COCH3) must be introduced first.

So first, benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone (the ketone attached to benzene). Then, the next substituents can be added, but since the ketone is a meta director, the nitro and bromine would be added in the meta positions relative to it.

Wait, but then we have two substituents: nitro and Br. So after the ketone, the next step would be to nitrate. Nitration would occur meta to the ketone.

So acetophenone's structure is Ph-COCH3. When nitrated, the nitro group would add meta to the ketone, so at position 3 relative to the ketone.

Then, the next substituent would be bromine. Now, after nitration, the benzene has two substituents: ketone and nitro, both meta directors. So adding Br would be influenced by these.

Wait, but wait: the nitro group is a strong meta director. The ketone is also a meta director. So when adding the bromine, where would it go?

The ketone is at position 1; nitro is at position 3. So the ring positions available would be positions 5, 4, 2, etc., depending on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the positions. Let's say the ketone is at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone). Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 3. The next step would be bromination; where would Br add?

The existing substituents are the ketone (1) and nitro (3). Both are meta directors. So for bromination, the incoming Br would be directed to the remaining available positions. Let's see: in a benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 3, the next substituent would be added based on the directors.

Wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director, so it would direct incoming groups to its meta position, which is position 5 (since it's at 3). Alternatively, the ketone at position 1 is a meta director, so would direct to position 5 as well, since position 3 is already taken.

Wait, maybe in this scenario, the Br would add at position 5, which is meta to both. So the ring would have substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), and 5 (Br). But wait, our target only has two substituents: Br and nitro, with the ketone. So maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration and bromination steps are done in a different order.

Wait, perhaps after the ketone is added, bromination is done next. So:

Step 1: Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1).

Step 2: Bromination. Since the ketone is a meta director, the Br would add at position 3.

Now, the ring has COCH3 (1) and Br (3).

Next, nitration: the nitro group would be added meta to the ketone, which is at position 3, but that position is already taken by Br. So where else can it go? Alternatively, the nitration would be directed by the Br.

Wait, but Br is a meta director as well. So the nitro group would be added at position 5, relative to the Br (position 3). So nitration would add at position 5, which is meta to Br and also meta to the ketone.

Wait, wait, the ketone is at 1, Br at 3. The nitro group could add at position 5, which is meta to both.

So the ring would have substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). But our target molecule only has two substituents on the ring: Br and nitro. So perhaps this approach leads to three substituents, which isn't the case.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back to the target molecule.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is connected to the ethanone, so the ring has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So the ring has three substituents: the ethanone group (position 1), Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait a second, that's three substituents on the benzene ring! So perhaps the earlier assumption that the ring only has two substituents was wrong. So the ring has the ethanone group (position 1), Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5. So it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, that's a possibility. So I need to add substituents at positions 1,3,5.

Wait, but the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, which would add the substituent at position 1. Then, the next substituents (Br and nitro) are added at 3 and 5.

So the question is, how to get these substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think again. Steps would be:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1).

2. Nitration: since the ketone is a meta director, the nitro group would be added at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

3. Then, bromination: the ring now has COCH3 (1) and NO2 (3). The next substituent (Br) would be added where? The existing substituents are both meta directors.

The nitro group (3) would direct incoming groups to position 6 and position 5 (wait, are those the meta positions? Position 3: meta is positions 6 and 5? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, considering acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1), the nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to COCH3). Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 3.

Next, bromination: the existing substituents are at 1 and 3. Each is a meta director, so the next substituent could be at position 5, which is meta to both. So position 5 would be where Br adds.

So now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), and 5 (Br). But wait, the target has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So in this case, the nitro is at 3 and Br at 5, but the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So this approach leads to substituents at 3 (nitro) and 5 (Br), but the target has them swapped.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the target has the Br at 3 and the nitro at 5. So in the order I did, the nitro is at 3, and Br at 5. So that's opposite.

So perhaps I should reverse the order of nitration and bromination.

Let me try again:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Bromination: since the ketone is a meta director, Br adds at position 3.

3. Nitration: the ring now has ketone (1) and Br (3). The nitro group would be added where? The Br is at 3, which is a meta director. So nitration would add at position 5 (meta to Br) and position 6 (ortho to Br, but that's unlikely because Br is an EWG and meta direction dominates).

So the nitro would add at position 5. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which matches the target structure.

So the steps are: acylation, bromination, nitration.

Wait, but that can't be right because after bromination, the ring has Br, which is a meta director. So the nitration would add in a position meta to Br, which is position 5.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the order of reactions is:

- Friedel-Crafts acylation (to introduce COCH3 at position 1).

- Bromination (introduce Br at position 3).

- Nitration (introduce NO2 at position 5).

So looking at the options, which sequence includes these steps in this order.

But wait, let's look at the options.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), then Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), then HNO3 again, etc. Hmm, that seems like nitration first, which doesn't fit because we can't do Friedel-Crafts after nitration because the ring is deactivated.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), then HNO3 (nitration), then CH3COCl (acylation). Wait, but if we do acylation last, but the ring is already nitrated and brominated, which are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation), ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). Then a few steps with Fe/HCl, HNO3, etc. But according to our earlier analysis, after acylation and bromination, nitration would add in the correct position. So let's see what the rest of the steps do.

Wait, but the target molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ethanone. So the steps after acylation, bromination, and nitration would be done. But the options may include more steps, like reduction or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each option includes more steps beyond the necessary, so I have to see which option correctly includes the necessary steps in the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the order is acylation, bromination, nitration. So the option that has these steps in order: first acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So the first three steps are correct. Then there are more steps, but perhaps those are not needed.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So after the three steps, the ring would have COCH3, Br, and NO2 at positions 1,3,5. So that's correct. So why would the options have more steps after that?

Alternatively, perhaps the options are longer because they include other steps, but the key is to find the correct order.

Wait, but looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of benzene. So benzene becomes bromobenzene. But benzene can undergo bromination, but if the next step is nitration, then the nitro would go meta to Br.

But then, acylation would come later, but the ring is already deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So that's not the correct path.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene. Benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

Then Fe/HCl: possibly a reduction step, like turning nitrobenzene into phenyl amine? But nitrobenzene is not easily reduced under those conditions. Alternatively, maybe demethylation or something else, but not sure.

Then CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation. But if the ring is already nitro-substituted, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this is not feasible.

Option D: i) nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), then H3PO2 (possibly for diazo to something else), then Br2/FeBr3, then acylation, then nitration again. Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acylate.

Wait, but we can't acylate after nitration because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

The target molecule has a ketone (COCH3), Br, and NO2 on the benzene ring at positions 1,3,5.

So the order of adding substituents must be such that the Friedel-Crafts acylation happens before any deactivating groups are introduced. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

So the correct order is:

1. Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) to add COCH3.

2. Bromination (directed meta to COCH3).

3. Nitration (directed meta to COCH3 and Br).

Wait, but when you have two substituents, the incoming group goes to a position that's meta to both, if possible.

So after acylation, the ring has COCH3 at 1.

Then bromination adds Br at 3.

Then nitration adds NO2 at 5.

So the steps are: Friedel-Crafts acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking for an option where these three steps come in this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. Then more steps.

But why would option A have more steps after that? Let me look.

Option A: Steps i through vii.

i) acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromo at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

Then step iv is Fe/HCl; v) HNO3 again; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, why would there be more steps after nitration? The target requires those substituents, so perhaps the additional steps are unnecessary, but perhaps the option is incorrect because it introduces more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct order of the first three steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C or D. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the order is acylation, nitration, bromination.

So after acylation, the ring is activated. Nitration adds nitro group meta, then bromination adds Br meta to the ketone and nitro.

Wait, but in that case, the nitro and Br would both be meta to the ketone, leading to positions 3 and 5.

Wait, but if I have ketone at 1, nitration would add nitro at 3, then bromination would be directed by both ketone and nitro.

But the nitro is a stronger director, so perhaps the Br would add at 5 (meta to nitro) or 5 (meta to ketone as well). So perhaps it would end up in position 5.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So this approach would lead to Br at 5 and nitro at 3, which is the opposite of the target.

Hence, earlier approach seems better: acylation first, then bromination, then nitration.

So looking for an option where the first three steps are acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking again, only option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

But option A includes more steps after that, which may not be necessary for the target molecule. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only the first three steps are relevant, and the rest may be part of the same process or perhaps are not needed.

Wait, but why would there be steps after nitration? The target has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. So after the first three steps, the molecule is done. So why does option A have more steps?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitrated, so meta to Br.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation.

But Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because it's deactivated.

So option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But Fe and HCl usually don't do that. Maybe it's a Birch reduction? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is being converted to something else. But then step iii is acylation. Since the ring is nitrated, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → unclear.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But on what? If we have nitrobenzene, perhaps it's introducing a diazo group, but I'm not sure.

iv) H3PO2 → maybe a reducing agent. Perhaps converting nitro to amine.

Wait, H3PO2 is used for controlled reduction, like reducing nitro groups to amine under specific conditions.

So step i: nitro group.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → Hmm, maybe a reduction step? Nitrobenzene to phenyl amine using H2/Pd? But Fe/HCl isn't a standard reducing agent for nitro groups. Alternatively, it could be a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's remember that the correct steps should be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Only option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. The rest of the steps in option A might be extra, but perhaps they are part of the synthesis.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have any additional groups. So perhaps option A is correct.

Wait, looking at option A's steps:

i) acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate to get 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

So that's the target, right? So why are there more steps after that?

Wait, perhaps the question says which sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps after nitration, some other steps are required, like protection, or perhaps the steps after are for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the nitro group is introduced first, then the bromine, then the ketone.

Wait, but that's not possible because Friedel-Crafts can't happen after nitration. So perhaps the only viable option is option A, even though it includes more steps.

Another possibility is that perhaps the substitution order is different. Maybe the nitro group is introduced before the bromine, but that would require the ring to be activated, which is not compatible with nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine. Let me think again.

If I have benzene, first brominate (FeBr3), then nitrate.

But wait, the bromine is a meta director. So nitration would add at position 5 relative to the Br (position 3). So the ring would have Br at 3, nitro at 5.

Then, acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would add the ketone at position 1, but wait, the ring is already deactivated by nitro group. So Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that approach is not feasible.

So, the only correct order is acylation first, then bromination, then nitration.

So option A has the first three steps in that order. But then why the rest of the steps?

Wait, perhaps the rest of the steps are for something else, but the target is achieved after the first three steps. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the target requires an additional reaction, like converting a nitro group to something else, but in the target, the nitro group remains. So no, the steps after nitration are unnecessary. So perhaps the correct option is option A, but only the first three steps are needed, and the rest are extra. But the question asks for the sequence that would lead to the target, so perhaps the rest of the steps are not relevant, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after the first three in option A are for protecting groups or work-up, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects again.

When we have a benzene ring with a ketone group (meta director), a nitro group (meta), and a bromine (meta), where would another substituent go?

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acylate. But I can't acylate after nitration because the ring is deactivated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via another method, like a substitution reaction, but that's not likely. Friedel-Crafts is the standard way to introduce ketones.

Wait, perhaps the target is synthesized via a benzene ring that has a methyl group which is later oxidized. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done via a different method, but I think Friedel-Crafts is the way to go.

Another thought: perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine. Let me imagine that.

But that's not possible because the ring would have Br and ketone, both meta directors. So nitration would add nitro at position 5.

Wait, so the steps would be: acylation → bromination → nitration.

Which is the same as before.

So the correct option is option A, which has these three steps in order, even though the option includes more steps.

But wait, looking again at the options, perhaps one of the other options includes only the necessary steps.

Wait, the question says "which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis". So perhaps each option provides a complete synthetic route, and I have to choose the one that correctly builds the target.

Looking at option A's steps beyond nitration:

iv) Fe/HCl → Maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that's not part of the target.

v) HNO3 again → Re-nitration? But the ring is already nitrated.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → Reduction.

Hmm, perhaps this is a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one because the first three steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is option C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → Maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation.

Wait, but if the ring has an amine group, can Friedel-Crafts proceed? Because amines are strong activating groups, so Friedel-Crafts could work.

Wait, if step ii reduces nitro to amine (NH2 group), then step iii would be acylation. But then, after acylation, the ring has NH2 and COCH3 groups.

But then, perhaps bromination would be done next, directed by the amine group (which is an ortho/para director). Wait, but acylation would make the ring have a meta director (COCH3) and an amine (ortho/para). So perhaps the Br would add in a position influenced by both.

This seems complicated, but perhaps the steps in option C are not in the correct order.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the positions again.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetone.

So, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3).

So, the order is to add COCH3 first, then Br, then NO2.

Which is exactly what option A does in the first three steps.

So, after these three steps, the target is achieved.

But the option has more steps after that, which may or may not be part of the synthesis. But the question is about the sequence leading to the target, so perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but in the first three steps, after nitration, the target is achieved. So perhaps the additional steps in option A are for another purpose, but they are not part of the minimal steps. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to see which option correctly describes the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, option C's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction to aniline.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation to acetophenone with NH2 group.

Wait, but the ring now has NH2 (strong activating) and COCH3 (deactivating). So when adding Br, where would it go? The NH2 is ortho/para director, and COCH3 is meta. So Br would add in a position that's ortho to NH2 and meta to COCH3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach won't give the correct substituents.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction of diazo to something else.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems like a lot of steps, but perhaps the order is: nitro, then amine, then diazo, then something else, then bromination, then acylation, then nitration again. But the target doesn't have more nitro groups, so I'm not sure.

Overall, I'm starting to think that option A is the correct one because the first three steps are the correct order to add the substituents. The additional steps may not be necessary or may be part of a different synthetic pathway, but the question is about the sequence leading to the target, which is achieved in the first three steps of option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (COCH3, Br, and NO2) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The ketone group (COCH3) is a meta-director, and the nitro group (NO2) and bromine (Br) are also meta-directors. The target molecule has the ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5, making it a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone group (COCH3) at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine at position 3, meta to the ketone.  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group at position 5, meta to both the ketone and bromine.  
   - The first three steps correctly produce the target molecule. The additional steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target compound but may represent extra processing steps.  

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine to benzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group meta to bromine.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) attempts to introduce the ketone.  
   - This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration, as the nitro group deactivates the benzene ring.  

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (NH2).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone.  
   - This sequence is incorrect because the nitro group deactivates the benzene ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible.  

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (NH2).  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and reduction (H3PO2) modify the amine.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine.  
   - **Step v**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone.  
   - **Step vi**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) re-introduces the nitro group.  
   - This sequence is overly complex and does not align with the target molecule, as it involves multiple unnecessary steps and re-introduces the nitro group.  

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option A**, where the ketone is introduced first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct order to achieve the target molecule. While additional steps are included in Option A, the first three steps are sufficient to synthesize the target compound.
