Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a particular operator. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The operator in question is P, and it's a vector operator, so I suppose it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem says that the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of angular momentum operators are usually ħ times some integer or half-integer value. So here, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which suggests that the operator P might be related to spin, maybe the spin-1/2 operator, since for spin-1/2, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

The problem is asking about the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction is somewhere in the x-z plane, meaning the angle theta (in spherical coordinates) would be between 0 and pi/2 radians, I think, because the y-component is zero—since n lies in x-z, phi would be 0 or pi, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we can express it in terms of theta.

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z. So the general operator P along n would be P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) dot n, right? So if n is a unit vector, say (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in x-z plane, sinθ sinφ would be zero, so n would be (sinθ cos0, 0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, but I think it's just phi=0 here because it's arbitrary direction, but maybe it doesn't matter. Hmm, but since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, maybe we can parameterize it with theta and phi being 0.

Wait, but the eigenvector direction is along n, so the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, where P is the component of the vector P in the direction of n.

Wait, wait, no. The operator in question is P, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so I think P is the component of the operator in the direction of n. Or wait, perhaps the operator is the total P vector, and the eigenvector is for the component along n. Alternatively, maybe the operator is the component P_n = P ⋅ n.

I think the operator in question is the component of P along n. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the operator is P ⋅ n, and its eigenvalue is ħ/2.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators usually have eigenvalues of the form mħ, where m is an integer or half-integer. So in this case, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which suggests that the operator P is acting on a spin-1/2 system.

So, I need to find the eigenstates of P ⋅ n. But the question gives us the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as matrices. So perhaps I can express P ⋅ n as a matrix and then find its eigenvectors.

But wait, let's read the problem again. The operator is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the vector n has components (nx, ny, nz), where ny=0 because it's in x-z. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

But the problem doesn't specify the angle of n. So perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of theta, but the options have different forms. Alternatively, maybe the direction is arbitrary, but the eigenvectors are given in terms of some angles.

Wait, another approach: since the eigenvector is for the operator P ⋅ n, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2, perhaps the eigenvector is aligned along n. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along a given axis.

But let's think about the components of P. The problem provides P_x, P_y, P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, yes. Let me write that down.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So each P_i is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix σ_i.

So the operator P ⋅ n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0. So it becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Let me denote the angle of n in the x-z plane as θ, such that n_x = sinθ (assuming polar angle θ from the z-axis) and n_z = cosθ.

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

So the matrix form of P_n is (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Wait, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them gives [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Multiply by ħ/2.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue for P_n is ħ/2, so we have:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Hmm, so let's denote the matrix M as [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

So the equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v> → M |v> = |v>.

So the matrix M has eigenvalues 1 and -1, because the eigenvalues of P_n must be ± (ħ/2), and in this case, the problem says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so M |v> = |v>.

So the eigenvector is the eigenvector of M with eigenvalue 1.

Now, let me find the eigenvectors of M.

The matrix M is:

[ cosθ   sinθ ]
[ sinθ  -cosθ ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(M - λ I) = 0.

So, determinant is:

cosθ - λ   sinθ
sinθ       -cosθ - λ

The determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sinθ sinθ.

Expanding this:

= (-cosθ (cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ)) ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute it correctly.

Wait, the determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - (sinθ)(sinθ).

Multiply out the first term: (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-λ) + (-λ)(-cosθ) + (-λ)(-λ) → -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ² → -cos²θ + λ².

Then subtract sin²θ:

So determinant = (-cos²θ + λ²) - sin²θ = λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² - 1.

So the eigenvalues are λ = ±1.

So for λ=1, the eigenvector equation is (M - I)|v> =0.

So M - I is:

[ cosθ -1    sinθ       ]
[ sinθ      -cosθ -1 ]

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0

From the first equation, (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → sinθ v2 = (1 - cosθ) v1 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Hmm, but (1 - cosθ) / sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2). Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2).

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

Let me write the eigenvector as [v1, v2] = v1 [1, tan(theta/2) ].

We can choose v1 as a normalization factor, perhaps 1/sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ), because the eigenvector needs to be normalized.

Wait, but 1 + tan²(theta/2) = sec²(theta/2), so sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) )= sec(theta/2) = 1/cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector would be:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait. Because:

If v2 = tan(theta/2) v1, then the vector is v1 [1, tan(theta/2)].

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 (1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = 1.

So v1^2 (1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) =1 → v1^2 (sec²(theta/2)) )=1 → v1^2 = cos²(theta/2) → v1 = cos(theta/2), assuming positive (since eigenvectors can be multiplied by any scalar, we can choose the positive root for simplicity).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let me check the second equation to make sure.

The second equation is sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0.

Substituting v2 = tan(theta/2) v1:

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) tan(theta/2) v1 =0.

Factor out v1:

[ sinθ + (-cosθ -1) tan(theta/2) ] =0.

Let me compute this:

sinθ + (-cosθ -1) [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ) ].

Let me write everything in terms of theta/2.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).
cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So (-cosθ -1) = -(2 cos²(theta/2) -1) -1 = -2 cos²(theta/2) +1 -1 = -2 cos²(theta/2).

So substituting all terms:

2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + [ -2 cos²(theta/2) ] * [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ) ].

Simplify:

First term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Second term: -2 cos²(theta/2) * [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] = -2 cos(theta/2) sin(theta/2)

Adding them: 2 sin cos - 2 sin cos = 0. So the equation holds. So the solution is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options given are in terms of hbar, but I thought we're dealing with spin-1/2, so maybe the eigenvectors are in terms of spinor components, which don't have hbar in them. Because the operator is dimensionless (since it's in units where ħ is present in the operator). So let me look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ), which seems to have hbar terms, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, but the operator is given in terms of ħ/2. So the operator itself has dimensions of ħ, but the eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space; their components are dimensionless.

So the eigenvectors shouldn't have any hbar factors. So option C is looking correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonics form for a state on a sphere. But our eigenvector is for a spin-1/2 system, which is a two-component spinor. So perhaps that's related to the direction of the spin in space, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the eigenvector in terms of spin-up in the direction n, which is in x-z plane. So the spinor components should be expressed in terms of theta, the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but for spin-1/2, the spin-up state along a direction (theta, phi) is given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So phi=0, so the spinor becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C.

But let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the normalized eigenvector, so option C is a normalized vector since cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is one of the choices. So the correct answer is option C.

But another possibility: perhaps the operator is (P_x, P_y, P_z), and the eigenvector is for P_x + P_z or something like that. But no, the operator is for the component along n.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the operator. Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P ⋅ n is the component along n.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm looking at the right thing. The problem says: calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the operator is P, but the direction is n. So it's the component of P along n.

So the operator is (P ⋅ n), which I've correctly written as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

So I think my initial approach is correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C says exactly that. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is then:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting these matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$ are $\pm 1$. For the eigenvalue $+1$, the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0.
\]

From this equation, we find:

\[
v_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1.
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**, which is:

\[
\left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right).
\]

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector components in this context.  
- **B** corresponds to spherical harmonics, which is not the correct form for a spin-1/2 eigenvector.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a particular operator. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The operator in question is P, and it's a vector operator, so I suppose it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem says that the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of angular momentum operators are usually ħ times some integer or half-integer value. So here, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which suggests that the operator P might be related to spin, maybe the spin-1/2 operator, since for spin-1/2, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

The problem is asking about the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction is somewhere in the x-z plane, meaning the angle theta (in spherical coordinates) would be between 0 and pi/2 radians, I think, because the y-component is zero—since n lies in x-z, phi would be 0 or pi, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we can express it in terms of theta.

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z. So the general operator P along n would be P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) dot n, right? So if n is a unit vector, say (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in x-z plane, sinθ sinφ would be zero, so n would be (sinθ cos0, 0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, but I think it's just phi=0 here because it's arbitrary direction, but maybe it doesn't matter. Hmm, but since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, maybe we can parameterize it with theta and phi being 0.

Wait, but the eigenvector direction is along n, so the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, where P is the component of the vector P in the direction of n.

Wait, wait, no. The operator in question is P, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so I think P is the component of the operator in the direction of n. Or wait, perhaps the operator is the total P vector, and the eigenvector is for the component along n. Alternatively, maybe the operator is the component P_n = P ⋅ n.

I think the operator in question is the component of P along n. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the operator is P ⋅ n, and its eigenvalue is ħ/2.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators usually have eigenvalues of the form mħ, where m is an integer or half-integer. So in this case, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which suggests that the operator P is acting on a spin-1/2 system.

So, I need to find the eigenstates of P ⋅ n. But the question gives us the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as matrices. So perhaps I can express P ⋅ n as a matrix and then find its eigenvectors.

But wait, let's read the problem again. The operator is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the vector n has components (nx, ny, nz), where ny=0 because it's in x-z. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

But the problem doesn't specify the angle of n. So perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of theta, but the options have different forms. Alternatively, maybe the direction is arbitrary, but the eigenvectors are given in terms of some angles.

Wait, another approach: since the eigenvector is for the operator P ⋅ n, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2, perhaps the eigenvector is aligned along n. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along a given axis.

But let's think about the components of P. The problem provides P_x, P_y, P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, yes. Let me write that down.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So each P_i is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix σ_i.

So the operator P ⋅ n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0. So it becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Let me denote the angle of n in the x-z plane as θ, such that n_x = sinθ (assuming polar angle θ from the z-axis) and n_z = cosθ.

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

So the matrix form of P_n is (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Wait, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them gives [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Multiply by ħ/2.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue for P_n is ħ/2, so we have:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Hmm, so let's denote the matrix M as [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

So the equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v> → M |v> = |v>.

So the matrix M has eigenvalues 1 and -1, because the eigenvalues of P_n must be ± (ħ/2), and in this case, the problem says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so M |v> = |v>.

So the eigenvector is the eigenvector of M with eigenvalue 1.

Now, let me find the eigenvectors of M.

The matrix M is:

[ cosθ   sinθ ]
[ sinθ  -cosθ ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(M - λ I) = 0.

So, determinant is:

cosθ - λ   sinθ
sinθ       -cosθ - λ

The determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sinθ sinθ.

Expanding this:

= (-cosθ (cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ)) ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute it correctly.

Wait, the determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - (sinθ)(sinθ).

Multiply out the first term: (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-λ) + (-λ)(-cosθ) + (-λ)(-λ) → -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ² → -cos²θ + λ².

Then subtract sin²θ:

So determinant = (-cos²θ + λ²) - sin²θ = λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² - 1.

So the eigenvalues are λ = ±1.

So for λ=1, the eigenvector equation is (M - I)|v> =0.

So M - I is:

[ cosθ -1    sinθ       ]
[ sinθ      -cosθ -1 ]

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0

From the first equation, (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → sinθ v2 = (1 - cosθ) v1 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Hmm, but (1 - cosθ) / sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2). Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2).

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

Let me write the eigenvector as [v1, v2] = v1 [1, tan(theta/2) ].

We can choose v1 as a normalization factor, perhaps 1/sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ), because the eigenvector needs to be normalized.

Wait, but 1 + tan²(theta/2) = sec²(theta/2), so sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) )= sec(theta/2) = 1/cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector would be:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait. Because:

If v2 = tan(theta/2) v1, then the vector is v1 [1, tan(theta/2)].

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 (1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = 1.

So v1^2 (1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) =1 → v1^2 (sec²(theta/2)) )=1 → v1^2 = cos²(theta/2) → v1 = cos(theta/2), assuming positive (since eigenvectors can be multiplied by any scalar, we can choose the positive root for simplicity).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let me check the second equation to make sure.

The second equation is sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0.

Substituting v2 = tan(theta/2) v1:

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) tan(theta/2) v1 =0.

Factor out v1:

[ sinθ + (-cosθ -1) tan(theta/2) ] =0.

Let me compute this:

sinθ + (-cosθ -1) [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ) ].

Let me write everything in terms of theta/2.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).
cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So (-cosθ -1) = -(2 cos²(theta/2) -1) -1 = -2 cos²(theta/2) +1 -1 = -2 cos²(theta/2).

So substituting all terms:

2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + [ -2 cos²(theta/2) ] * [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ) ].

Simplify:

First term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Second term: -2 cos²(theta/2) * [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] = -2 cos(theta/2) sin(theta/2)

Adding them: 2 sin cos - 2 sin cos = 0. So the equation holds. So the solution is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options given are in terms of hbar, but I thought we're dealing with spin-1/2, so maybe the eigenvectors are in terms of spinor components, which don't have hbar in them. Because the operator is dimensionless (since it's in units where ħ is present in the operator). So let me look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ), which seems to have hbar terms, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, but the operator is given in terms of ħ/2. So the operator itself has dimensions of ħ, but the eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space; their components are dimensionless.

So the eigenvectors shouldn't have any hbar factors. So option C is looking correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonics form for a state on a sphere. But our eigenvector is for a spin-1/2 system, which is a two-component spinor. So perhaps that's related to the direction of the spin in space, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the eigenvector in terms of spin-up in the direction n, which is in x-z plane. So the spinor components should be expressed in terms of theta, the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but for spin-1/2, the spin-up state along a direction (theta, phi) is given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So phi=0, so the spinor becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C.

But let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the normalized eigenvector, so option C is a normalized vector since cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is one of the choices. So the correct answer is option C.

But another possibility: perhaps the operator is (P_x, P_y, P_z), and the eigenvector is for P_x + P_z or something like that. But no, the operator is for the component along n.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the operator. Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P ⋅ n is the component along n.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm looking at the right thing. The problem says: calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the operator is P, but the direction is n. So it's the component of P along n.

So the operator is (P ⋅ n), which I've correctly written as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

So I think my initial approach is correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C says exactly that. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is then:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting these matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$ are $\pm 1$. For the eigenvalue $+1$, the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0.
\]

From this equation, we find:

\[
v_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1.
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**, which is:

\[
\left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right).
\]

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector components in this context.  
- **B** corresponds to spherical harmonics, which is not the correct form for a spin-1/2 eigenvector.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
