Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about quantum mechanics, which I find a bit tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state, which emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, isospin and other quantum numbers have to obey certain conservation laws, similar to angular momentum and parity.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which of the given partial waves is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me break down the information. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would be (2*0 +1) S0, which is ^1S0. That means the initial total spin S is 0, the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since S comes first?), and the total angular momentum J is 0.

Wait, no, the term symbol is in the order (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0: 1 is 2S+1 → S=0. L is S? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. No, wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So for 1S0, the 1 is (2S+1) → S=0. Then L is S? Wait, no, no. Let me correct that. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J. So in 1S0, the 1 is (2S+1) → S=0. The "S" here is the orbital angular momentum. Wait, no, wait. No, the L is the orbital part. Oh, right! So 1 is 2S+1, so S=0. Then the L is S (the letter), which is S=0 here? Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing up S in the term symbol. Let me get this right.

The term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. So for 1S0, the 1 is 2S+1 → S=0. The L is the orbital angular momentum part, which is S=0, so L=0. Then J is 0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.

The NN system emits a particle X. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when it's emitted, the parity of the system could change based on the angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, but the problem says to consider the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So I have to make sure that the total angular momentum and parity are conserved.

The Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L +1 (mod 2). Since the final NN state has T=0, we can plug that in. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ -1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must add up to an odd number.

So S + L must be odd. Let me think about that. So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even. But wait, spin and angular momentum are quantum numbers, so their integer values can be even or odd. Spin S can be integers, but for two nucleons, each with spin 1/2, the total spin S can be 0 or 1, right? Because for two spin-1/2 particles, combining them gives S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). So in the final state, S can be 0 or 1.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0. After emitting a particle, what happens to the spin? Hmm, the NN system's spin in the final state could change. But wait, the problem is about the emitted particle's angular momentum state, so maybe the NN's L and S in the final state are determined by the process.

Wait, particle X is emitted, so the initial state (before emission) is the NN system in 1S0. After emitting X, the NN system is in a state with certain L, S, and J, and X is in some angular momentum state l, etc.

But perhaps the way to approach this is to think about the process as a transition from the initial state (1S0) to a final NN state with T=0, and particle X emitted with some angular momentum l and spin s.

But maybe I should think about the conservation of angular momentum. So the initial total angular momentum J_initial is 0 (from the 1S0 state). After emission, the total angular momentum should still be J_initial. But the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN state's J and the emitted particle's j (angular momentum). Wait, but angular momentum is a vector, so it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial state's J is 0, so the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0. That would require that the sum of the angular momenta of the NN system and the emitted particle X is zero. But how?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the parity and angular momentum conservation. The initial state has parity P_initial. The final state (NN system) has parity P_NN, and the emitted particle X has parity P_X. The total parity after emission must equal the initial parity. So P_initial = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because when a particle is emitted with orbital angular momentum L, the parity changes by (-1)^L. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct formula.

Wait, the parity of a system when a particle is emitted would involve the parity of the initial system, the parity of the emitted particle, and the orbital angular momentum state. The formula is P_initial = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle. Because when you have orbital angular momentum l, the parity changes by (-1)^l.

So the initial system's parity is for the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L}, since the spin doesn't contribute to parity. So for 1S0, L=0 → parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

So P_initial = +1.

The parity after emission is P_NN * P_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. Because when the particle is emitted, it's going into an orbital state with angular momentum l, which contributes a factor of (-1)^l to the parity.

So, 1 = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^l.

We know that X has intrinsic parity -1. So P_X = -1.

Substituting, 1 = P_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l.

Simplify the right side: (-1) * (-1)^l = (-1)^{l+1}.

So 1 = P_NN * (-1)^{l+1}.

Which implies that P_NN = (-1)^{l+1}.

But P_NN is the parity of the NN system after emission. The parity of the NN system is determined by their orbital angular momentum L_NN. So P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN}.

So putting it together: (-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{l+1}.

Which means, L_NN = l +1 mod 2. Because (-1)^a = (-1)^b → a ≡ b mod 2.

So L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2 → L_NN = l +1 (mod 2).

That's one equation.

Now, for angular momentum conservation: the initial total angular momentum J_initial is 0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN system's angular momentum J_NN and the emitted particle X's angular momentum j. Since J_initial is 0, the total after must also be 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so we have to consider how the orbital angular momenta and spins add up.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the angular momentum coupling. The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state has the NN's J_NN and the emitted X's j. So the sum of J_NN and j must be zero. But since J_NN and j are vectors, their vector sum must be zero. However, considering that they're in a definite state, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of quantum numbers.

Wait, another approach: In the initial state, the NN system is in a state with J=0. After emitting X, the NN system is in a state with some J_NN, and X is emitted with some j. But the total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = 0 = J_NN + j. But angular momentum is a vector, so the possible values of J_NN and j must satisfy that their vector sum is zero. The only way this can happen is if J_NN = j, and they are opposite in direction. But since we are dealing with quantum numbers, perhaps it's more about whether the angular momenta can couple to zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle, l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, L_NN, must satisfy certain conditions along with their spins.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options given and see if I can work through each one.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a final NN state, which is given as a term symbol, plus a particle X, which has a specific letter (like p, s, etc.), which I think denote the orbital angular momentum state of X.

Wait, the emitted particles are denoted by lowercase letters, which I think correspond to their orbital angular momentum. For example, 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.

So for each option, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is known. Let's list them:

A) p → l=1
B) p → l=1
C) f → l=3
D) s → l=0

So for each option, l is known.

Now, let's find L_NN, because we have the condition L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

Because l is known, we can compute L_NN's parity.

But let's also recall that the NN system's term symbol in the final state is something like (2S+1)L J.

Wait, in each option, the final NN state is given as:

A) 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3, L=D=2, J=1.

B) 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1, L=S=0, J=1.

Wait, wait, L is determined by the letter. The letters correspond to L as S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc.

So for option A: 7D1 → S=3 (since 2*3+1=7), L=2, J=1.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1 (2*1+1=3), L=0 (S), J=1.

Option C: 3D3 → S=1, L=2, J=3.

Option D: 3P0 → S=1, L=1 (P), J=0.

Now, from earlier, the condition is L_NN = l +1 mod 2.

So for each option, let's compute l, then compute whether L_NN is l+1 mod 2.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: l=1 (p emission)
So L_NN must be (1 +1) mod 2 → 2 mod 2 = 0.

But the final NN state in option A is 7D1 → L_NN=2.

2 mod 2 is 0. So L_NN=0? But L_NN is 2, which is even, so 2 mod 2=0. So yes, 0. So condition holds.

Wait, the condition is L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

So L_NN = (l +1) mod 2.

For option A: l=1 → (1+1)=2 → mod 2 is 0. L_NN is 2 → 2 mod 2 is 0. So 0 ≡0 → condition holds.

So option A is allowed.

Option B: l=1 (p emission)
So L_NN should be (1+1) mod 2 → 0.

The final state is 3S1 → L_NN=0. 0 mod 2 is 0. So condition holds.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: l=3 (f emission)
L_NN should be (3+1) mod2 →4 mod2=0.

The final state is 3D3 → L=2. 2 mod2=0. So condition holds.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: l=0 (s emission)
L_NN should be (0+1) mod2 →1.

The final state is 3P0 → L=1. 1 mod2=1. So condition holds.

Wait, but hold on. Each of these options satisfies the parity condition, but perhaps not the angular momentum condition.

Wait, but the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps one of the options doesn't satisfy the angular momentum conservation.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the angular momentum conservation. Let's think about the total angular momentum.

The initial state has J_initial = 0.

After emission, the NN system has J_NN, and the emitted particle X has j (which is the total angular momentum of X). So the sum of J_NN and j must be zero, considering direction. So J_NN and j must be equal and opposite.

But since we're dealing with quantum numbers, perhaps the total angular momentum must be zero. So the possible J_NN and j must couple to zero.

Wait, but for a given J_NN and j, their possible total angular momentum can take values |J_NN - j| to J_NN + j in integer steps. So for the sum to be zero, J_NN must equal j, and their spins must be arranged such that their vector sum is zero. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider that the initial J is zero, so the sum of J_NN and j must be zero. This could only happen if J_NN = j and they are opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, this would mean J_NN = j, and the possible coupling is such that their sum can be zero.

Wait, but for two angular momenta j1 and j2, the possible total J can range from |j1-j2| to j1+j2. So if J_initial is zero, then the only way their sum can be zero is if j1 = j2 and they are in a state where their vectors cancel. But in terms of quantum numbers, this isn't straightforward because J must be an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial angular momentum (0) must be equal to the sum of J_NN and j in a way that their vector sum is zero. That would require that J_NN = j, and their orbital angular momenta and spins are arranged such that they cancel each other out. But maybe this is getting too involved.

Let me think of each option and compute whether J_NN and j can sum to zero.

For each option:

- The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l, but what about its spin? Well, the spin of X isn't given, so perhaps we can ignore it, as the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the spin doesn't affect the angular momentum conservation as much as the orbital part, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but each option gives the spin state of the emitted particle. For example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum, and the spin may be part of what's given in the term symbol. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted particle's spin is irrelevant to this part of the problem since the problem is focused on parity and angular momentum, which relate to orbital parts.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) must satisfy the condition we derived earlier (L_NN = l +1 mod 2). But that's about parity. For angular momentum, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system and the emitted particle must add up in some way.

Wait, but the initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial =0. After emission, the NN system has L_NN and the emitted particle has l. The total orbital angular momentum after emission must be zero because the initial state has L_initial =0.

Wait, that's a crucial point. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) plus the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) must sum to zero. But since angular momentum is a vector, their vector sum must be zero. But for quantum numbers, the possible sum can be any integer from |L_NN - l| to L_NN + l. So the only way the sum can be zero is if L_NN = l and they are opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, this isn't possible unless L_NN = l and their sum is zero, but that would require that their possible sum includes zero.

Wait, but L_NN and l are non-negative integers. So their difference can't be negative, but their vector sum can be zero if they're equal and opposite.

Wait, but the problem is in one dimension for this consideration. So perhaps the condition is that L_NN = l. Because if the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L_NN and the emitted particle has l, then their sum in the same direction would be L_NN + l, but if they're opposite, it's L_NN - l. But for the total to be zero, the sum must be zero, which would require that L_NN = l and they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, this is only possible if L_NN = l. Because otherwise, the sum can't be zero.

Wait, but orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum could be anything between |L_NN - l| and L_NN + l. The only way the sum is zero is if L_NN = l and their directions are opposite. But for quantum numbers, this isn't directly applicable because you can't have a negative orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the only way for the total orbital angular momentum to be zero is if L_NN = l, and the state is such that the orbital angular momenta cancel each other out. But that's not possible because orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are non-negative. So perhaps the only way is that L_NN = l, and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is in the opposite direction, but that's not something we can represent with quantum numbers. So maybe the only way for the sum to be zero is if L_NN = l =0. Because only then, the sum is zero.

Wait, that can't be right because for example, in option D, l=0, and L_NN=1. So the sum would be 1, which isn't zero. So that would violate angular momentum conservation. Hence, option D might be the one that's not allowed.

Wait, let me check this.

If the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, then after emission, the sum of the NN system's orbital angular momentum (L_NN) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (l) must be zero. But L_NN and l are non-negative integers, so their sum can only be zero if both are zero. Because if L_NN is any positive integer and l is any positive integer, their sum can't be zero unless both are zero.

Wait, that's a big point. Because orbital angular momentum can't be negative, the only way for the sum to be zero is if both L_NN and l are zero. So any option where L_NN and l are non-zero would violate angular momentum conservation. But let's look at the options again.

Option A: L_NN=2, l=1 → sum is 3 → can't be zero. So this would violate angular momentum conservation.

Option B: L_NN=0, l=1 → sum is 1 → can't be zero. So this is also not allowed.

Option C: L_NN=2, l=3 → sum is 5 → no.

Option D: L_NN=1, l=0 → sum is 1 → no.

Wait, but that would mean none of the options are allowed, which can't be right because the question says one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of the orbital angular momenta must be zero. Because maybe the total angular momentum is the sum, but perhaps the orbital angular momentum isn't the only contributor. Oh wait, the NN system's angular momentum includes both orbital (L_NN) and spin (S_NN), and the emitted particle's angular momentum includes its orbital (l) and spin (s). So the total angular momentum after emission would be the sum of the NN's (L_NN + S_NN) and the emitted particle's (l + s). But the initial state has J_initial=0, which is from the NN system's angular momentum (L=0, S=0) before emission.

Wait, but perhaps the initial state's angular momentum is zero, so after emission, the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must also be zero. So the sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN) and X's angular momentum (j) must be zero. But J_NN = L_NN + S_NN, and j = l + s.

Wait, but angular momentum is a vector quantity. So the possible way for J_NN + j = 0 is that J_NN = -j. But in terms of quantum numbers, this is only possible if J_NN = j, and their directions are opposite. But given that angular momenta are non-negative, the only way is that J_NN = j =0.

Wait, but that would require J_NN =0 and j=0.

But looking at the options, for each final state, J_NN is given. Let's see:

Option A: J_NN =1. So j must be 1. But then the sum can't be zero because 1 +1 can't be zero, unless in a vector sense they cancel. But for quantum numbers, the possible total is |1-1|=0 to 1+1=2. So it's possible to have a state where J_NN and j sum to zero. So J_total =0 is allowed.

Wait, but J_NN is 1, and j is 1 (since X is emitted with l=1, but what about its spin? Well, the spin of X could be part of j. Let's say X has spin s, which contributes to j.

So j = l + s. If the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l and spin s, then j is the total angular momentum, which can vary depending on the coupling of l and s.

Wait, but without knowing the spin of X, it's hard to determine j. But perhaps the problem is simplified by considering only the orbital angular momentum's effect on parity, and not the spin's effect on angular momentum conservation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the spin of X is such that j equals l. But that's an assumption that might not hold.

Wait, but the problem is about which partial wave is not allowed. So perhaps the issue isn't about the spin but about the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, earlier I thought that the sum of L_NN and l must be zero, but that's not correct because the total angular momentum includes spin as well.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use the condition that the total angular momentum after emission must equal the initial (zero). So J_NN + j = 0, but since angular momentum is a vector, this implies that J_NN and j must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So their magnitudes must be equal, and their spins must be arranged so that their vector sum is zero.

But for quantum numbers, the only way their sum can be zero is if J_NN = j and they are in a state where their vectors cancel out. But for individual quantum numbers, this is tricky because you can't have negative values. So perhaps the only way is for J_NN to equal j, but their sum being zero isn't possible unless J_NN and j are zero. But that's only possible if J_NN and j are zero.

But looking at the options:

Option A: J_NN =1 → j must be 1.

So can J_NN =1 and j=1 sum to zero? Because in quantum terms, the possible total J can be from |1-1|=0 to 1+1=2. So yes, J_total can be zero if J_NN and j are both 1 and in opposite directions. But can that happen?

But wait, the initial state has J_initial=0, so the sum after emission must be zero. So if J_NN=1 and j=1, is there a state where their sum is zero? Yes, because 1 and 1 can combine to give a total of 0, 1, or 2. So it's possible.

Similarly, for option D: J_NN=0, j must be 0. So that's allowed.

Wait, for each option, let's see:

Option A: J_NN=1, l=1.

But if X has l=1 and spin s, j could be 1 (if s=0, which is possible for a spin-0 particle, but X is a nucleon, which is spin-1/2. Wait, no, the emitted particle could be a pion, which is spin-0. Or a neutron or proton, which have spin-1/2.

Wait, perhaps X is a meson, but the problem states it's a particle with intrinsic parity -1. Pions have parity -1 and are spin-0. So for X being a pion, j would be l, since s=0. So j=l.

So if X is a pion (spin 0), then j=l.

So for each option, X would have j=l.

So with that in mind, let's reevaluate.

Option A: X is p → l=1 → j=1. J_NN=1. So J_NN + j =1 +1. But J_initial is zero, so the sum must be zero. How can that happen? Well, the sum of two angular momenta can include zero if their vector sum cancels. So in this case, the possible total J is 0, 1, 2. So it's possible to have J_initial=0, so option A is allowed.

Option B: X is p → l=1 → j=1. J_NN=1. So same as above, allowed.

Option C: X is f → l=3 → j=3. J_NN=3. So J_NN=3, j=3. Total possible J is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So J_initial=0 is allowed.

Option D: X is s → l=0 → j=0. J_NN=0. So J_initial=0 is allowed.

Wait, but that would mean all options are allowed. But the question states that one is not permitted. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: use the condition that the final NN state has T=0 and the Pauli condition.

The Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2.

We know T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be odd.

In the final NN state, S is the spin and L is the orbital angular momentum.

So for each option, let's compute S and L and check if S + L is odd.

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 (since 2S+1=7 → S=3), L=2. So S + L=3+2=5 → odd. So condition holds.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1, L=0. 1+0=1 → odd. Condition holds.

Option C: 3D3 → S=1, L=2. 1+2=3 → odd. Condition holds.

Option D: 3P0 → S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → even. So condition does not hold.

Ah! So option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. Because from the problem statement, the Pauli condition must hold, so option D is not allowed.

Wait, that makes sense. So the final state must have S + L =1 mod 2 (since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 → S+L=1 mod2). So option D has S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → even. So 2 mod2 is 0, which doesn't equal 1. So the condition isn't satisfied, making option D not permitted.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a \( ^1S_0 \) state emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \(-1\). The Pauli statistics condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must be satisfied, and the final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \). This implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), meaning \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) must be odd. Additionally, parity and angular momentum conservation must be considered.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The NN system starts in a \( ^1S_0 \) state, where \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting \( X \), the NN system transitions to a new state with \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\). The parity conservation condition is:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^l,
   \]
   where \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of \( X \). Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \) and \( P_X = -1 \), we find:
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^l \implies P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{l+1}.
   \]
   The parity of the NN system is \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \), so:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} = (-1)^{l+1} \implies L_{\text{NN}} \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. Initially, \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \). After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN system's angular momentum \( J_{\text{NN}} \) and the emitted particle's angular momentum \( j \). For the total angular momentum to remain zero, \( J_{\text{NN}} \) and \( j \) must couple to zero.

4. **Pauli Condition**: The condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) simplifies to \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) since \( T(NN) = 0 \). This means \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) must be odd.

### Option Analysis:
Each option specifies the final NN state and the emitted particle \( X \). The orbital angular momentum \( l \) of \( X \) is determined by the emitted particle's lowercase letter (e.g., \( p \to l = 1 \), \( s \to l = 0 \), \( f \to l = 3 \)).

#### Option A: \( ^1S_0 \to ^7D_1 + p \)
- \( X \) has \( l = 1 \).
- Final NN state: \( ^7D_1 \), where \( S = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)) and \( L = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
- Check \( L_{\text{NN}} \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 2 \equiv 1 + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- Check \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- **Allowed**.

#### Option B: \( ^1S_0 \to ^3S_1 + p \)
- \( X \) has \( l = 1 \).
- Final NN state: \( ^3S_1 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L = 0 \) (from \( S \)).
- Check \( L_{\text{NN}} \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 0 \equiv 1 + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies 0 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- Check \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- **Allowed**.

#### Option C: \( ^1S_0 \to ^3D_3 + f \)
- \( X \) has \( l = 3 \).
- Final NN state: \( ^3D_3 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
- Check \( L_{\text{NN}} \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 2 \equiv 3 + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- Check \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- **Allowed**.

#### Option D: \( ^1S_0 \to ^3P_0 + s \)
- \( X \) has \( l = 0 \).
- Final NN state: \( ^3P_0 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L = 1 \) (from \( P \)).
- Check \( L_{\text{NN}} \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 1 \equiv 0 + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which holds.
- Check \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \): \( 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which does not hold.
- **Not allowed**.
