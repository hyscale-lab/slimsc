Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but that's a vector with three elements, so maybe it's a three-dimensional state? Or perhaps it's normalized? Wait, let me check the numbers. Oh, wait, (-1, 2, 1) adds up to... Well, the square of each component: 1 +4 +1 =6. So the vector's length would be sqrt(6). But in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length is 1. So I think the actual state vector is (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6), right? Because 1^2 +2^2 +1^2=6, so sqrt(6) is the normalization factor.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention normalizing the state. Hmm, does that matter? Because when calculating probabilities, the state is assumed to be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities wouldn't sum to 1. So I should probably normalize the state. So the state vector |ψ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T, I think.

Now, the operators P and Q are given as matrices. So for P, the matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, looking at P, I wonder what its eigenvalues are. Because when you measure an observable, you get one of its eigenvalues. So maybe I should find the eigenvalues of P. Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator or something else.

Wait, but for the problem at hand, we are to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, when we first measure P and then Q. Wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after P, so the order is first P, then Q. But wait, no, the question says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So it's one measurement of P giving 0, and then a measurement of Q giving -1. But wait, the problem states, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when you measure them in that order.

Alternatively, perhaps when you measure P, you get 0, and then in the same state (but wait, after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P), but then measuring Q on that new state would give -1. Or maybe the state for Q is in a different eigenstate. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The process is: measure P first. The initial state is |ψ>. When we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So first I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Then, the probability of getting 0 is the sum of the squares of the projections onto the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps P has some symmetries that can help. For example, maybe it's a symmetric matrix. Let me check: The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and (2,1) is same, yes. So it's symmetric, so eigenvalues are real.

But maybe I can find the eigenvalues more easily. Let me think about possible eigenstates.

Wait, perhaps the matrix has a nontrivial structure. Let me see.

Another approach: perhaps P is a projection operator? Let me check if P squared equals P. Let's compute P^2.

Calculating P^2:

First row:

(0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(0) → 1/2 for (1,1).

(0)(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (0)(1/sqrt(2)) → 0 for (1,2).

Hmm, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should compute each element properly.

Let me compute P squared element by element.

P^2[i][j] = sum_{k=1 to 3} P[i][k] * P[k][j]

So (P^2)[1][1] = P[1][1]*P[1][1] + P[1][2]*P[2][1] + P[1][3]*P[3][1}

Which is 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 → 1/2.

Similarly, (P^2)[1][2] = P[1][1]P[1][2} + P[1][2}P[2][2} + P[1][3}P[3][2}.

Which is 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) → 0.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to result in P^2 being equal to P. So P isn't a projection operator. So I might have to find its eigenvalues another way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors. Let's think about possible eigenvectors.

Suppose we have an eigenvector [x, y, z]^T. Then, P acting on it should give λ times the vector.

So, the equations:

0 * x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 * z = λ x → (1/sqrt(2)) y = λ x → eq.1.

(1/sqrt(2)) x + 0 * y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = λ y → (1/sqrt(2))(x + z) = λ y → eq.2.

0 * x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 * z = λ z → (1/sqrt(2)) y = λ z → eq.3.

Hmm. Let me see if I can find a nontrivial solution.

From eq.1 and eq.3: λ x = (1/sqrt(2)) y and (1/sqrt(2)) y = λ z → λ x = λ z → if λ ≠0, then x = z.

If λ=0, then from eq.1 and eq.3: (1/sqrt(2)) y =0 → y=0.

So when λ=0, y=0. Then eq.2 becomes (1/sqrt(2))(x + z) = 0 → x = -z.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where y=0 and x = -z. So, for example, (1,0,-1) is such a vector. Let's check:

P * [1; 0; -1] equals:

First component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So the result is [0;0;0], which is indeed 0 times the vector. So yes, λ=0 is an eigenvalue with eigenvector (1, 0, -1) and any scalar multiples.

So that's one eigenvalue.

Now, what about other eigenvalues? Let's see if there are others.

Assume λ is not zero. Then from eq.1: y = (λ sqrt(2)) x.

From eq.3: z = (λ sqrt(2)) y → substituting y from eq.1: z = (λ sqrt(2)) * (λ sqrt(2)) x = (2 λ^2) x.

So x can be a variable, say x = a. Then y = λ sqrt(2) a, z = 2 λ^2 a.

Now, plug into eq.2:

(1/sqrt(2))(x + z ) = λ y.

Substituting x= a, z=2 λ^2 a, y= λ sqrt(2) a.

So (1/sqrt(2))(a + 2 λ^2 a) ) = λ * (λ sqrt(2) a )

Simplify left side: (1/sqrt(2)) * a (1 + 2 λ^2 ) → [a (1 + 2 λ^2)] / sqrt(2).

Right side: λ^2 sqrt(2) a.

Set equal:

[a (1 + 2 λ^2)] / sqrt(2) = λ^2 sqrt(2) a.

Assuming a ≠ 0 (nontrivial solution), divide both sides by a:

(1 + 2 λ^2)/sqrt(2) = λ^2 sqrt(2).

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

1 + 2 λ^2 = (λ^2 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) → 1 + 2 λ^2 = 2 λ^2.

Wait, that gives 1 = 0, which is impossible. So that suggests that there's no solution when λ ≠0, except for the case where the equation balances. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me re-do the substitution. Let me write the equation again.

(1/sqrt(2))(x + z) = λ y.

x= a, z=2 λ^2 a, y= λ sqrt(2) a.

So LHS: (1/sqrt(2)) ( a + 2 λ^2 a ) = (1/sqrt(2)) a (1 + 2 λ^2).

RHS: λ * (λ sqrt(2) a ) = λ^2 sqrt(2) a.

Set equal:

(1/sqrt(2)) a (1 + 2 λ^2) = λ^2 sqrt(2) a.

Divide both sides by a (assuming a≠0):

(1 + 2 λ^2)/sqrt(2) = λ^2 sqrt(2).

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

1 + 2 λ^2 = 2 λ^2 * (sqrt(2))^2 → sqrt(2)^2 is 2.

So 1 + 2 λ^2 = 2 λ^2 * 2 → 1 + 2 λ^2 =4 λ^2.

Subtract 2λ^2 from both sides: 1 = 2 λ^2 → λ^2 = 1/2 → λ = ± 1/sqrt(2).

Ah, that's better. So the possible λs are ±1/sqrt(2), and λ=0.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1/sqrt(2), and -1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, for each λ, we can find the corresponding eigenvectors.

When λ=0, we saw eigenvector (1,0,-1).

When λ=1/sqrt(2), let's find the eigenvector.

From earlier, x = a, y= (λ sqrt(2)) a → (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) a = a.

z= 2 λ^2 a → 2*(1/2) a= a.

So the vector is (a, a, a). So for a=1, the vector is (1,1,1). Let me check if this is an eigenvector.

Compute P*(1,1,1)^T.

First component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 = 1/sqrt(2).

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 → 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 → 1/sqrt(2).

So the result is (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but for λ=1/sqrt(2), the result should be (1/sqrt(2)) times (1,1,1), which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). But that's not matching the calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, in the calculation above:

P times [1;1;1] gives:

First element: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 +0*1 → 1/sqrt(2).

Second element: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 → 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Third element: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 → 1/sqrt(2).

Hmm, that's (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

But we expected it to be λ*(1,1,1) → (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

So this doesn't match. Hmm, that suggests that maybe my earlier approach has an error. Or perhaps I should re-examine the equations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try again with λ=1/sqrt(2).

From the earlier substitution:

y = (λ sqrt(2)) x → (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) x → (1) x. So y =x.

z = 2 λ^2 x → 2*(1/2) x → x.

So the vector is (x, x, x).

But when I plug into P, I don't get λ times the vector. So perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvectors for λ=1/sqrt(2) and λ=-1/sqrt(2) are not of the form (x, x, x). Maybe I should set up the equations again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenvectors by solving (P - λ I) v =0.

Let's take λ=1/sqrt(2).

So the matrix P - (1/sqrt(2)) I is:

Row 1: 0 - 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 0 → -1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0 -1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) → 1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 -1/sqrt(2) → 0, 1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2).

We can write this augmented matrix and try to find the eigenvectors.

But perhaps it's easier to write the equations:

- (1/sqrt(2)) x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z =0 → -x + y =0 → y=x.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x - (1/sqrt(2)) y + (1/sqrt(2)) z =0 → x - y + z =0 → since y=x, this becomes x -x +z=0 → z=0.

Row3: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y - (1/sqrt(2)) z =0 → y - z =0 → but y=x and z=0, so y=0 → x=0.

Hmm, that's leading to x=0, y=0, z=0, which is trivial. That suggests that maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different method, like using the trace and determinant to find the eigenvalues.

The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 =0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements.

The determinant of P: since P is 3x3, the determinant might be a bit involved. Let me compute it.

|P| = 0*(0*0 - (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(2))) - (1/sqrt(2))*( (1/sqrt(2))*0 - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) + 0*( ... ) → Hmm, perhaps expanding along the first row.

So,

|P| = 0 * minor - (1/sqrt(2)) * minor + 0 * minor.

The minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix:

Rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

Which is:

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, -1/sqrt(2).

So determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 → (-1/2) -0 = -1/2.

So |P| = 0 - (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/2) + 0 → (1/(2 sqrt(2))).

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I miscalculated the signs. Wait, the cofactor expansion for the first row would be:

sum_{j=1 to 3} (-1)^(i+j) * P[i][j] * M_ij.

For the first row, i=1.

So,

term j=1: (-1)^(1+1) * P[1][1] * M11 → (+1)*0 * M11 → 0.

term j=2: (-1)^(1+2)* P[1][2] * M12 → (-1)^3 * (1/sqrt(2)) * M12 → - (1/sqrt(2)) * M12.

M12 is the minor for element (1,2), which is the determinant of the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2.

The submatrix is:

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] → but column 2 is removed, so it's [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

Row3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] → remove column 2 → [0, 0].

Wait, that's not correct. The submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2 is:

Row 2: columns 1 and 3 → [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

Row3: columns 1 and 3 → [0, 0].

So the minor M12 is determinant of:

[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, 0]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)*0) - (1/sqrt(2)*0) )= 0.

So term j=2 is - (1/sqrt(2)) *0=0.

Term j=3: (-1)^(1+3) * P[1][3] * M13 → (+1)*0 * M13 →0.

So overall, determinant of P is 0.

Wait, that's a problem. Earlier, I thought the determinant was 1/(2 sqrt(2)), but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute the determinant another way. Another approach is to compute the determinant by expanding along a different row or column.

Let me try the second row.

P's second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)].

Determinant is sum_{j=1 to 3} (-1)^(2+j) * P[2][j] * M2j.

So,

j=1: (-1)^(3) * (1/sqrt(2)) * M21 → (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) * M21.

M21 is the minor for (2,1), which is the determinant of the submatrix after removing row 2 and column 1.

Submatrix is:

Row1: columns 2 and 3 → [1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row3: columns 2 and 3 → [1/sqrt(2), 0].

So the minor M21 is determinant of:

[1/sqrt(2), 0]
[1/sqrt(2), 0]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)*0) - (0 *1/sqrt(2)) )=0.

So term j=1: (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) *0 = 0.

j=2: (-1)^(2+2) * 0 * M22 → (+1)*0*M22 →0.

j=3: (-1)^(2+3) * (1/sqrt(2)) * M23 → (-1)^5 * (1/sqrt(2)) * M23 → (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) * M23.

M23 is minor for (2,3), which is determinant after removing row 2 and column3.

Submatrix:

Row1: columns 1,2 → [0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row3: columns 1,2 → [0, 1/sqrt(2)].

So determinant is 0*1/sqrt(2) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 →0.

So term j=3 is (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) *0=0.

So overall determinant is 0. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about λ=0 being an eigenvalue, the eigenvector was (1,0,-1), which would suggest that the determinant is zero, because the matrix P is singular. So yes, the determinant is zero, which makes sense because one of the eigenvalues is zero.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, a, and -a, because trace is zero.

So 0 + a + (-a)=0. That makes sense.

So the eigenvalues are 0, a, -a, where a is 1/sqrt(2), because earlier when I thought about the case λ=1/sqrt(2), perhaps that's correct.

So P has eigenvalues 0, 1/sqrt(2), and -1/sqrt(2).

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring P=0, then Q=-1.

Wait, but the first measurement is P, then Q. So the steps are:

1. Measure P on the initial state. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

But wait, how many eigenvectors are there for λ=0? Earlier, we found that the eigenvectors for λ=0 are any vector in the form (a, 0, -a), which is a one-dimensional eigenspace. Because the eigenvalue λ=0 has multiplicity 1, and the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1).

So when measuring P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the inner product between the state |ψ> and the eigenvector of P with λ=0.

So, the state |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector for λ=0 is (1, 0, -1)^T.

So the inner product is ( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ) / sqrt(6) → (-1 +0 -1 ) / sqrt(6) = (-2)/sqrt(6).

The amplitude is (-2)/sqrt(6), so the probability is |amplitude|^2 → (4)/(6) = 2/3.

Wait, but wait, because the eigenvectors are normalized. The vector (1,0,-1) has a length of sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product between |ψ> and this normalized eigenvector is:

( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).

Which is (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)).

Which combines to (-2)/(sqrt(12)) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the probability is |(-1)/sqrt(3)|^2 = 1/3.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So maybe I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector for P=0 is (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

So the inner product is [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ] / [ sqrt(6) * sqrt(2) ) ] → (-1 -1 ) / (sqrt(12)) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0, which is (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we measure Q. The operator Q is given as:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is, what's the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the state is (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

Wait, no. The state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector of P=0, which is (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this new state.

The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors for Q=1 are (1,0,0)^T, for Q=0 are vectors in the y-direction (since the second diagonal element is 0), and for Q=-1 are (0,0,1)^T.

So, the state after P is measured as 0 is (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

Express this state as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of Q.

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is (0,0,1)^T. The coefficient is the inner product between the state and this eigenvector.

So inner product is (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (-1)(1) → -1.

But normalized by 1/sqrt(2). So the amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is |amplitude|^2 → (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but let me double-check.

The state after P measurement is (1, 0, -1)^T / sqrt(2).

Q is diagonal, so the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is e3 = (0,0,1)^T.

The inner product between (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) and e3 is (0 +0 + (-1)(1)) / sqrt(2) → -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

Now, the combined probability of first measuring P=0 (which is 1/3) and then Q=-1 (1/2) would be 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. No, because the measurement of Q is done on the state that's already been projected onto the eigenvector of P=0, which is a specific state. So the probabilities are not independent, they are dependent on the state after the first measurement.

But in this case, the first measurement gives P=0 with probability 1/3, and the state then is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). In this state, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Alternative approach: perhaps the order of measurements is important. But in this problem, the order is P first, then Q. So I think the approach is correct.

So the probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\), which is normalized to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)^T\). The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined to be \( 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is \((1, 0, -1)^T\), normalized as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T\).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between the normalized state \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)^T\) and the normalized eigenvector of \( P \) corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \), \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T\). The inner product is:

\[
\left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) \, \bigg| \, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-1 - 1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
\left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to the eigenvector of \( P \) corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \), normalized as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T\).

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) has eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \((1, 0, 0)^T\), any vector in the \( y \)-direction, and \((0, 0, 1)^T\). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product between the state \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T\) and the eigenvector \((0, 0, 1)^T\):

\[
\left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \, \bigg| \, (0, 0, 1) \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-1) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
\left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
