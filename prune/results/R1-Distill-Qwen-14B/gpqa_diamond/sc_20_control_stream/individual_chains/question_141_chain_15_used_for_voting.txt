Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see if I can break it down.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, but wait—wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, the "2-d" part—oh right, that's 2-dimethylaminoethyl group or something similar? Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, no, the structure would be a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a substituent at position 2. The substituent is probably a methoxy group because OMe is common in such nomenclature. Wait, no, wait—this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or is it 1-bromobenzene-2-d, where 'd' stands for something else? Wait, maybe the substituent is a deuterium. No, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is a nitro group? No, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to parse the name.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d: the 'd' probably indicates a deuterium. So it's a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. So the structure is bromobenzene with a D at the ortho position. So positions are 1 (bromo), 2 (D), and the other positions are hydrogen.

Wait, that makes sense. So the molecule is o-bromobenzenedide? Or is it o-bromobenzened with deuterium at 2? Hmm. Okay, regardless, let's think about the reaction. When a benzene ring has a leaving group like bromine and is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a deprotonating agent and a good base, it's likely to undergo a elimination reaction, perhaps Fittig reaction or some kind of coupling. Alternatively, since NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton leading to elimination.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic contexts. For example, when you have a benzene ring with a bromine and a hydrogen adjacent, the base can abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond—a benzene ring with a double bond between the adjacent carbons (like forming a diene or maybe a cyclohexadiene structure). Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 2, which is adjacent to bromine at position 1, then elimination would occur, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, in benzene, each carbon is sp² hybridized and part of a conjugated ring. So elimination might form a triple bond? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the bromine.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the formation of a benzynes intermediate. Oh! Benzynes are formed when two adjacent leaving groups are present, allowing for elimination of HX twice, forming a triple bond (a diyne) which is aromatic. Wait, but in this case, we have only one bromine and a deuterium. So maybe that's not possible. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which is o-bromobenzenedide. So, benzene ring with Br at C1 and D at C2. Now, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a strong base and a good source of NH2-.

In such a scenario, perhaps the base will abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine. But wait, the substituent at C2 is deuterium, not hydrogen. So if the base tries to abstract a proton, are there any available? Because the adjacent positions to C1 are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so maybe H is present at C6? Or perhaps not.

Wait, benzene is a ring of six carbons. So if C1 is Br, then the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has a D (so perhaps the hydrogen is replaced by deuterium), but wait, no—benzene itself has six CH groups, so if it's 1-bromo-2-d, that would mean a Br at C1 and a D at C2. So the structure would be:

C1: Br, C2: D, and the other carbons (C3, C4, C5, C6) have H.

So the adjacent positions to Br are C2 (D) and C6 (H). So the base (NH2^-) will probably abstract a proton from C6. Once that happens, elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but wait, that would form a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2? Or C1 and C6?

Wait, no. Let me think. If Br is at C1, and H is abstracted from C6, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, in benzene, the numbering is such that the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a ring. So C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. So if the base abstracts a proton from C6, which is adjacent to Br at C1, then the elimination reaction would form a double bond between C1 and C6, leading to a ring with a double bond between C1-C6 and another double bond in the ring elsewhere? Hmm.

Wait, but benzene is already aromatic with three double bonds. If a double bond forms between C1 and C6, that would leave the ring with two other double bonds. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes a cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, that's not possible because C2 has a D. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, but that's not adjacent to Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize this. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the structure is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So the Br is at position 1, D at position 2. The adjacent positions are 2 (D) and 6 (H). So the base (NH2^-) would abstract the H at position 6. That would lead to elimination of Br^- and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would make a triple bond? No, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 if the H is abstracted from C2, but C2 has a D, not H. So the only adjacent H is at C6.

Wait, but wait—could the base abstract a hydrogen from another position? Like, maybe a hydrogen that's meta to the Br? No, because the base abstracts from a position adjacent to the leaving group (Br) to allow E2 elimination. So the H must be on a beta carbon.

In this case, the beta carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so perhaps the H is at C6.

So when the base abstracts H at C6, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene is a ring with delocalized electrons, so forming a double bond between C1 and C6 would lead to adjacent double bonds. But wait, in reality, benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So after elimination, would the ring have four double bonds? That can't be right.

Wait, maybe this elimination doesn't form a new double bond but instead forms a benzynelike structure, but that would require two adjacent leaving groups. Wait, but we've got only one Br and a D.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about other reactions. NaNH2 is a strong base, but in aromatic chemistry, it's also used in dehydrohalogenation to form an aryne. Arynes are formed when two adjacent halogens are present, allowing the elimination of two HX molecules to form a triple bond (a diyne-like structure in the ring, known as a benzene diradical or a benzynelike intermediate).

Wait, but in this case, we have only one Br and a D. So that's not enough for two eliminations. So maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: could the deuterium at C2 affect the reaction in some way? Since deuterium is a heavier isotope, it's less likely to undergo certain reactions, but in this case, perhaps it's a substituent that doesn't influence the base's ability to abstract a proton elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, when aryl halides are treated with a strong base like NaNH2, sometimes they can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires activating groups, like electron-donating substituents, which would facilitate the attack of the nucleophile.

In this case, the substituents are Br (a meta-directing, deactivating group) and D (which is just a substituent but not necessarily activating). So maybe nucleophilic substitution isn't favored here.

Hmm. So back to elimination. If the base abstracts the H from C6, adjacent to Br at C1, then elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the double bond would be between C1 and C6, but what does that look like on the benzene ring?

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me number them:

1 - Br
2 - D
3 - H
4 - H
5 - H
6 - H

If the base takes the H from C6, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, which would give a ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, and perhaps another double bond elsewhere to maintain aromaticity.

Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds. Elimination would lead to a ring with four double bonds, which is impossible. So maybe the ring isn't fully conjugated anymore? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a cyclohexa-1,3-diene structure or something else. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's a triple bond, but that would require two eliminations. But we only have one Br, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, could the base abstract a hydrogen from a position that's not adjacent to Br to form some kind of substituted benzene? But that doesn't seem right because the base would prefer to abstract from a position adjacent to the leaving group for E2 elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the D is a good leaving group? No, deuterium is not a good leaving group. It's a protium isotope, but in this case, it's a substituent, not a leaving group.

Wait, maybe the D is a substituent that doesn't interfere with the reaction. So the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton from C6, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, while the rest of the ring adjusts to maintain conjugation. But how would that look?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a phenyl anion intermediate. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is a benzene ring with a deprotonated position, leading to some kind of diradical or aromatic cation. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. If the base abstracts a proton from C6, elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But in a benzene ring, that would mean the ring now has a double bond between C1 and C6, which are adjacent. But benzene already has three double bonds. So how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexa-1,3-diene. But that's a four-membered ring? No, it's a six-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, the structure would be a ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, for example, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a double bond but instead leads to the loss of H and Br, forming a triple bond? But I thought that requires two adjacent leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. The question is how many possible organic products are formed.

If the reaction leads to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between C1 and C6, then the product would be 1,6-didehydrobenzene (or something similar). But is that possible?

Wait, but in the benzene ring, double bonds are delocalized, so forming a double bond between C1 and C6 would actually result in a structure where the ring has two double bonds, but I'm not sure how that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as an elimination but undergoes some kind of substitution. Wait, but the substituents here are Br and D, and I'm not sure substitution would be feasible.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. But as I thought earlier, that requires two adjacent halogens. Since we have only one Br and D, that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the starting material is not 1-bromo-2-d benzene but something else. Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a methyl group with a deuterium, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a di-substituted benzene where elimination leads to different products depending on where the elimination occurs.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are Br at C1 and D at C2. So when the base abstracts H from C6, elimination leads to a double bond between C1 and C6. But I'm not sure if that's the only possibility. Are there other positions where H could be abstracted?

Wait, perhaps the base could abstract a hydrogen from another position, but that's less likely because the base prefers to abstract from a position adjacent to the leaving group for E2 mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the deuterium at C2 affects the reaction by making that position less acidic or something. But deuterium is slightly less acidic than protium, but in this case, it's a substituent, not a leaving group.

I'm starting to think that the reaction leads to a single product. Because the base can only abstract the H from C6, leading to a single elimination product.

Wait, but wait—the product would be o-benzyne if two adjacent HX groups are eliminated. But since we only have one Br, that's not possible. So perhaps the elimination leads to a single product where a double bond forms between C1 and C6, but that's just one product.

But I'm not entirely confident. How about considering the possibility of the base abstracting a hydrogen from position 3 or 4, which are meta or para to Br? That's less likely, but let's think about it.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br, would that lead to elimination? Probably not, because the E2 mechanism requires the H and leaving group to be anti-periplanar. So the H and Br must be on adjacent carbons for that, so only positions 2 and 6.

But position 2 has a D, so only position 6 is available.

So only one possible elimination product.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the possible structures. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. After elimination, if the base abstracts H from C6, Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But in a benzene ring, that would lead to a structure where the double bonds are between C1-C2 and C3-C4 and C5-C6, but that can't happen because that would create four double bonds in a six-membered ring, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the ring doesn't form a new double bond but instead the bond order changes. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexene.

Wait, maybe the ring opens up? No, that's not likely in this case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Another possibility is that the base isn't abstracting a hydrogen but something else. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so it's likely to abstract a proton.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But for substitution, we usually need a good leaving group and a nucleophile. Here, Br is a good leaving group, but what's the nucleophile? In this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which provides NH3. But NH3 is a weak nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2^- is the nucleophile.

But in an aromatic substitution, the nucleophile would attack an activated ring. Here, the ring is deactivated by the Br (meta-directing), so nucleophilic aromatic substitution might not be feasible without activating groups.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as expected, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation or some coupling reaction, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, another angle: when benzene rings have substituents that can undergo elimination, sometimes they form annulenes. For example, if two substituents are present in adjacent positions, elimination can form a triple bond, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond (a benzyne intermediate). But in this case, we have only one Br and a D. So that's not possible.

Wait, but wait. The molecule has Br at C1 and D at C2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, but wait, C2 has a D, not H. So that's not possible. So the only available H is at C6.

So, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to a ring with a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's a single product, so the number of products would be one.

But wait, the question is about possible organic products. So just one product?

But wait, I'm not so sure. Maybe elimination could lead to different positions due to some kind of ring symmetry.

Wait, but the starting material is o-bromobenzenedide. After elimination, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6. But considering the ring's symmetry, perhaps this is the same as other positions. But I'm not seeing multiple products here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another possible product if the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position. But I don't think that's feasible.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from either C6 or C3, but that would require the base to reach those positions, which are not adjacent to Br. So that's unlikely.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that the reaction produces only one product. But the options include option B (1) and option D (3). So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of two different products based on the regiochemistry of the elimination. But wait, in this case, the regiochemistry is fixed because the only H available is at C6.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces more than one product based on the stereochemistry of the elimination. Wait, but in aromatic rings, stereochemistry isn't a factor in the same way as in alkenes because of the planar structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with two possible double bonds, but I don't see how that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the D at C2 plays a role in the reaction. For example, if H abstraction occurs at C2, but since C2 has a D, that's not possible. So no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the D is a substituent that doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts H from C6, leading to a single product.

So, the number of possible organic products is one. So the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure, like a cyclohexadiene, which could have multiple isomers. But no, in this case, the ring is fixed, and elimination would lead to a single structure.

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is one product. So option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. The reaction proceeds via an elimination mechanism, where the strong base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to the bromine atom, leading to the formation of a double bond.

In this case, the adjacent positions to the bromine are C2 and C6. However, C2 has a deuterium atom (D), not a hydrogen, so the base can only abstract a hydrogen from C6. This results in the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6.

The reaction does not produce multiple products because the base can only abstract a hydrogen from C6, and there are no other viable positions for elimination. The symmetry of the benzene ring does not lead to additional products, and the deuterium at C2 does not interfere with the reaction. Therefore, the reaction yields only one organic product.

Answer: B
