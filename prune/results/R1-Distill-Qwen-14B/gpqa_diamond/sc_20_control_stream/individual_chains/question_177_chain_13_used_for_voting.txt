Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, I remember that mass isn't directly part of the luminosity formula for stars, unless it's about something like the Stefan-Boltzmann law which relates luminosity to radius and temperature. Oh right, because luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. So mass might not factor in here unless it's about some other relation, but maybe it's just extra information.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T is the same, then lambda_max is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosities can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both have the same T, the luminosity would depend on R squared. So let's compute the luminosity ratio.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T^4. And L2 is 4π R2^2 σ T^4. So the ratio L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times higher. So the answer would be option A or D, but wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, but the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light is blueshifted or redshifted. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But the intrinsic peak wavelengths might be different because of the Doppler shift.

So, wait a minute, maybe the temperatures aren't the same. Because the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) approximately, assuming v is much less than the speed of light. But wait, the approximate Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, no, that's a linear approximation. The exact formula is lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but for small velocities, this approximates to 1 + v_r/(c). But wait, if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, leading to redshift, so the observed wavelength is longer.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars' observed lambda_max are the same. So, let's denote:

lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

But lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) )

Hmm, because if a star is moving away, the light is redshifted, so v_r is positive for moving away. Star_1 has v_r = 0, so lambda1_obs = lambda1_emit. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, which I think is moving away, so lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + 700/c) / (1 - 700/c) ) )

Wait, but if Star_1 is at rest, then lambda1_emit is determined by T1, and Star_2's lambda2_emit is determined by T2. But their observed lambda_max are same.

So, if lambda1_emit = lambda2_obs, and lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), then:

lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda1_emit = b / T1, and lambda2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Rearrange:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, because 1/T1 = (1/T2) * something, so T2 = T1 * something.

Wait, let me write it properly.

From 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Suppose Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive. Then the observed lambda for Star_2 is longer than its emitted lambda. So, if both observed lambdas are the same, then Star_1's emitted lambda must be shorter than Star_2's emitted lambda. That would mean T1 is higher than T2, since lambda is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but according to the calculation, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, but if v is positive (moving away), (1 + v/c) is larger than (1 - v/c), so the ratio is larger than 1. So sqrt of that is larger than 1. So T2 = T1 * something > 1 → T2 > T1.

But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away (v>0) is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So for Star_1: lambda1_obs = lambda1_emit (since v=0)

Star_2: lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs,

lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies that lambda1_emit > lambda2_emit, as v is positive, so sqrt(...) is >1.

But lambda is inversely proportional to temperature. So, lambda1_emit = b / T1, lambda2_emit = b / T2.

So, (b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So that's the same as before. So T2 is higher than T1. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, so we see longer wavelengths. But since the observed lambda_max is same as that of Star_1, which is at rest, that means Star_2's emitted lambda must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when you redshift a shorter wavelength, you get the same as the longer wavelength of Star_1. So, for example, if Star_1 emits at 500 nm, Star_2 emits at 400 nm but due to moving away, it's observed at 500 nm. So, lambda1_emit = 500, lambda2_emit = 400. Then, the temperatures: T1 = b / 500, T2 = b / 400. So T2 is higher than T1.

Which aligns with the calculation above. So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, substituting v = 700 km/s. Wait, what's v? It's 700 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 is 0.002333... So v/c is approximately 0.002333.

So, (1 + v/c) = 1.002333, (1 - v/c) = 0.997667.

So the ratio (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667). Let's compute that.

Approximate. Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Hmm, 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047 (since 0.997667 is about 1 - 0.002333, so denominator is roughly 1 - x, numerator is 1 + x. So (1+x)/(1-x) ≈ (1+x)(1+x) )? Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it numerically.

Alternatively, using the approximation that (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + 2x for small x.

Wait, x is v/c = 0.002333, so 2x is 0.004666.

So sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2x) ≈ 1 + x. So √(1 + 2x) ≈ 1 + x, when x is small.

So, sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) ) ≈ 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

Alternatively, to compute more accurately, let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.002333

Denominator: 0.997667

So the ratio is 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ Let's compute that.

Let me compute 1.002333 divided by 0.997667.

Well, 0.997667 is approximately 0.997667.

Compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute this as (1.002333) * (1/0.997667).

1/0.997667 ≈ 1.002333 (since 0.997667 * 1.002333 ≈ 1, because (1 - a)(1 +a) = 1 -a², so a=0.002333, a² is 0.00000544, so 1 - a² is approximately 0.99999456, which is close to 1, but not exact. So more accurately, 1/0.997667 is approximately 1.002334.

So 1.002333 * 1.002334 ≈ (1.002333)^2 ≈ 1.004672.

Wait, but that's (1.002333)^2. But we were taking the square root of (numerator/denominator) = 1.004672. So sqrt(1.004672) ≈ 1.002333.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this confused. Let me think again.

We have:

sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) )

Which is sqrt(1.004672) ≈ 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is about 0.2333% higher than Star_1.

Now, going back to the luminosity.

L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) )

Simplify:

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( T1 / T2 )^4 )

Since T2 = T1 * 1.002333 → T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ approximately 0.99767^2 squared.

0.99767^2 is about (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534.

Then, 0.99534 squared is about (0.99534)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 is about 2.2275. Then, the extra 0.0007 would add about 2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575. So total about 2.229.

Looking at the options: options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Wait, my approximate calculation gives about 2.229, which is approximately 2.23. So that would be option D.

But wait, perhaps I made an approximation error. Let me try to compute more accurately.

First, compute (1 + v/c) = 1 + 700/(3e5) = 1 + 7/(3000) = 1 + 0.0023333...

So (1 + v/c) = 1.002333333...

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666666...

The ratio is 1.002333333 / 0.997666666 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

Compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666666.

We can write this as (1 + 7/(3000)) / (1 - 7/(3000)).

Which is [ (1 + x) / (1 - x) ] where x=7/3000 = 0.0023333.

We can compute this as [1 + 2x + 2x² + ... ] approximately, but perhaps using exact division.

Alternatively, compute 1.002333333333... / 0.997666666666... = let's compute.

Let me compute 1.002333333333 ÷ 0.997666666666.

Let me do the division:

Let me set it up as 1.002333333333 ÷ 0.997666666666.

It's the same as (1002.333333333 / 997.666666666) * 1e-3.

Wait, perhaps easier to compute 1.002333333333 / 0.997666666666.

Let me compute 1.002333333333 ÷ 0.997666666666.

Let me compute 0.997666666666 * 1.0047 = ?

Wait, 0.997666666666 * 1.0047.

Wait, 0.997666666666 * 1 = 0.997666666666

0.997666666666 * 0.0047 = approx 0.004688.

Adding, total is around 1.002355, which is a bit higher than 1.002333. So perhaps 1.002333 / 0.997666666666 is approximately 1.00468.

Wait, maybe using a calculator approach:

Let me compute 1.002333333333 / 0.997666666666.

Let me note that 0.997666666666 is 997666666666e-9.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me compute x = (1 + a)/(1 - a), where a is 0.00233333. Then, x = (1.00233333)/(0.99766666).

So, x = [1 + a]^2 / [1 - a^2], but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, using the Taylor expansion for sqrt((1+x)/(1-x)) when x is small.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to compute the ratio numerically.

Compute 1.002333333333 / 0.997666666666.

Let me write it as (1.002333333333) / (0.997666666666).

Let me compute this as (1 + 0.002333333333) / (1 - 0.002333333333).

So, let me compute numerator and denominator:

numerator = 1.002333333333
denominator = 0.997666666666

Compute numerator / denominator:

Let me compute 1.002333333333 ÷ 0.997666666666.

We can write this as (1 + 0.002333333333) / (1 - 0.002333333333) = [ (1 + a) / (1 - a) ] where a = 0.002333333333.

The exact value of this is (1 + a)/(1 - a) = [ (1 + a) ] * [ 1/(1 - a) ].

We can approximate 1/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + a + a² + a^3 + ... for small a.

So,

(1 + a)/(1 - a) = (1 + a) * (1 + a + a² + a^3 + ...) = 1 + 2a + 2a² + 2a^3 + ... 

For a = 0.002333333333, a² = (0.002333333333)^2 ≈ 5.4444e-6.

So,

(1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + 2a + 2a².

Compute 2a = 2 * 0.002333333333 ≈ 0.004666666666.

2a² = 2 * 5.4444e-6 ≈ 1.08888e-5.

So,

1 + 0.004666666666 + 0.0000108888 ≈ 1.00467755546.

So the ratio (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1.00467755.

Wait, but earlier I thought that sqrt( (1 + a)/(1 - a) ) ≈ 1 + a. Hmm, perhaps I confused the square.

Wait, the problem is, the ratio (1 + a)/(1 - a) is about 1.00467755, and the square root is approximately 1.002338.

Wait, because sqrt(1.00467755) is about 1.002338.

So,

sqrt( (1 + a)/(1 - a) ) ≈ 1.002338.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002338.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002338 ≈ 0.997664.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997664)^4.

Compute 0.997664^2 first.

0.997664^2 = (1 - 0.002336)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.002336) + (0.002336)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004672 + 0.00000545 ≈ 0.99533345.

Then, square that to get the 4th power.

(0.99533345)^2 ≈ let's compute:

= (1 - 0.00466655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466655 + (0.00466655)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093331 + 0.000021777 ≈ approximately 0.990688.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990688.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.990688) = 2.25 * 0.990688 ≈ 2.2276.

So approximately 2.2276.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is close to 2.2276.

So the correct answer should be option D, approximately 2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity \( v_{\text{1}} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and Star_2 has \( v_{\text{2}} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
3. **Observed Peak Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)), implying their intrinsic temperatures are affected by the Doppler effect.

### Step 1: Temperature Ratio
The observed peak wavelength is related to the intrinsic temperature via Wien's law:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)), \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} \).  
For Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \).

Since \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \) is the same for both stars:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature ratio is:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
\]

Substituting \( v/c = 700 / 300{,}000 \approx 0.002333 \):
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4}
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).  
Next, calculate \( (0.99767)^4 \):
\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99533, \quad (0.99533)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The calculated luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.227 \), which is closest to option **D (~2.23)**.

**Answer: D**
