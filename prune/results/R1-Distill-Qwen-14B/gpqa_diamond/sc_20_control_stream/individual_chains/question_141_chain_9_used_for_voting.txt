Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about 1-bromobenzene-2-d being treated with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic compounds. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions here. So the structure given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait—I think that notation might be a typo. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because "d" could stand for "dimethylamino" or something like that. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-diamino benzene? No, that's probably not. Wait, maybe the "d" is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because dimethylamino groups are activating and can undergo elimination reactions.

So, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d where "d" probably stands for a dimethylamino group. So, the structure is bromobenzene with a dimethylamino group at the 2 position. So, the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and (CH3)2NH at position 2.

Now, when NaNH2 is used in condensed ammonia, that's a strong base. In aromatic substitution reactions, strong bases can cause elimination (E2 mechanisms), especially when there's a good leaving group and adjacent hydrogen atoms. Wait, but in aromatic compounds, substitution is more common. Alternatively, in aliphatic systems, dehydrohalogenation would form alkenes. But in aromatic rings, perhaps it's a matter of dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond or a ring expansion? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, aromatic rings with activating groups can undergo elimination. Wait, but 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene has a strong activating group (the dimethylamino group is strongly activating, ortho/para-directing) and a bromine (which is a deactivating, meta-directing group). But wait, the bromine is attached at position 1, and the dimethylamino at position 2. So, the positions are adjacent (positions 1 and 2 are next to each other on the benzene ring).

Wait, maybe the reaction is an elimination reaction. The Br is a good leaving group. So, the base (NH2^- from NaNH2) would abstract a beta hydrogen. In aliphatic systems, this leads to E2 elimination, forming a double bond. But in aromatic systems, can such an elimination occur? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we're dealing with an aromatic substitution where the Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is also used in the formation of benzene rings with more substituted double bonds, like in the synthesis of aromatic rings via elimination. For example, when a benzyl halide is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate to form a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, in this case, the starting material is bromobenzene with another substituent.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the Br leaves, and the dimethylamino group is involved in forming a double bond via elimination. Let me think: the base would deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, and then eliminate Br^-, forming a double bond between the 1 and 2 positions.

But wait, the positions on the benzene ring are 1 and 2. If the Br is at 1 and the dimethylamino at 2, then elimination of H from position 2 (since it's adjacent to Br at 1) would form a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but benzene is already a conjugated system. Forming a double bond between C1 and C2 would actually form a 1,2-dimethylaminobenzene? Hmm, but that's not possible because benzene is cyclic and you can't have a double bond in the ring without affecting the entire structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the reaction is not about elimination within the ring but substituting the Br. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, so nucleophilic aromatic substitution is less likely unless the ring is activated. But the ring has a strong activating group, the dimethylamino group. Oh, wait! The dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, which would make the ring more susceptible to electrophilic substitution. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, not an electrophile. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by a stronger base. Wait, but NaNH2 provides NH2^- as the base. But in aromatic substitution, the NH2^- would have to attack the ring in an electrophilic substitution. But the ring here is activated by the dimethylamino group. So, the Br is in a position that's meta to the activating group. Wait, no, the Br is in position 1, and the dimethylamino is in position 2. So, the activating group is in the ortho position relative to Br.

In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to their ortho and para positions. But here, the Br is a deactivating group, so it would deactivate the ring in its vicinity. But the presence of a strong activating group (dimethylamino) in position 2 might dominate. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I'm not sure if that's feasible here. Nucleophilic substitution typically occurs under strongly activating conditions, like presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups that make the ring susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. But in this case, the dimethylamino group is an activating, electron-donating group. So, perhaps the ring is more activated towards electrophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br^- and the formation of a double bond. So, in this case, the benzene ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and the dimethylamino group would be at C2. But wait, that would create a double bond between C1 and C2, adjacent to the dimethylamino group. But benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds, so adding another double bond would mean breaking the existing ones, which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond? No, that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. So, if the dimethylamino group is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1, perhaps the NH2^- from NaNH2 substitutes the Br. But the ring is activated by the dimethylamino group, making substitution at position 1 more favorable.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But is that possible? I'm not sure. Also, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's more about elimination rather than substitution.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. The base (NH2^-) could abstract a hydrogen from the carbon adjacent to the Br. But in this structure, the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino is at position 2. So, the C1 is where the Br is, and C2 has the dimethylamino group. The adjacent carbons to C1 (where Br is) would be C6 and C2. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either C6 or C2.

Wait, but C2 has a dimethylamino group, which is bulky. So, the hydrogen on C2 might be more acidic because of the activating group. Or maybe the hydrogen on C6 is more accessible. Let's see: when the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, which is adjacent to the C1 (Br), the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's adjacent to the (CH3)2NH group. So, forming a double bond between C1 and C2: but then the ring would have a double bond there, making the structure more like a cyclohexene ring? Hmm, but benzene is a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds, so adding another double bond might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclopentadienyl system or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. If the Br at C1 is eliminated along with a hydrogen from C2, the product would be a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the dimethylamino group at C2. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it a conjugated diene? Or perhaps, the ring would lose one double bond and form a new one. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a result of elimination. So, if the Br is at C1 and the dimethylamino at C2, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, leading to a ring where C1 and C2 are double-bonded, and the rest of the ring has single bonds. But that can't happen because benzene needs to maintain its aromaticity. So, perhaps the ring would lose a hydrogen to form a new double bond, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe this isn't elimination but a substitution. Let me think about the products. If the Br is replaced by something else, but what? The solvent is condensed ammonia, and NaNH2 is providing NH2^- ions. So, perhaps the NH2^- substitutes the Br, leading to 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But that's an amino group adjacent to another amino group, which is possible, but I'm not certain if that's the major product.

Alternatively, maybe multiple products form, such as the substitution product and an elimination product. Let me think: if substitution occurs, you get the amine product. If elimination occurs, you get a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, leading to a different structure. But wait, benzene rings are rigid, so forming a new double bond would require breaking existing ones, which isn't typical. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a nitrile or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ring contraction. For example, when a benzyl halide loses HX, it can form a cyclopentadienyl ring. But in this case, the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Losing HBr would form a ring with five members? Wait, that would mean losing a carbon, which isn't the case here because the benzene is six-membered. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up different reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is aniline derivative. If the Br is replaced by NH2, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But that's a crowded structure, but possible. Alternatively, maybe the dimethylamino group is in the para position. Wait, no, the starting material has Br at 1 and dimethylamino at 2, which are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. But that's not common; aromatic rings usually don't form triple bonds under these conditions.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about similar reactions I've heard of. For example, when toluene is treated with a strong base, it can form phenyl rings with double bonds, but that doesn't apply here. Alternatively, the formation of aniline from bromobenzene using NH3 and a base. Wait, but that's more of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But would that substitution happen under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps more than one product is formed. Let's think about possible products.

If elimination occurs, perhaps forming a ring with a double bond. But in that case, would the ring remain aromatic? For benzene to stay aromatic, it must have six pi electrons and a planar structure. Forming a double bond in place of a single bond (elimination) would disrupt the ring's conjugation. So, maybe the ring isn't aromatic anymore, but that's a possibility.

Wait, but another thought: in the case of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a leaving group and an adjacent activating group, the elimination could form a ring with one fewer substituent, effectively expanding or contracting the ring. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. But I don't think so because the conditions are basic, not reductive or oxidative.

Wait, maybe the Br is in the meta position relative to the dimethylamino group. Oh, no, the Br is at position 1 and the dimethylamino at 2. So, they are adjacent, which is ortho.

Back to the reaction conditions: NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. This is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation in aliphatic systems, leading to alkenes. So, perhaps the same applies here. So, the Br is a good leaving group, and the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond.

But in the aromatic ring, eliminating H from the adjacent carbon would form a double bond, making the ring non-aromatic, but perhaps it's a conjugated diene. Wait, but the benzene ring is already a conjugated system. Adding another double bond wouldn't make sense because you can't have two adjacent double bonds in a six-membered ring without it being antiaromatic, which is not favorable.

Hmm, maybe the elimination doesn't happen within the ring but elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group. Let me think: if the Br is replaced by an amino group (NH2), then the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But that's a possibility.

Wait, but the starting material has a dimethylamino group and a bromine on adjacent positions. If the substitution occurs, the product would have two amino groups: the original dimethylamino (converted to amino?) No, wait, the substituents are different. Let me clarify: the starting material is 1-bromo (so Br) and 2-dimethylamino (N(CH3)2). If the Br is substituted by NH2 from NaNH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But substituting Br (a deactivating group) with NH2 (a strong activating group) would make the ring more activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the dimethylamino group, leading to deprotonation and some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a nitrile or another group, but I don't see how that would happen with NaNH2.

I'm a bit confused, so maybe I should think about the possible products. If substitution occurs, only one product would form because the Br is in a specific position. If elimination occurs, perhaps multiple products form based on where the hydrogen is abstracted.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino is at position 2. So, the possible adjacent positions (for elimination) are position 2 and position 6. So, when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 (which is already substituted with dimethylamino) or position 6, which is adjacent to position 1.

Wait, but position 2 has the dimethylamino group; maybe the hydrogen there is more acidic. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, elimination of Br would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But if the base abstracts from position 6, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but in benzene, position 1 is adjacent to positions 2 and 6.

So, if the base abstracts from position 6, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But since the ring is already conjugated, forming a new double bond might not be possible without disrupting the aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps both positions 2 and 6 are possible sites for hydrogen abstraction, leading to different products. But position 2 is already substituted with a bulky group, so maybe only position 6 is available. So, eliminating from position 6 would form a double bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, in benzene, all the carbons are equivalent in a certain sense, but the substituents direct where the reaction occurs. Since the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But in this case, the reaction is elimination, not substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to different products. Let me think: if the hydrogen is abstracted from position 6, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, leaving the ring with two substituents: the dimethylamino at C2 and the new double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but that would leave the ring with a double bond, but benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. So, perhaps the formation of another double bond would cause the ring to lose aromaticity. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, maybe the elimination isn't possible in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amino group. Then, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But would that be the only product? Or could there be other products, such as if the substitution occurs at a different position?

Wait, but the Br is at position 1, so substitution would occur there. So, only one product from substitution.

Wait, but what about the possibility of more than one product from substitution? For example, if the substitution could happen in more than one position. But in this case, the Br is fixed at position 1, so substitution there would lead to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base could cause some rearrangement leading to different isomers. But I'm not sure about that.

So, putting this all together: if the reaction leads to substitution at position 1 (Br replaced by NH2), then only one product forms. If elimination occurs, perhaps only one product forms because the possible sites for elimination are limited. Or, maybe elimination isn't possible, leading to only substitution.

Wait, but what if there are multiple sites for elimination? For example, if the Br is at position 1 and the dimethylamino at position 2, the hydrogen could be abstracted from either position 2 or position 6, leading to different double bonds. Or perhaps, both positions are possible, leading to two different products.

So, if the Br is at position 1, and the hydrogen is abstracted from position 2, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. If abstracted from position 6, it would form a double bond between 1 and 6. Would these be different products?

Wait, in benzene, positions are relative. So, forming a double bond between 1 and 2 would be the same as between 1 and 6 when considering the cyclic structure. Or would they be different because the substituents are in different positions?

Wait, let's number the ring. Let's imagine the ring with the Br at position 1. The positions are numbered as follows: 1 (Br), 2 (dimethylamino), 3, 4, 5, 6. So, if elimination occurs at position 2, the double bond is between 1 and 2. If elimination occurs at position 6, the double bond is between 1 and 6. But in a benzene ring, the positions are cyclic, so the double bonds between 1-2 and 1-6 are actually adjacent in the ring. Wait, no. If the ring is arranged such that positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are in order, then position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So, elimination at position 6 would form a double bond between 1 and 6, and elimination at position 2 would form a double bond between 1 and 2.

But in the case where the double bond is between 1 and 2, the ring would have a substituent (dimethylamino) at position 2, which is now part of the double bond. So, the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and the dimethylamino would be attached to C2, which is part of the double bond. That might lead to a different structure than if the double bond is between 1 and 6.

Wait, but the ring is symmetric, so perhaps these two elimination products are actually the same. Because if you rotate the ring, the double bond between 1-2 and the dimethylamino at 2 would look the same as the double bond between 1-6 and the dimethylamino at 6. Wait, no, because in the starting material, the dimethylamino is at position 2, not 6. So, elimination from position 6 would result in a double bond between 1 and 6, and the dimethylamino would remain at position 2. But wait, that's not possible because the dimethylamino is at position 2, so the elimination from position 6 would form a double bond between 1 and 6, leaving the ring with a double bond there and the dimethylamino at position 2. That's a different structure than elimination from position 2.

Wait, but the starting material has the dimethylamino at position 2, so if elimination occurs from position 6, the double bond would be between 1 and 6. But then the ring would have the dimethylamino at position 2 and a double bond between 1 and 6. Are these two products different?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's structure allows for the same product regardless of which position the hydrogen is abstracted from. But I'm not sure. If the dimethylamino group is at position 2, and the double bond is between 1 and 2, that's a different structure than if the double bond is between 1 and 6, with the dimethylamino at 2.

Wait, but in benzene, the positions are relative. So, perhaps the two products are actually the same because the ring can be rotated. No, because the substituents are in different positions. For example, if the ring has a double bond between 1 and 2, and the dimethylamino is at 2, then that's a specific structure. If the double bond is between 1 and 6, and the dimethylamino is at 2, that's a different structure because the substituents are in different positions relative to the double bond.

Wait, but the ring is symmetric, so perhaps when you rotate the ring, the two products are actually the same. Hmm, maybe not. Because the substituents are in different positions.

So, if elimination occurs from position 2, the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2 and the dimethylamino at 2. But that would make the double bond between 1 and 2, and the substituent on C2. Alternatively, if elimination occurs from position 6, the double bond is between 1 and 6, and the substituent is at position 2, which is across from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ring can rotate, so those two products are actually the same. For example, if you have a double bond between 1 and 2 and the substituent at 2, then rotating the ring 120 degrees would place the substituent at a different position, but because the ring is symmetric, maybe they are considered the same.

Wait, no, because the substituents are in fixed positions relative to each other. So, elimination from position 2 would lead to a different structure than elimination from position 6.

Therefore, if elimination is possible from both positions 2 and 6, two products would form. But wait, the dimethylamino group is at position 2. When the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, it's adjacent to the dimethylamino group. That might make the hydrogen more acidic, so elimination from position 2 is more favorable. Alternatively, maybe position 6 is more accessible for the base to abstract the hydrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination can occur at both positions, leading to two different products. So, the number of possible products would be two: one from elimination at position 2 and another from elimination at position 6.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino is at position 2. So, the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. So, the possible beta hydrogens are from positions 2 and 6.

If the base abstracts the hydrogen from position 2, elimination of Br would form a double bond between 1 and 2. The substituents would be the dimethylamino at 2 (now part of the double bond) and the rest of the ring.

Wait, but if the dimethylamino is at position 2, and the double bond is between 1 and 2, that would make the substituent part of the double bond. But I'm not sure how that would affect the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would lose the Br and form a double bond, making a five-membered ring or something else, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination from position 6 would form a double bond between 1 and 6, leaving the dimethylamino at position 2.

So, in this case, two different products could form from elimination at positions 2 and 6. Thus, the reaction would produce two products: one with a double bond between 1-2 and another between 1-6.

Wait, but would those two products be distinct? Or are they the same due to the symmetry of the benzene ring? Hmm, I think they're different because the substituents are in different positions relative to the double bond.

So, if elimination can occur from both positions, leading to two different products, then the number of products would be two. Additionally, if substitution occurs, another product would form. But earlier, I thought substitution might only occur once, leading to one product.

Wait, but substitution would require the NH2^- to attack the position where Br is. So, substitution would lead to only one product: 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

If elimination leads to two products, and substitution leads to one, then the total products would be three. But wait, wait, the question states that the starting material is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What's the solvent's role? Well, ammonia is a good solvent for such reactions, often used in dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but if substitution is possible, and elimination is possible, how many products would form? Let me count:

1. Substitution product: 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene (assuming Br is replaced by NH2).

2. Elimination product from position 2: double bond between 1-2, but since the dimethylamino is at 2, that might lead to a structure where the substituent is part of the double bond. Is that possible? Or perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond at a different position. Alternatively, perhaps elimination isn't possible, and only substitution occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't possible, and only substitution occurs. If substitution is the main pathway, then only one product forms.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what's more likely: substitution or elimination under these conditions.

In aromatic substitution, NaNH2 is a strong base but not typically a nucleophile. However, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack. But the dimethylamino group is an activating group, so perhaps the ring is activated for nucleophilic substitution. But usually, nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings occurs when the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, which deactivate the ring towards electrophilic substitution but activate it towards nucleophilic substitution. In this case, the ring has a strong activating group (dimethylamino) and a deactivating group (Br), but the activating group is ortho/para-directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group. But I'm not certain about the conditions favoring that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to a ring with a double bond. But as I'm not entirely sure about the feasibility of that, I'm a bit stuck.

If the reaction produces two elimination products and one substitution product, that would be three products. But the options don't have three as the correct answer for this question, but let me check the options again. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Wait, perhaps substitution is not feasible, and only elimination occurs, leading to two products. So, the answer would be C)2.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination isn't possible, and only substitution occurs, leading to one product. So, the answer would be B)1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: looking for similar reactions. I recall that when a bromobenzene derivative has an adjacent strong activating group, like a strong electron-donating group, elimination can occur to form a ring with a double bond. For example, a benzyl bromide with a strong activating group adjacent can eliminate to form a trans-alkene. Wait, but that's in aliphatic systems. In aromatic systems, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: when benzene rings have two substituents that are adjacent, elimination can lead to the loss of a leaving group and a hydrogen, forming a double bond. For example, 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene can eliminate HBr to form 1,2-dimethylbenzene (but that's not possible because benzene is fully conjugated). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a phenol derivative. But that doesn't seem relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. So, the product would be 1,2-dimethylaminobenzen, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not confident in my reasoning here. Another angle: the reaction could form a meta director. Wait, but I'm not sure how that applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with two double bonds, but that's not possible because benzene is already a fully conjugated ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the conditions.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess. The reaction is treating 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene with NaNH2 in NH3. The likely reaction is elimination, leading to a ring with a double bond. Since the Br is at position 1 and the dimethylamino at 2, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either position 2 or 6. So, two possible elimination products. Alternatively, substitution could occur, leading to one product.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to only one product because the starting material is symmetric, but in this case, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, which aren't symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because the base can abstract a hydrogen from only one position due to steric hindrance from the dimethylamino group. For example, the hydrogen at position 6 might be more accessible than the one at position 2, which is adjacent to the bulky dimethylamino group. So, only elimination from position 6 occurs, leading to one product.

If that's the case, then only one product from elimination. But earlier, I thought substitution might lead to another product, but I'm not sure if substitution occurs under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution isn't feasible, and only elimination occurs, leading to one product.

Wait, but the question asks how many possible organic products are there. So, if elimination leads to one product, the answer would be B)1. If elimination leads to two products, the answer would be C)2. If substitution is possible along with elimination, leading to three products, then D)3.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think that under these conditions, elimination is more likely than substitution. So, if elimination occurs from both possible positions, leading to two products, then the answer would be C)2.

But I'm still a bit confused. Another angle: if the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond. So, perhaps the reaction forms a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and another possible product with a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, in the starting material, the dimethylamino is at C2, so the double bond between C1 and C6 would leave the dimethylamino at C2, which is next to the double bond, but I'm not sure if that's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single product because the ring's symmetry makes the two elimination products identical. But in this case, the substituents are at different positions, so the products would be different.

Hmm, I think I've thought this through as much as I can. I'll go with the idea that elimination can occur from two different positions, leading to two products. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is two.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (where "d" likely represents a dimethylamino group) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2 on the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substitution Reaction**:  
   NaNH₂ could theoretically substitute the bromine atom with an amino group (NH₂). This would yield 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. However, substitution is less likely under these conditions because NaNH₂ is more commonly associated with elimination rather than nucleophilic substitution.

2. **Elimination Reaction**:  
   The strong base NaNH₂ can abstract a β-hydrogen adjacent to the bromine atom, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. The possible β-hydrogens are located at positions 2 and 6 relative to the bromine at position 1.  
   - If the hydrogen is abstracted from position 2, a double bond forms between positions 1 and 2, resulting in a product with the dimethylamino group at position 2.  
   - If the hydrogen is abstracted from position 6, a double bond forms between positions 1 and 6, leaving the dimethylamino group at position 2.  

   These two elimination products are distinct because the relative positions of the substituents differ.

3. **Symmetry Considerations**:  
   While benzene rings are symmetric, the specific substituents (bromine at position 1 and dimethylamino at position 2) break the symmetry. Therefore, the two elimination products (double bonds at 1-2 and 1-6) are structurally distinct.

4. **Feasibility of Products**:  
   Substitution is less likely due to the strong base favoring elimination. Thus, the primary products are the two elimination products.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces two distinct organic products from elimination. Substitution is unlikely under these conditions, and the two elimination products are structurally different due to the asymmetry introduced by the substituents.
