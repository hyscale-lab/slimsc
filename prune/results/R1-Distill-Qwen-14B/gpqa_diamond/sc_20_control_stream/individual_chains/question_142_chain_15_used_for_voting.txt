Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). They're asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space and give me four options for the coordinates r. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

Wait, so ρ is a density matrix. I think the first thing I should do is figure out what the state looks like. The form given is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Oh right, because for a density matrix, the trace should be 1. Let me check: each term |0><0| and |1><1| has trace 1, so adding them gives 2, multiplied by 1/2 gives trace 1. That makes sense.

Now, I'm trying to recall how a density matrix represents a state. If the density matrix is a pure state, it can be written as |ψ><ψ|. But here, ρ doesn't look like that. Let me see: if ρ were |+><+|, where |+> is (|0> + |1>)/√2, then ρ would be (|0> + |1>)(<0| + <1|)/2. Expanding that gives (|0><0| + |0><1| + |1><0| + |1><1|)/2. But the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, so that's different. That means there are no off-diagonal terms. So ρ doesn't have the coherences, which suggests it's a mixed state.

Wait, so what's the state in this case? The density matrix (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 is actually a mixed state of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So each basis state has a probability of 1/2. So the state is a completely mixed state in the computational basis.

Now, I'm trying to remember about the representation of density matrices in terms of Bloch vectors or qubit space. Oh right, for a single qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So, let's write ρ in that form. The general form is:
ρ = (I/2) + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (r_x, r_y, r_z). Each σ is a Pauli matrix: σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Let me compute that. So, our given ρ is:
ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

I know that |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ is I/2, which is the maximally mixed state. How does that translate to the Bloch vector?

Let me expand (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is 2x2, so (I + ... )/2 would be [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ].

But in our case, ρ is I/2. So that matrix is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Comparing, the off-diagonal terms of ρ are zero. So for the general form, the off-diagonal terms (r_x - i r_y)/2 must be zero. Which implies that both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if (r_x - i r_y) is zero, then r_x = 0 and r_y = 0, since they're real numbers.

What about the diagonal terms? The (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. So (1 + r_z) = 1 → r_z =0. Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result, r_z=0.

So putting it all together, r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. The Bloch vector is (0,0,0). 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer.

Wait, but why is the Bloch vector at the origin? Because the density matrix is completely mixed, meaning there's no preferred direction. The maximally mixed state is the center of the Bloch sphere, which is represented by r=0. So yeah, C is the right choice.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). Additionally, the diagonal terms confirm that \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

The maximally mixed state is represented by the origin because it has no preferred direction in the Bloch sphere and is equally mixed across all possible states. Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
