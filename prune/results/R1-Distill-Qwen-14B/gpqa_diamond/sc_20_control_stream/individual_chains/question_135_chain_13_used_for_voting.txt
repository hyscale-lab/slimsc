Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So that would imply that the boson X couples to fermions with some coupling strength λ. 

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to find out which fermions X can decay into at the lowest order. At the lowest order, I think that means tree-level decays, so X decays into a pair of fermions. Each decay must satisfy energy conservation and the fermions must have a mass less than half of X's mass because each gets some energy but their rest mass must be accounted for. 

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay into two particles, each must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Wait, but for fermions, their rest mass must be less than or equal to half of X's mass because each gets at least their rest mass. So let me list the known fermion masses. 

Let me think about the masses of the quarks and leptons. 

Leptons: electrons are about 0.511 MeV, negligible. Muons are ~105.7 MeV, tau is ~1.78 GeV. 

Quarks: up and down are light, like a few MeV each. The strange quark is around 100 MeV, maybe 95-105 MeV. Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, bottom quark is around 4.5-5 GeV. Top quark is way too heavy, about 173 GeV.

So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f̄, the mass of f must be less than 3 GeV. So which fermions have masses below 3 GeV?

Tau is 1.78 GeV, which is below 3. So tau can be a decay product. The muon is 0.1 GeV, so that's way below. Same with electrons. 

Looking at quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Up and down are like 2-5 MeV, so much below. Strange is like 100 MeV, also under 3 GeV. Charm is around 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. But wait, bottom is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3, so X can't decay into b quarks because each b would need 4.5 GeV, but X only has 6 GeV. So each b would require 4.5 GeV, so 6 >= 2*4.5? That would be 9 GeV. No, that's impossible. So b quarks are out.

Wait, wait but let me think. The threshold for decay is when the fermion mass is exactly half of X's mass. Because when the fermions are at rest, their combined mass would be 2m_f. So 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X / 2. So 6 GeV /2 is 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be produced.

So, let's list all the possible fermions with mass ≤3 GeV:

- Leptons: e⁻, e⁺ are almost massless. So yes. Mu+ and mu- are about 0.1 GeV, so yes. Tau+ and tau- are about 1.78 GeV, so yes.

- Quarks: up, down, strange, charm.

Wait, but what about their antiquarks? Well, the pair is f and f_bar, so any fermion can be produced as a pair as long as each has mass m_f ≤3 GeV.

Now, the options are:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, the b quark is ~4.5 GeV. So m_f is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c quark is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So that's allowed. So this option includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But what about the other possibilities?

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

No, because t quark is about 173 GeV, way over. So X can't decay into top quarks. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, same problem as option A. B is too heavy.

So the correct options would include all fermions with m_f <=3 GeV. So that includes u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but wait, what about charged leptons vs neutral? The interaction term is given as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, wait, maybe I need to look at the structure of the coupling. Wait, the term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Is that correct? Or perhaps the term is more like ψ_f (y) (ῡ + X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa-like, which would imply that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So for each fermion, the coupling is proportional to λ f, where f is the fermion type.

Wait, but regardless, the key point is which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV. So the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

- e+ e-

- mu+ mu-

- tau+ tau-

- u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Because their masses are under 3 GeV.

So looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option A includes b, which is incorrect.

Option C includes t, which is incorrect.

Option D includes b, which is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, in option B, the decay includes c c̄. So the X can decay into charm quark pairs. But what is the mass of the charm quark? Approximately 1.5 GeV, so 2*m_c is 3 GeV. So that's allowed. So yes, c c̄ is allowed.

So the correct answer should include all the fermions with mass under 3 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

So that's all allowed.

Wait, but why is there no option that includes all the possible quarks (u, d, s, c) and all the charged leptons (e, mu, tau)? Let me check the options again.

Option B has exactly that, except it doesn't include the top quark, which is impossible. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but option B also includes c c̄. So that's allowed. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but what about the top quark? It's mass is way higher, so that's not possible. So options C and A have top and bottom, which are excluded. So only option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV at the lowest order. The interaction term given in the Lagrangian implies that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses:
- **Leptons**: 
  - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
  - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
  - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Quarks**:
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 3-7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95-105 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
  - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \). All these fermions have \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
