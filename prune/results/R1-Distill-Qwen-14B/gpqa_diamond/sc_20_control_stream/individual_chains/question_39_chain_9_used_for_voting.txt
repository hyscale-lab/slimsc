Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on wave functions, but I'll try to work it out.

The problem says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, no. The wave function given is probably just a part of the actual solution. Because for the region where the particle is found (x between 1 and 3), the wave function exists. But outside, like x<1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero. But according to the problem statement, when measurements are made, none are found beyond x=1 and x=3, which suggests that the wave function is zero outside that range.

Wait, but looking at the given wave function: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Because wave functions usually are complex, but the real and imaginary parts need to satisfy certain conditions, right? Oh wait, the wave function might be written as a sum of real and imaginary parts. But perhaps the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5i), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But wait, that's strange because the imaginary part should depend on x, shouldn't it? Because if it's a constant imaginary part, that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the entire expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but the way it's written is ambiguous. The original question says: ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where i is the square root of -1. So it's a subtraction: a/(sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that seems odd because the imaginary part doesn't depend on x. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as a sum, but maybe I'm supposed to consider modulus squared of the wave function for probability density.

Wait, but the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the square of the modulus |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the particle is confined between 1 and 3, and the wave function is zero outside.

So, the first step is to find the normalization constant 'a' so that the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

The wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the modulus squared of a complex number (a + ib), it's a² + b². So here, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5, so the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The modulus squared is |ψ|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (-0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Is the wave function correctly given? The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2/(1+x)) + 0.25. That's correct.

Wait, another thing: the problem says that in the region where the particles can exist (x between 1 and 3), the wave function is given as that expression. But outside, the wave function is zero. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. So the integral for normalization is only from 1 to 3. So that's correct.

So the steps are:

1. Compute |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

2. Integrate from x=1 to x=3: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

3. Solve for a: a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849.

Which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is confined to the region \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this interval. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. The integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \) from \( 1 \) to \( 3 \) is:
   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. The integral of \( 0.25 \) from \( 1 \) to \( 3 \) is:
   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.
