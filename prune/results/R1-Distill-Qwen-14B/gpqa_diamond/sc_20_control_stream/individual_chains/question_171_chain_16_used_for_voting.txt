Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in substitution reactions for six different benzene derivatives. Each of these substances reacts with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the lowest para yield comes first, and the highest comes last.

Let me list the compounds again for clarity:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxyethylbenzene? Wait, no. Benzene with a COOEt group. So it's phenyl acetate? Or maybe ethyl benzoate. Oh right, it's ethyl benzoate: benzene with a COOEt substituent.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, the substituents are:

1) methyl
2) COOEt (ester)
3) Cl
4) NO2
5) ethyl
6) COOH

The reaction is an electrophilic substitution with bromine in excess. So, it's a bromination reaction. Since it's an electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of the substituents matter.

In electrophilic substitution, activating groups direct the incoming electrophile (here, Br2) to certain positions. Activating groups are electron-donating and direct ortho/para. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing, so they can be meta directors or para/ortho but deactivating.

Wait, but not all deactivating groups are meta directors. For instance, nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta directing. Whereas some groups like carbonyl (like in benzaldehyde) are deactivating and ortho/para directing because of resonance, but I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the directing effects of each substituent here.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects.

1) Methyl (CH3-): activating, ortho/para directing. Because methyl is an activating group (electron donating via inductive effect), so the incoming electrophile attacks ortho, para, and meta positions, but mainly ortho and para. Wait, no, activating groups are ortho/para directors because they are electron-donating, so they direct to ortho and para positions, making those more reactive.

2) COOEt (ester group): the ester is a deactivating group. Wait, the COOEt group is an electron-withdrawing group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So, the substituent is meta directing. Because ester groups are meta directors. Wait, wait, no. Actually, esters are deactivating but ortho/para directors. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with other substituents.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's clarify. The substituents can be classified based on their electron-donating or withdrawing nature. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3 are activating and ortho/para directors. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR (ester) are deactivating and meta directors. Wait, but wait. Some groups like -COOR (ester) have resonance structures that can pull electrons through resonance, making them deactivating and meta directors. So, for example, the ester group is deactivating and meta-directing. Or is it ortho/para? Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on this.

Wait, I remember that substituents like -COOH (carboxylic acid) are deactivating and meta-directing. Similarly, -COOR (ester) is also deactivating and meta-directing. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: groups that are strong deactivating (like nitro) are meta directors; groups that are weaker deactivating (like carbonyl) might be ortho/para directors if they can still donate electrons through resonance. Wait, no, I think the ester group is a meta director. Because the carbonyl oxygen is more electronegative, so it withdraws electrons via resonance, making the ring less reactive, and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So, the substituents:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para
2) COOEt: deactivating, meta
3) Cl: deactivating, ortho/para. Wait, Cl is a bit tricky. Cl is electronegative, so it's a deactivating group. But it's also an ortho/para director because it can donate electrons via resonance (though it's weakly deactivating). So, Cl is ortho/para, but deactivating.
Wait, so Cl is a meta director? No, I think Cl is ortho/para director. Because when Cl is attached to benzene, the lone pairs on Cl can donate into the ring via resonance, which activates the ortho and para positions, making them more reactive. But overall, Cl is a deactivating group because the inductive effect (withdrawing electrons) is stronger than the resonance donating. So, it's a deactivating, ortho/para director.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about Cl. Some sources say Cl is ortho/para director, but deactivating. So it's a meta director? No, no, no, wait. No, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So, for example, chlorobenzene undergoes substitution more slowly than benzene, but the substitution occurs at ortho and para positions.

So, in the case of Cl, the substituent is deactivating (so reactions are slower) but directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Similarly, NO2 is a strong deactivating group and is a meta director. Because nitro groups are strong EWGs, they deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

Now, for the substituents:

1) CH3: activating, o/p
2) COOEt: deactivating, meta
3) Cl: deactivating, o/p
4) NO2: deactivating, meta
5) C2H5 (ethyl group): activating, o/p
6) COOH: deactivating, meta

Wait, let me make sure about each:

- CH3 (methyl): activating, directs o/p
- COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta
- Cl: deactivating, o/p
- NO2: deactivating, meta
- C2H5 (ethyl): activating, o/p
- COOH (carboxylic acid): deactivating, meta

Wait, but wait. I've heard that -COOH is a meta director. Same as -COOR (ester). So, for substituents 2 (COOEt) and 6 (COOH), both are deactivating and meta directors.

So, the substituents in each compound are:

1) CH3: activating, o/p
2) COOEt: deactivating, meta
3) Cl: deactivating, o/p
4) NO2: deactivating, meta
5) C2H5: activating, o/p
6) COOH: deactivating, meta

Now, when you have an activating group, the ring is more reactive, and the incoming electrophile has more positions to attack. For activating groups, the o/p positions are favored. For deactivating groups, if they are meta directors, the meta positions are favored.

Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer's yield. So, the percentage of the para-substituted product.

In substituents that are o/p directors, the para is one of the possible positions. For meta directors, the para position isn't a major product.

So, let's think about each substituent's ability to produce the para isomer.

1) CH3: o/p director, so para is a major product. Since it's activating, the ring is more reactive, so the reaction goes faster, but the position is o/p. So, for toluene, the para isomer would be a significant fraction, but so is the ortho. But wait, in substitution reactions, when a substituent is o/p directing, the major products are para and ortho. But in cases where steric hindrance is a factor, the para might be more favored than ortho.

Wait, but when you have a substituent that's o/p, like CH3, the major products are ortho and para. But for an activating group, steric factors can influence the major product. For example, in toluene, the para product is more favored than ortho because the methyl group is in the ortho position, which is more crowded.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, in some cases, the para isomer is the major product, and ortho is a minor product because of steric hindrance.

Wait, for toluene (methylbenzene), the bromination with Br2 in presence of FeBr3 as catalyst. Methyl is activating, o/p director. The major product is para-bromotoluene, and some ortho, but para is more because ortho is more hindered. So, the para isomer's weight fraction is higher than the ortho.

For substituents that are meta directors, like COOEt, NO2, COOH, the para is not a major product. Instead, the meta is the major product, so the para isomer's yield would be low.

Wait, but that's not quite right. Wait, for substituents that are meta directors, the incoming electrophile attacks the meta position. So, in that case, the para product would be minimal. So, for these substituents, the para isomer's yield would be low.

Wait, but wait: for a meta director, like NO2, the nitro group is in the meta position relative to the incoming substituent. Wait, no, the substituent is on the benzene ring, and the incoming Br will attach in meta positions relative to the substituent.

Wait, let me clarify:

The substituent is in a certain position. When the substituent is a meta director, the incoming electrophile will add in the meta position relative to it. So, if the substituent is at position 1, the Br will add at position 3 and 5 (for meta directors).

Wait, but for para substitution, you need the substituent to be in a position that allows the incoming electrophile to add para to the substituent. But if the substituent is a meta director, it doesn't direct to the para position.

So, substituents that are o/p directors (like methyl, ethyl, Cl) will have more para product, while substituents that are meta directors (like NO2, COOEt, COOH) will have less para product.

Wait, but wait. For substituents that are o/p directors, the para product is possible. For substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not a major product. So, the para yield depends on whether the substituent is an o/p or meta director.

Now, let's think about each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): o/p director, so para is a major product. High para yield.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): o/p director, but deactivating. So, the ring is less reactive, but para is a major product.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): o/p director, activating. So, para is a major product, even more so because ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl? Wait, no, ethyl is an EDG but maybe less so than methyl? Not sure, but both methyl and ethyl are activating, o/p directors.

So, the para product is more for these.

Now, the substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) have low para yields. So, their para products are minor.

But wait, what's the order of the yield of the para isomer? The question is about arranging them from least to most in terms of the weight fraction of the para isomer.

So, the lower the para yield, the earlier it comes in the order.

So, substituents that are meta directors will have lower para yields. The substituents that are o/p directors will have higher para yields.

So, the substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors: so their para yields are low. Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors: their para yields are higher.

Wait, but the substituents 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but for the same substituent, the para product is formed.

So, the para yield is a function of the substituent's directing effect. So, the substituents that are o/p directors will have higher para yields, and those that are meta directors have lower.

So, the para yield from low to high would be:

Meta directors first, then o/p directors.

But within the meta directors, which have the least para yield? All meta directors have low, but perhaps their relative directing strengths affect the para yield.

Wait, but for meta directors, the para would be a minor product, so all meta directors have lower para yields than o/p directors. But among meta directors, the substituent's strength as a director might affect how much para is formed. Wait, no. Because meta directors don't direct to para; they direct to meta. So, the para would be a small fraction of the product, but perhaps the strength of the meta-directing effect affects the amount of para.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

The key is that for a substituent that is ortho/para-directing, the para product will be major, as the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to para and ortho positions. But in some cases, such as when the substituent is strongly activating and bulky, the ortho product may be less favored due to steric hindrance, leading to a higher para product. For example, toluene has a para product as the major product, with some ortho.

So, for substituents that are o/p directors, the para product is major, but the exact fraction depends on the substituent's size and the reaction conditions.

Now, for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is minor, as the substituent directs the electrophile to the meta positions. So, the para product is a minor product.

So, in this problem, the para yield from high to low would be:

o/p directors have higher para yields, meta directors have lower.

So, the order from least to most (increasing) para yield:

Meta directors first (2,4,6), then o/p directors (1,3,5).

Wait, but wait, the substituents 3 and 5 are o/p directors but deactivating. So, the ring is less reactive, but the para product is still formed.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, the substituents that are o/p directors would have a higher weight fraction of para.

Within the meta directors, which substituent would have the least para, and which would have more?

Wait, perhaps the strength of the meta-directing effect could influence the amount of para. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, substituents that are stronger deactivators might slow the reaction, but that's about reaction rate, not the selectivity of the product.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's ability to direct the electrophile determines where the substitution occurs. So, the more strongly a substituent directs to meta positions, the less para product is formed. So, substituents with strong meta-directing would have less para product.

So, the substituents are:

For meta directors: 

2) COOEt (ester)
4) NO2 (nitro)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Which of these is a stronger meta director? I think the nitro group is a stronger meta director than the ester or carboxylic acid groups. Wait, but wait, both COOEt and COOH are deactivating, but is nitro a stronger deactivator?

Yes, I think nitro is a stronger deactivating group than ester or COOH. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think: the order of deactivating strength is typically NO2 > COOH > COOR > COR (maybe). So, nitro is the strongest, followed by COOH, then ester (COOEt), then others.

But how does this affect the para product? If a substituent is a strong meta director, it would direct the electrophile to meta, so the para product would be less.

So, for substituent 4 (NO2), the para product would be the least, because the substituent is a strong meta director. Then substituent 6 (COOH) would have a bit more para, as it's a weaker meta director than NO2. Substituent 2 (COOEt) would have the most para among meta directors, but still much less than o/p directors.

Wait, but wait. If substituent 4 is a strong meta director, the para product would be minimal, so the fraction would be lower. So, 4 would have the lowest para yield, followed by 6, then 2.

Now, the o/p directors are substituents 1,3,5.

For these, the para product is the major product. Now, which among them would have the highest para yield?

Ah, the substituents 3 and 5 are deactivating, while 1 is activating. So, for substituent 1 (CH3), the ring is more reactive, so maybe the para product is higher. Wait, but wait. No, the substituent's directing effect is more important than the activation.

Wait, for activating groups, the ring is more reactive, so the reaction goes faster, but the para product is more due to directing. For deactivating o/p directors (like Cl and C2H5?), the ring is less reactive, but para is still a major product.

Wait, substituent 3 is Cl. Cl is a deactivating o/p director. So, the para product would form, but the reaction is slower. However, the question is about the weight fraction, not the rate. So, Cl directs to o/p, so the para product is a major fraction, but perhaps less than in the case of activating groups.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the substituent's strength as a director affects the ratio between ortho and para. For example, bulky substituents like methyl groups in the ortho position would lead to more para product because of steric hindrance, making the para product the major one.

So, substituent 1 (CH3): para is major.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): ethyl is a larger substituent than methyl. So, the para product would be even more favored because the ethyl group is bulkier, making the ortho product less favored.

So, substituent 5 may have a higher para yield than substituent 1. Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, substituent 5's ethyl group is less activating than methyl? No, ethyl is an activating group, just larger.

So, in terms of para yield, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl), because of steric effects.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, but an o/p director, the para product would still be formed, but perhaps in a lower proportion than in the activating groups. Or maybe not, because the para product is directed regardless of the activation.

Wait, perhaps the para product's yield is more influenced by the substituent's directing effect than by activation. So, as long as the substituent is o/p directing, the para product is a major product, regardless of whether the substituent is activating or deactivating.

So, substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors, so their para yields are high, in the order: 5 > 1 >3? Or maybe 3 is lower than 1 and 5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to approach it differently.

Each substituent's effect on the para product:

- For meta directors (2,4,6), para product is minor. So, their para yields are low. Among them, 4 (NO2) is the strongest meta director, leading to the least para product. So, 4 < 6 < 2.

- For o/p directors (1,3,5), para product is major. Among them, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para yield due to steric hindrance making para more favored than ortho. Substituent 1 (methyl) is next, and substituent 3 (Cl) has the least para yield among the o/p directors, perhaps because Cl is deactivating, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p directing, so para is a major product, but since Cl is deactivating, does that affect the product distribution? Or is it just about directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the deactivating substituent (like Cl) would have a lower rate of reaction, but the para product is still a major product once the reaction occurs.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction, so if the reaction is slower, but once it occurs, the para is major, then the para fraction could be high, but perhaps not as high as for activating substituents.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the expected order.

The meta directors (2,4,6) will have low para yields, with 4 < 6 < 2? Or 4 < 6 < 2? Or 4 < 2 < 6? I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's strength as a meta director affects how much para product is formed. A stronger meta director would have less para product.

So, substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger meta director than substituent 6 (COOH), which is stronger than substituent 2 (COOEt). So, the order from least to most para would be 4 < 6 < 2.

Then, the o/p directors (1,3,5) would have higher para yields.

Now, among the o/p directors, which has the highest para yield?

Substituent 5 (ethyl) may have higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl) because ethyl is bulkier, leading to more para product.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, but o/p directing. So, perhaps the para yield is lower than substituent 1 and 5 but higher than the meta directors.

So, the order of para yields from least to most would be:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating, but o/p directing. So, when the substituent is o/p directing, the para product is formed. But since Cl is deactivating, the para product's yield might be lower than in activating substituents. So, substituent 3's para yield would be higher than the meta directors but lower than the activating substituents.

So, the order would be:

Meta directors: 4 < 6 < 2

O/p directors: 3 < 1 < 5

So, combining them, the order from least to most para yield is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, no, because substituent 2 is a meta director, so it's in the first group.

Wait, perhaps:

The meta directors have lower para yields than the o/p directors.

So, the order would start with the meta directors (4,6,2), then the o/p directors (3,1,5).

Wait, but within the o/p directors, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the para yield might be lower than in the activating groups (1,5).

So, perhaps the order is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

But wait, substituent 5 is ethyl, which is activating and o/p directing. So, its para yield would be higher than substituent 1, which is methyl.

So, adding up, the order would be:

Substituents with the lowest para yield first: 4, 6, 2, then the o/p directors: 3, 1,5.

So, in terms of the weight fraction of para:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 2 is a meta director, so in the meta group, which is lower than the o/p directors.

So, the order from least to most para is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Now, looking at the options provided:

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm, the order I came up with is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which option matches this?

Looking at option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, in my order, substituent 3 comes after 2, before 1. So, option C has 4<6<2<1<5<3. So, substituent 3 is last in option C, but in my order, substituent 3 is before 1 and 5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my evaluation.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl).

Wait, that can't be right because substituent 1 and 5 are activating, so their para yields would be higher than substituent 3.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is higher than that of substituent 4,6,2, but lower than 1 and 5.

So, my initial order:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none exactly match this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the meta directors.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) has a higher para yield than substituent 6 (COOH), making the meta directors' order 4 <6 <2.

Wait, but no. Because substituent 6 is a stronger deactivator than 2, so perhaps 6 is a stronger meta director, leading to less para.

Wait, perhaps I got the order of substituents 2 and 6 wrong in the meta group.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is a stronger meta director than substituent 2 (COOEt), so 6 has lower para yield than 2.

Wait, perhaps the strength of the meta-directing effect is as follows: NO2 (4) > COOH (6) > COOEt (2). So, in terms of para yield, substituent 4 has the least, followed by 6, then 2.

So, the order of para yields would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C is:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, in option C, substituent 3 is last, which would be the highest para yield. But substituent 3 is Cl, which is a deactivating o/p director, so perhaps its para yield is higher than the activating groups? That doesn't make sense, because activating groups would have higher reactivity, leading to more para product.

Alternatively, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong, and substituent 3 (Cl) has a para yield higher than substituent 5 (ethyl).

Wait, perhaps the substituent's activating power affects the para yield. So, substituents 1 and 5 are activating, so their para yields are higher than substituent 3 (Cl), which is deactivating.

So, substituent 3's para yield is lower than 1 and 5, but higher than the meta directors.

So, the order for para yields would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which is the same as I had earlier.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, because in my order, substituent 3 is before 1 and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <3 <5.

But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 has a higher para yield than substituent 1. But that would mean Cl (deactivating) has higher para yield than methyl (activating), which doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the perspective of the activating and deactivating effects on the product distribution.

For substituents that are activating (1,5), the ring is more reactive, so the reaction is faster, and the product is more likely to be para because the o/p positions are favored. Hence, the para yield is higher.

For substituent 3 (Cl), it's deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but the directing effect is o/p. So, the para product is formed, but perhaps in a lower proportion than in activating groups because the ring is less reactive, but the product distribution is still o/p.

Wait, perhaps the substituents' activating or deactivating nature affects the ring's reactivity but not the product distribution as much as the directing effect. So, the para product's yield is more influenced by whether the substituent is o/p or meta director.

So, substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors. Their para yields are high, regardless of activation.

Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors. Their para yields are low.

Now, among the o/p directors, which has higher para yields? Perhaps the activating groups (1,5) have higher para yields than the deactivating group (3).

So, substituent 5 (ethyl) has higher para yield than 1 (methyl), which in turn is higher than 3 (Cl).

Thus, the order for o/p directors is 5 >1 >3.

And for meta directors, 4 <6 <2.

So, the overall order from least to most para would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none seem to match this exactly.

Wait, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, because in my order, substituent 3 comes before 1 and 5.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Hmm, that can't be right because substituent 3 should be higher than 4,6,2 but lower than 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have this exact order.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the substituents with more steric hindrance have less ortho product, leading to more para product. So, for o/p directors, substituents with larger groups would have higher para yields.

Substituent 5 (C2H5) is larger than 1 (CH3), so substituent 5 would have higher para yield than substituent 1.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is smaller than methyl and ethyl, so substituent 3's para yield would be higher than 4,6,2, but lower than 1 and 5.

Thus, the order would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none have this order.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, that's not correct because substituent 3 should come before 1 and 5.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

No, because 6 is after 2 in this option, which I think is incorrect.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3.

No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4.

No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of each substituent's para yield:

Substituent 4 (NO2): meta director, so para is minor → low yield.

Substituent 6 (COOH): meta director, para minor → lower than o/p directors.

Substituent 2 (COOEt): meta director, para minor → but perhaps higher than 4 and 6.

Substituent 3 (Cl): o/p director, deactivating, so para is major but less than activating substituents.

Substituent 1 (CH3): o/p director, activating → high para yield.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): o/p director, activating, larger substituent → higher para yield than 1.

So, the order of para yields from least to most is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

This order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match this.

Looking again at the options:

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, that's 4,6,2,1,5,3. So substituent 3 is last, which is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituents 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) has a lower para yield than substituent 2 (COOEt). Because COOH is a stronger deactivator than COOEt.

No, that's not correct. Both are meta directors, but perhaps substituent 6 is a stronger meta director, leading to lower para yields than 2.

So, substituent 6's para yield is lower than substituent 2's.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2.

Which would place substituent 6 after 4.

So, the order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But that's not matching my order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent 5 has the highest para yield, followed by 1, then 3.

In that case, the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

So, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Which option has this order?

None. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para yield than substituent 1 but higher than substituent 5? No, that can't be, because substituent 5 is ethyl, which is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is higher than substituent 5's. But that doesn't make sense because substituent 5 is activating.

Wait, perhaps substituent 5's para yield is the highest, then substituent 1, then substituent 3.

So, the order would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which is what I thought earlier. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <3 <5.

But again, that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the meta directors' para yields.

For each meta director, the para product is only formed when the substituent is in a position that allows the para position to be available. But in a benzene ring, substituents can have multiple positions for substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of multiple products. For example, in substituents that are meta directors, the para product would be a minor product, but perhaps the substituent's structure affects how much para is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate the ring affects the para product's yield even in deactivating o/p directors.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the correct order based on the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But according to my analysis, substituent 3 (Cl) should be before 1 and 5.

But perhaps the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is higher than substituent 1's.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is lower than substituent 1's.

In that case, substituent 3 comes after 1 and 5.

But no, that can't be.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should try to look for the answer.

Wait, another approach: the order of activating groups is stronger first.

The substituents 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5) are activating. Cl (3) is deactivating but o/p directing.

So, for bromination, the activating substituents would lead to higher yields of the para product, because the ring is more reactive, and the para position is favored.

So, substituent 5 (C2H5) would have the highest para yield, followed by 1 (CH3), then 3 (Cl). Because the activating groups make the reaction faster and more selective for para.

The meta directors (2,4,6) would have lower para yields, with 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt).

So, the overall order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

So, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But that would place substituent 3 after 5, which I don't think is correct.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is higher than substituent 1 and 5.

But no, because substituent 3 is deactivating, so the para product would be a major product but not as much as in activating substituents.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But that would have substituent 3 (Cl) at the end, which I don't think is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But that's 4,2,6, which I think is incorrect because 6 should come after 4.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the actual products.

For substituent 4 (NO2), the para product is minor.

For substituent 6 (COOH), the para product is minor.

For substituent 2 (COOEt), the para product is minor.

For substituent 3 (Cl), the para product is major, but since Cl is deactivating, the reaction is slower, but once it does happen, the para product is major.

So, substituent 3's para product is higher than meta directors but lower than activating groups.

Thus, the order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But I don't see this in the options.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the number of possible para products.

Wait, perhaps I should look at each substituent's ability to form para products.

Another point: when a substituent is strongly activating, like -NH2, the para product is very high. But in this case, we don't have such groups.

So, substituents 1 and 5 are activating, so they have high para yields.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but o/p directing, so para is a major product.

Thus, substituent 3's para yield is higher than meta directors but lower than 1 and 5.

So, the overall order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But this still isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But that would have substituent 3 (Cl) last, which can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C, and I'm wrong about substituent 3's position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that substituent 3's para product is lower than substituent 5's but higher than 1's.

Wait, that would make the order 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches.

I'm starting to think that I might have made a mistake in the initial analysis, perhaps about substituent 3's para yield.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is actually lower than substituent 4,6,2, but that can't be because substituent 3 is an o/p director.

Wait, no, substituent 3 is an o/p director, so its para yield is higher than meta directors.

So, substituent 3 is higher than 2,6,4.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But that would mean substituent 3 (Cl) has the highest para yield, which I think is correct.

Wait, substituent 3 is o/p directing, so it's para yield is higher than meta directors, which is correct. Among o/p directors, substituent 5 (ethyl) is activating and larger, so higher para yield than 1 (methyl), which is activating but smaller.

So, substituent 5 has higher para yield than substituent 1.

So, substituent 3's para yield is higher than 4,6,2, but lower than 1 and 5.

So, the order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

So, perhaps option C is the intended correct answer.

In that case, substituent 3's para yield is lower than substituent 1 and 5, but higher than meta directors.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But option C has substituent 3 after 5, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is as in option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each substituent's para yield as follows:

- NO2: lowest para yield (as it's a strong meta director)
- COOH: next (moderate meta director)
- COOEt: higher than NO2 and COOH (weaker meta director)
- Cl: o/p directing but deactivating → higher para than meta directors but lower than activating groups
- CH3: activating, higher para than Cl
- C2H5: activating, highest para (as ethyl is bulkier than methyl → more para product)

So, the order is:

NO2 < COOH < COOEt < Cl < CH3 < C2H5.

Which corresponds to substituents 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, this isn't an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But that would place substituent 3 (Cl) after 5, which would mean Cl has a lower para yield than 1 and 5, which is correct.

Wait, no. Option C's order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which would make substituent 3 (Cl) the last, meaning the highest para yield. But Cl is deactivating, so its para yield should be higher than meta directors but lower than activating groups.

Thus, the correct order would be substituent 3 before substituent 1 and 5.

So, perhaps the correct option is not among the choices, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the substituents' directing effects, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to ortho, para, or meta positions. The para-isomer yield depends on the substituent's directing and activating/deactivating nature:

1. **Substituents 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO₂), and 6 (COOH)**: These are **meta-directing groups** because they are electron-withdrawing. As meta directors, they do not favor para substitution, resulting in low para-isomer yields. Among these, **NO₂** is the strongest meta director, followed by **COOH**, and then **COOEt**. Thus, the order for meta directors is **4 < 6 < 2**.

2. **Substituents 1 (CH₃), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C₂H₅)**: These are **ortho/para-directing groups** because they are electron-donating. As ortho/para directors, they favor para substitution, resulting in higher para-isomer yields. However:
   - **CH₃** and **C₂H₅** are **activating groups**, making the ring more reactive and increasing the likelihood of para substitution. Among these, **C₂H₅** (larger substituent) has a higher para yield than **CH₃** due to steric hindrance reducing ortho substitution.
   - **Cl** is a **deactivating group** but still ortho/para-directing. Despite the deactivation, para substitution is favored, but the yield is lower than for activating groups. Thus, the order for ortho/para directors is **3 < 1 < 5**.

Combining these observations, the overall order of increasing para-isomer yield is:

**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C) 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**

However, this option places **Cl (substituent 3)** after **CH₃ (substituent 1)** and **C₂H₅ (substituent 5)**, which is inconsistent with the analysis since **Cl** should have a higher para yield than **CH₃** and **C₂H₅**. Despite this discrepancy, **C** is the most reasonable choice based on the provided options.

Answer: C
