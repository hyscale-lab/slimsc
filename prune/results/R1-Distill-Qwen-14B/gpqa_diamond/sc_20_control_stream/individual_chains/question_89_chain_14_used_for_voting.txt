Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, there are several steps leading to product 3, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

First, let's break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR and IR data are given.

IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that suggests some kind of elimination or maybe a substitution that forms a carbonyl group. Since it's KOH, maybe an E2 elimination is happening, forming a ketone? Wait, or perhaps it's a di-elimination, forming an epoxide? No, wait, that's more for vicinal dihalides. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction of KOH with 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lead to an elimination to form an alkene, but that would give a double bond. But the IR is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone.

Wait, wait. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure. When KOH is heated with a dihalide, perhaps it leads to a double elimination, forming a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, but with KOH, substitution would take time, especially at high temps. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so the bromines are on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would typically lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination type scenario, but Hofmann usually involves amines. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a bridge, leading to a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH- in a substitution, but that would give a diol. But wait, the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen. Because 4.79 is typical for something like an ether or an alcohol, but more likely an ethereal OCH₂ group.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide, but no, epoxide would show a different NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone but that's a carbonyl, but then the NMR would have a singlet for the carbonyl, but that's not part of the 1H NMR.

Wait, the NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), then a bunch of peaks around 2.41-2.23 (10H), which could be multiple CH₂ groups, and 1.94 (2H) which might be another CH₂. So let me think.

If the product is 1,3-adamantanone, which is a ketone, the structure would be similar to adamantane with a ketone group. But wait, how many protons would that have? The 1H NMR would have peaks for the CH groups around the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that might not fit with the IR.

Wait, another thought: when dibromides are treated with a base like KOH, especially in a vicinal dihalide, you can get elimination forming an alkene. But then the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ for a C=C. But in this case, the IR is at 1720, which is more for a carbonyl. So maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide? No, epoxide would require an oxygen between the two carbons. Alternatively, maybe the base isn't acting on the dihalide but perhaps doing something else.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate and lead to a ring expansion or contraction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: product 1's NMR. Let's consider what each peak could be.

4.79 ppm (2H): Maybe an OCH₂ group. Like an ether or an epoxide.

But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound is a ketone adjacent to an ether. Hmm, maybe a cyclic ketone ether? Or perhaps after elimination, we get a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could form an epoxide. Wait, no, because epoxide would have different NMR characteristics. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But then, the IR would show a strong carbonyl. But the NMR would have different shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR data.

The product 1 has 1H NMR:

4.79 (2H) – maybe an OCH₂ group.

2.41-2.23 (10H) – probably multiple CH₂ groups, possibly in a rigid structure like adamantane.

1.94 (2H) – maybe another CH₂ group.

So maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanediol, but that would have OH protons, which usually appear broad. But the NMR doesn't mention any broad signals, so perhaps it's an ether.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-dioxolane or some cyclic ether, but that's unlikely from a dibromide with KOH.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When vicinal dihalides react with strong bases, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enol elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a gem-diol elimination, but that's more for ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but the product would have two OH groups, which would show as broad peaks in the NMR. But the given NMR doesn't mention any broad signals, so substitution to form a diol is unlikely.

Wait, another idea: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene and release HBr. But then the product would be 1,3-diene, but that would show a peak in the IR for a double bond. However, the IR here is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more consistent with a carbonyl group.

Hmm, maybe elimination leads to an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, thinking about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid structure, so the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the structure. Removing two HBr molecules would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a bridge, leading to a ketone.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. The integration is 2H, 10H, and 2H. So total 14 H. The original molecule, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, has a structure with 10 CH2 groups and 4 CH groups? Wait, no, adamantane has the structure with four CH groups, I think. Let me recall: adamantane has four equivalent CH groups. So the molecular formula is C10H16. So the starting material would be C10H14Br2.

When KOH is used, in elimination, each Br would be replaced by H, so the product would have C10H18, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which would have one less H (since carbonyl replaces CH₂). 

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then the formula would be C10H14O. Because each Br substitution would add an O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantandione, which is a diketone. But then, the NMR would show more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone. For example, if elimination leads to a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is likely a ketone. So, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH forms 1,3-adamantandione? Or perhaps it's a single ketone.

Wait, but in that case, what would the NMR look like? The most deshielded protons would be near the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Wait, but then the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O-C stretch. But in the given IR, the main peak is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

So, maybe the product is a ketone. So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantandione, which is a diketone. So, the structure would have two ketone groups.

But then, the NMR would have peaks for the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the CH₂ next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. If it's a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for the CH₂ groups next to the ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, but that would require an oxygen bridge.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing an elimination to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. So, the product would be a ketone. 

Assuming that, product 1 is a ketone.

Now, moving on to step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation, but that requires an acylium ion. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but on what? Wait, product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's being used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation to form a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing a ring expansion.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid, it could undergo some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. Alternatively, if product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, perhaps the Lewis acid facilitates a ring-opening to form a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and with Al isopropoxide, it could undergo a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) under acidic conditions rearranges to a ketone or aldehyde. But product 1 is a ketone, not a diol. So that might not fit.

Wait, but product 1 might not be a diol. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and Al isopropoxide is causing it to undergo some kind of electrocyclic ring-opening or other pericyclic reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is adamantane with a ketone group, so heating with Al isopropoxide would not change much. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate would need to have an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative, but that's not clear.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me proceed to the next step and see if that helps.

Step 3: Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This forms product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 is likely the ozonolysis product of product 2.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 is an alkene. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. How does product 1 become product 2, which is an alkene?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Wait, Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid; perhaps it causes an E1cb mechanism for elimination. So, if product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent hydrogen, perhaps elimination forms an alkene.

Wait, but a ketone adjacent to a hydrogen? Let's think: if product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but no, the IR doesn't show OH. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but the IR doesn't show ester carbonyl (which is around 1740 cm⁻¹, maybe a bit lower). Wait, the IR is 1720, which is a typical ketone.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 must be an alkene. How does that happen?

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening to form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and the Lewis acid causes some rearrangement to form a more stable structure with a double bond.

But I'm not quite getting it. Let me think about the possible structures.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps when it's treated with Al isopropoxide, a base, it could lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, for example, if product 1 has a structure where the ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group, elimination could form a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is 1-adamantanone, then perhaps the structure is such that a neighboring hydrogen can be abstracted, leading to elimination and forming an alkene.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged ketone, and the Lewis acid causes a ring expansion or the formation of a new ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of product 1 (a ketone) with Al isopropoxide is leading to some kind of enolate formation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is not a ketone, but another structure. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's go back.

Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an example of the Hoffman elimination, but that's for amines. Perhaps more likely, it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. So, the product would be 1,3-diene? But then the IR would show a C=C peak. But the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, so that's not matching.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the NMR of product 1 again. The peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). If the 4.79 ppm is for a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps it's an epoxide. Let me imagine an epoxide structure.

If the product is an epoxide, then the structure would have an oxygen connecting two carbons that were previously substituted with Br. In that case, the NMR would show a triplet or other splitting for the CH₂ groups in the epoxide.

Wait, but the IR of an epoxide shows strong absorption around 1250 cm⁻¹ due to the C-O-C stretch. But in the given data, the IR is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's not an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm peak is from a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me imagine a structure where a CH₂ group is next to a ketone. So, perhaps a structure like (CH₂)₂CO, but in a more complex adamantane framework.

Wait, but the coupling in the NMR of product 3 is what we're after. Let's move forward.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. For example, if product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis adduct.

But for ozonolysis, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

Wait, in ozonolysis, when you cleave a double bond, you form carbonyl groups. So, in product 3, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl, perhaps as part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl.

So, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something similar. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. The resulting molecule would have two ketones, perhaps.

Then, in product 3, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would show up downfield. The coupling would depend on the neighboring Hs.

But more specifically, if the structure after ozonolysis has a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, then the protons would couple with both sets, leading to a triplet of triplets or some more complex splitting.

Wait, in the case of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl (like (CH₂)₂CO), the two protons on the CH₂ would each see the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group. So, each H would have coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets? Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets if there are neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to multiple splitting.

But I'm not entirely certain yet. Let me think again about the steps.

So first, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl) via KOH. Then product 1 → product 2 (with alkene) via Al isopropoxide. Then product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis product) via ozone and DMS.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was in product 2.

In the ozonolysis step, the ozonide is formed, which upon work-up with DMS (a reductive work-up) gives aldehydes or ketones depending on the substitution of the double bond.

But considering that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the product 2 would have a bridged double bond. Ozonolysis of such a structure would break the bridge and form two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to two ketones. The resulting product would have two carbonyl groups connected via a chain.

But in the case of adamantane derivatives, the exact structure would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps ozonolysis leads to a diketone structure, with the most deshielded protons being on the carbonyl-adjacent CH₂ groups.

So, in product 3, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded and appear downfield. The coupling pattern would be influenced by the neighboring CH₂ groups.

Let me imagine that in product 3, a CH₂ group is next to a carbonyl, and is adjacent to another CH₂ group which is itself adjacent to another CH₂. So, the protons on the first CH₂ would see the two protons on the next CH₂ and perhaps others.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to coupling with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,3-diketone. Then, the CH₂ groups adjacent to each ketone would have two Hs each. Each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the neighboring CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet.

Wait, another thought: If a CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then each CH₂ would have two Hs each, and each H would see the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be a triplet. Because each proton is split by two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, no. Let me think: each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. For each H, the coupling would be with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But since each H on the first CH₂ is equivalent, the splitting would be a triplet. But wait, if the adjacent CH₂ is further split into a triplet by another group, would that affect it?

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is only adjacent to one other CH₂, leading to each H splitting into a triplet.

Wait, but wait. Let's consider a simple structure: (CH₂)₂(CO)₂. Each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. So, the Hs on each CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be a triplet, because n+1 where n=2 (two adjacent Hs).

So, each H would be a triplet. But wait, in this case, the CH₂ groups are in the middle, so each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other? Or perhaps not, depending on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct coupling for each H is a triplet. So, in product 3, the most deshielded Hs would be in a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is a triplet.

Alternatively, if the Hs are coupled with two sets of neighboring Hs, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other side, the splitting could be more complex.

Hmm. Another approach: Let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. If product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, the ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have a structure where two carbonyls are connected through a chain.

For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would give two ketones, perhaps leading to two separate carbonyl groups connected via a bridge.

But perhaps in product 3, the structure is such that a CH₂ group is adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group which is adjacent to another set of CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH₂ group that is adjacent to a carbonyl and is next to another CH₂ group which is itself adjacent to another CH₂. So, each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, another thought: If the structure is (CH₂)₂(CO)₂, then each CH₂ is next to two other CH₂ groups. Each H on a CH₂ would see two Hs from one adjacent CH₂ and two Hs from the other, but in reality, maybe they're only next to one CH₂. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of neighboring Hs. For a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, if the next group is another CH₂, each H on the first CH₂ would see two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be split into a triplet (n=2 → triplet). If the adjacent CH₂ is also adjacent to another CH₂, but that's further away, perhaps the coupling is not observed due to being beyond the J coupling range.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling constants might not be that long. So, each H would only couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. So, the most deshielded Hs would be triplets.

But looking at the options, option A is a triplet. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. So, in product 3, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl are on a CH₂ group. Each of these Hs is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H is split into a triplet. So, the coupling pattern is a triplet. So, the answer would be A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH₂ group is between two carbonyls, the Hs on the CH₂ might be coupled with two Hs on each side, but if the groups on both sides are different, it could lead to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for example, if a CH₂ is between two different groups, each with two Hs, but those Hs might not be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is adjacent to two different sets of Hs, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a split from two neighboring groups. For instance, each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and two Hs from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the number of neighboring Hs.

If a proton is coupled with two sets of two protons each, the splitting would be (n1 +1)(n2 +1), where n1 and n2 are the number of neighboring protons in each coupling. So, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, the splitting would be (2+1)(2+1) = 9, a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled with two Hs from one side and one H from the other. That would lead to (2+1)(1+1) = 6, a sextet. But that's also not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH₂ and one H on another. So, (2+1)(1+1) = 6 again.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ group is only coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group. So, each H would be a triplet. That would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ group is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other. So, each H would split into a triplet (from two Hs) and a doublet (from one H), leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

So, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, if the structure is such that the CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups, then each CH₂ group's Hs are next to two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. Wait, but in that case, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two on each side), which would split into a quintet (n=4 → pentet). But that would be option D.

But that's a possibility. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, but that would require the groups on both sides to have Hs. However, if the groups on both sides are carbonyls, then perhaps the Hs are only on one side.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, the structure would be something like R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R', assuming the double bond was in the middle. So, each CH₂ group would be adjacent to a carbonyl on one side and another CH₂ on the other. So, each H on the middle CH₂ would see two Hs from the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-O, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R, where R is another group.

In that case, each CH₂ group is between a carbonyl and another CH₂. So, each H on the middle CH₂ would see two Hs from the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups, then each H would see two Hs on each side, but that would require a geminal di carbonyl, which is unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ group is adjacent to only one other CH₂ group, so each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded Hs in product 3 are on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled with two Hs from an adjacent CH₂ group. Hence, the coupling pattern is a triplet.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, and the goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH at 240°C. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination, likely forming a ketone. The NMR data for product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). These peaks suggest a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen (likely a ketone) and other CH₂ groups in a rigid framework, consistent with a ketone derivative of adamantane, such as 1-adamantanone.

### Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces an elimination reaction, forming an alkene (product 2). The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is assumed to be an alkene, as ozonolysis in the next step targets double bonds.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

### Analysis of Coupling in Product 3
In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. This is consistent with the NMR splitting rules, where each hydrogen is split by two equivalent neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, there are several steps leading to product 3, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

First, let's break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR and IR data are given.

IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that suggests some kind of elimination or maybe a substitution that forms a carbonyl group. Since it's KOH, maybe an E2 elimination is happening, forming a ketone? Wait, or perhaps it's a di-elimination, forming an epoxide? No, wait, that's more for vicinal dihalides. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction of KOH with 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lead to an elimination to form an alkene, but that would give a double bond. But the IR is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone.

Wait, wait. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure. When KOH is heated with a dihalide, perhaps it leads to a double elimination, forming a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, but with KOH, substitution would take time, especially at high temps. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so the bromines are on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would typically lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination type scenario, but Hofmann usually involves amines. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a bridge, leading to a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH- in a substitution, but that would give a diol. But wait, the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen. Because 4.79 is typical for something like an ether or an alcohol, but more likely an ethereal OCH₂ group.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide, but no, epoxide would show a different NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone but that's a carbonyl, but then the NMR would have a singlet for the carbonyl, but that's not part of the 1H NMR.

Wait, the NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), then a bunch of peaks around 2.41-2.23 (10H), which could be multiple CH₂ groups, and 1.94 (2H) which might be another CH₂. So let me think.

If the product is 1,3-adamantanone, which is a ketone, the structure would be similar to adamantane with a ketone group. But wait, how many protons would that have? The 1H NMR would have peaks for the CH groups around the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that might not fit with the IR.

Wait, another thought: when dibromides are treated with a base like KOH, especially in a vicinal dihalide, you can get elimination forming an alkene. But then the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ for a C=C. But in this case, the IR is at 1720, which is more for a carbonyl. So maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide? No, epoxide would require an oxygen between the two carbons. Alternatively, maybe the base isn't acting on the dihalide but perhaps doing something else.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate and lead to a ring expansion or contraction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: product 1's NMR. Let's consider what each peak could be.

4.79 ppm (2H): Maybe an OCH₂ group. Like an ether or an epoxide.

But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound is a ketone adjacent to an ether. Hmm, maybe a cyclic ketone ether? Or perhaps after elimination, we get a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could form an epoxide. Wait, no, because epoxide would have different NMR characteristics. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But then, the IR would show a strong carbonyl. But the NMR would have different shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR data.

The product 1 has 1H NMR:

4.79 (2H) – maybe an OCH₂ group.

2.41-2.23 (10H) – probably multiple CH₂ groups, possibly in a rigid structure like adamantane.

1.94 (2H) – maybe another CH₂ group.

So maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanediol, but that would have OH protons, which usually appear broad. But the NMR doesn't mention any broad signals, so perhaps it's an ether.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-dioxolane or some cyclic ether, but that's unlikely from a dibromide with KOH.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When vicinal dihalides react with strong bases, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enol elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a gem-diol elimination, but that's more for ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but the product would have two OH groups, which would show as broad peaks in the NMR. But the given NMR doesn't mention any broad signals, so substitution to form a diol is unlikely.

Wait, another idea: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene and release HBr. But then the product would be 1,3-diene, but that would show a peak in the IR for a double bond. However, the IR here is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more consistent with a carbonyl group.

Hmm, maybe elimination leads to an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, thinking about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid structure, so the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the structure. Removing two HBr molecules would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a bridge, leading to a ketone.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. The integration is 2H, 10H, and 2H. So total 14 H. The original molecule, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, has a structure with 10 CH2 groups and 4 CH groups? Wait, no, adamantane has the structure with four CH groups, I think. Let me recall: adamantane has four equivalent CH groups. So the molecular formula is C10H16. So the starting material would be C10H14Br2.

When KOH is used, in elimination, each Br would be replaced by H, so the product would have C10H18, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which would have one less H (since carbonyl replaces CH₂). 

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then the formula would be C10H14O. Because each Br substitution would add an O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantandione, which is a diketone. But then, the NMR would show more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone. For example, if elimination leads to a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is likely a ketone. So, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH forms 1,3-adamantandione? Or perhaps it's a single ketone.

Wait, but in that case, what would the NMR look like? The most deshielded protons would be near the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Wait, but then the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O-C stretch. But in the given IR, the main peak is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

So, maybe the product is a ketone. So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantandione, which is a diketone. So, the structure would have two ketone groups.

But then, the NMR would have peaks for the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the CH₂ next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. If it's a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for the CH₂ groups next to the ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, but that would require an oxygen bridge.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing an elimination to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. So, the product would be a ketone. 

Assuming that, product 1 is a ketone.

Now, moving on to step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation, but that requires an acylium ion. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but on what? Wait, product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's being used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation to form a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing a ring expansion.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid, it could undergo some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. Alternatively, if product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, perhaps the Lewis acid facilitates a ring-opening to form a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and with Al isopropoxide, it could undergo a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) under acidic conditions rearranges to a ketone or aldehyde. But product 1 is a ketone, not a diol. So that might not fit.

Wait, but product 1 might not be a diol. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and Al isopropoxide is causing it to undergo some kind of electrocyclic ring-opening or other pericyclic reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is adamantane with a ketone group, so heating with Al isopropoxide would not change much. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate would need to have an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative, but that's not clear.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me proceed to the next step and see if that helps.

Step 3: Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This forms product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 is likely the ozonolysis product of product 2.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 is an alkene. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. How does product 1 become product 2, which is an alkene?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Wait, Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid; perhaps it causes an E1cb mechanism for elimination. So, if product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent hydrogen, perhaps elimination forms an alkene.

Wait, but a ketone adjacent to a hydrogen? Let's think: if product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but no, the IR doesn't show OH. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but the IR doesn't show ester carbonyl (which is around 1740 cm⁻¹, maybe a bit lower). Wait, the IR is 1720, which is a typical ketone.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 must be an alkene. How does that happen?

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening to form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and the Lewis acid causes some rearrangement to form a more stable structure with a double bond.

But I'm not quite getting it. Let me think about the possible structures.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps when it's treated with Al isopropoxide, a base, it could lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, for example, if product 1 has a structure where the ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group, elimination could form a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is 1-adamantanone, then perhaps the structure is such that a neighboring hydrogen can be abstracted, leading to elimination and forming an alkene.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged ketone, and the Lewis acid causes a ring expansion or the formation of a new ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of product 1 (a ketone) with Al isopropoxide is leading to some kind of enolate formation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is not a ketone, but another structure. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's go back.

Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an example of the Hoffman elimination, but that's for amines. Perhaps more likely, it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. So, the product would be 1,3-diene? But then the IR would show a C=C peak. But the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, so that's not matching.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the NMR of product 1 again. The peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). If the 4.79 ppm is for a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps it's an epoxide. Let me imagine an epoxide structure.

If the product is an epoxide, then the structure would have an oxygen connecting two carbons that were previously substituted with Br. In that case, the NMR would show a triplet or other splitting for the CH₂ groups in the epoxide.

Wait, but the IR of an epoxide shows strong absorption around 1250 cm⁻¹ due to the C-O-C stretch. But in the given data, the IR is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's not an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm peak is from a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me imagine a structure where a CH₂ group is next to a ketone. So, perhaps a structure like (CH₂)₂CO, but in a more complex adamantane framework.

Wait, but the coupling in the NMR of product 3 is what we're after. Let's move forward.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. For example, if product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis adduct.

But for ozonolysis, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

Wait, in ozonolysis, when you cleave a double bond, you form carbonyl groups. So, in product 3, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl, perhaps as part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl.

So, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something similar. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. The resulting molecule would have two ketones, perhaps.

Then, in product 3, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would show up downfield. The coupling would depend on the neighboring Hs.

But more specifically, if the structure after ozonolysis has a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, then the protons would couple with both sets, leading to a triplet of triplets or some more complex splitting.

Wait, in the case of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl (like (CH₂)₂CO), the two protons on the CH₂ would each see the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group. So, each H would have coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets? Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets if there are neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to multiple splitting.

But I'm not entirely certain yet. Let me think again about the steps.

So first, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl) via KOH. Then product 1 → product 2 (with alkene) via Al isopropoxide. Then product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis product) via ozone and DMS.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was in product 2.

In the ozonolysis step, the ozonide is formed, which upon work-up with DMS (a reductive work-up) gives aldehydes or ketones depending on the substitution of the double bond.

But considering that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the product 2 would have a bridged double bond. Ozonolysis of such a structure would break the bridge and form two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to two ketones. The resulting product would have two carbonyl groups connected via a chain.

But in the case of adamantane derivatives, the exact structure would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps ozonolysis leads to a diketone structure, with the most deshielded protons being on the carbonyl-adjacent CH₂ groups.

So, in product 3, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded and appear downfield. The coupling pattern would be influenced by the neighboring CH₂ groups.

Let me imagine that in product 3, a CH₂ group is next to a carbonyl, and is adjacent to another CH₂ group which is itself adjacent to another CH₂. So, the protons on the first CH₂ would see the two protons on the next CH₂ and perhaps others.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to coupling with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,3-diketone. Then, the CH₂ groups adjacent to each ketone would have two Hs each. Each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the neighboring CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet.

Wait, another thought: If a CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then each CH₂ would have two Hs each, and each H would see the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be a triplet. Because each proton is split by two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, no. Let me think: each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. For each H, the coupling would be with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But since each H on the first CH₂ is equivalent, the splitting would be a triplet. But wait, if the adjacent CH₂ is further split into a triplet by another group, would that affect it?

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is only adjacent to one other CH₂, leading to each H splitting into a triplet.

Wait, but wait. Let's consider a simple structure: (CH₂)₂(CO)₂. Each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. So, the Hs on each CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be a triplet, because n+1 where n=2 (two adjacent Hs).

So, each H would be a triplet. But wait, in this case, the CH₂ groups are in the middle, so each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other? Or perhaps not, depending on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct coupling for each H is a triplet. So, in product 3, the most deshielded Hs would be in a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is a triplet.

Alternatively, if the Hs are coupled with two sets of neighboring Hs, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other side, the splitting could be more complex.

Hmm. Another approach: Let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. If product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, the ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have a structure where two carbonyls are connected through a chain.

For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would give two ketones, perhaps leading to two separate carbonyl groups connected via a bridge.

But perhaps in product 3, the structure is such that a CH₂ group is adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group which is adjacent to another set of CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH₂ group that is adjacent to a carbonyl and is next to another CH₂ group which is itself adjacent to another CH₂. So, each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, another thought: If the structure is (CH₂)₂(CO)₂, then each CH₂ is next to two other CH₂ groups. Each H on a CH₂ would see two Hs from one adjacent CH₂ and two Hs from the other, but in reality, maybe they're only next to one CH₂. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of neighboring Hs. For a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, if the next group is another CH₂, each H on the first CH₂ would see two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be split into a triplet (n=2 → triplet). If the adjacent CH₂ is also adjacent to another CH₂, but that's further away, perhaps the coupling is not observed due to being beyond the J coupling range.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling constants might not be that long. So, each H would only couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. So, the most deshielded Hs would be triplets.

But looking at the options, option A is a triplet. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. So, in product 3, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl are on a CH₂ group. Each of these Hs is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H is split into a triplet. So, the coupling pattern is a triplet. So, the answer would be A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH₂ group is between two carbonyls, the Hs on the CH₂ might be coupled with two Hs on each side, but if the groups on both sides are different, it could lead to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for example, if a CH₂ is between two different groups, each with two Hs, but those Hs might not be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is adjacent to two different sets of Hs, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a split from two neighboring groups. For instance, each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and two Hs from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the number of neighboring Hs.

If a proton is coupled with two sets of two protons each, the splitting would be (n1 +1)(n2 +1), where n1 and n2 are the number of neighboring protons in each coupling. So, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, the splitting would be (2+1)(2+1) = 9, a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled with two Hs from one side and one H from the other. That would lead to (2+1)(1+1) = 6, a sextet. But that's also not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH₂ and one H on another. So, (2+1)(1+1) = 6 again.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ group is only coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group. So, each H would be a triplet. That would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ group is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other. So, each H would split into a triplet (from two Hs) and a doublet (from one H), leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

So, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, if the structure is such that the CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups, then each CH₂ group's Hs are next to two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. Wait, but in that case, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two on each side), which would split into a quintet (n=4 → pentet). But that would be option D.

But that's a possibility. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, but that would require the groups on both sides to have Hs. However, if the groups on both sides are carbonyls, then perhaps the Hs are only on one side.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, the structure would be something like R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R', assuming the double bond was in the middle. So, each CH₂ group would be adjacent to a carbonyl on one side and another CH₂ on the other. So, each H on the middle CH₂ would see two Hs from the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-O, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R, where R is another group.

In that case, each CH₂ group is between a carbonyl and another CH₂. So, each H on the middle CH₂ would see two Hs from the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups, then each H would see two Hs on each side, but that would require a geminal di carbonyl, which is unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ group is adjacent to only one other CH₂ group, so each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded Hs in product 3 are on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled with two Hs from an adjacent CH₂ group. Hence, the coupling pattern is a triplet.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, and the goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH at 240°C. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination, likely forming a ketone. The NMR data for product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). These peaks suggest a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen (likely a ketone) and other CH₂ groups in a rigid framework, consistent with a ketone derivative of adamantane, such as 1-adamantanone.

### Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces an elimination reaction, forming an alkene (product 2). The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is assumed to be an alkene, as ozonolysis in the next step targets double bonds.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

### Analysis of Coupling in Product 3
In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. This is consistent with the NMR splitting rules, where each hydrogen is split by two equivalent neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

**Answer: A**
