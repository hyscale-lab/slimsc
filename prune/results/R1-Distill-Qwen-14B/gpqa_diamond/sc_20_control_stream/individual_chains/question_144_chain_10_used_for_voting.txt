Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, so what's the mean decay distance? I remember that particles moving relativistically will have a mean decay length that depends on their lifetime and velocity. But since mesons are bosons, I think they're pretty light and move at speeds close to the speed of light.

The mean lifetime of a particle is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, right? The uncertainty in energy (which relates to the width Γ) gives an uncertainty in time, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, Γ is the decay width, and it's related to the lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ). So that's the first step.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me get the units right. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, but when working in units where c=1, like GeV and seconds, I think ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm that: yes, ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

So the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait no wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 6.582 divided by 0.32. Hmm, 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.568 times. So yes, 20.568e-25 s, which is 2.0568e-24 seconds. Hmm, but wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is actually 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 is indeed approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but I think I may have mixed up the units. Let me make sure. ħ is in GeV·s, and Γ is in GeV, so the units will cancel correctly. So yes, tau is in seconds.

Now, next part. The mean decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ. But what's the velocity v of the meson? Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, but in units where c=1, E in GeV, mass in GeV/c², but I'll have to handle the units carefully.

So the energy of the meson is given as E_X =8 GeV. The rest mass is m_X =1.2 GeV/c². So the total energy E is gamma * m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But since c=1 in these units, E = gamma * m. So gamma = E/(m) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667. The velocity v is given by beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). So let's compute beta.

Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta is roughly 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 1/gamma²: (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So yes, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that: 0.9887 *3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Okay, now the mean decay length L is v * tau.

We have tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = let's compute that.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiply 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.966 * 2 =5.932, 2.966 *0.056875 ≈ 0.1685, so total around 6.099.

So 6.099e(8-24) = 6.099e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait. 2.966e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) = 6.099e-16 m.

But looking at the answer options, option A is 5.0223e-16, and option D is 4.0655e-16. Hmm, but my calculation gives around 6e-16, which isn't among the options. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me go back. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau is ħ / (Gamma) = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV.

Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s. So tau is 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Wait, maybe I messed up the velocity calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, gamma = E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.66667 (approx).

So beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is not exactly 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's see: 0.98 squared is 0.9604, 0.988 squared is (0.988)^2 = 0.976144, that's close to 0.9775. So let's compute 0.988^2 = 0.976144. The difference between 0.9775 and 0.976144 is 0.001356.

So let's use a linear approximation. Let x = 0.988, and we want to find x+delta such that (x+delta)^2 = 0.9775.

Expanding, x² + 2x delta + delta² = 0.9775. Since delta is small, delta² is negligible.

So 0.976144 + 2*(0.988)*delta ≈ 0.9775.

The difference is 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

So 2*0.988 * delta ≈ 0.001356 → delta ≈ 0.001356/(2*0.988) ≈ 0.001356/(1.976) ≈ ~0.000687.

So x + delta ≈ 0.988 + 0.000687 ≈ 0.988687.

So beta is approximately 0.988687, which is about 0.9887 c. So that part was correct.

So v is approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Calculating that: 2.9661e8 * 2.0568e-24 = ?

Multiply 2.9661 * 2.0568 → Let me compute that.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322. 2.9661 * 0.0568 ≈ 0.1687.

So total is approximately 5.9322 +0.1687=6.1009. So 6.1009e(8-24)=6.1009e-16 meters.

But the options aren't anywhere near 6e-16. The options are around 4e-15 and 5e-15, and 4e-16 and 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute this more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of tau. Let me compute tau again.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 → let me compute that exactly.

0.32 × 20 =6.4 → 6.582-6.4=0.182 → 0.32 * 0.56875=0.182. So 20.56875.

So tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Hmm, v is 0.9887c → 0.9887 *3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8-24 → 6.1009 * 1e-16.

So 6.1009e-16 meters. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe I should consider relativistic gamma in the lifetime equation. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma)). Wait, no, because Gamma is the total decay width, which is frame-dependent, but the lifetime is tau = ħ/(Gamma). But wait, when a particle is moving, its decay width might not change? Or does it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is the same in all frames because it's a Lorentz-invariant quantity? Or is it?

Hmm, I recall that the total width Γ is the same in all frames because it's related to the inverse of the proper lifetime. So tau_0 = ħ/(Γ). So in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau_0.

Wait, wait, no. Because the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime as Γ = ħ / tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (in the rest frame). So, if the particle is moving, its lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

Wait, so tau_lab = gamma * ħ/(Γ).

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought tau was ħ/(Gamma), but actually, tau_lab = gamma * (ħ/(Gamma)).

So let me correct that. So tau_lab = (gamma) * (ħ / Gamma).

So in this case, gamma is 6.6667, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_lab = (6.6667) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Then multiply by gamma 6.6667:

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 6.6667 *2.056875.

Hmm, 6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125. 0.6667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125. So total is about 13.7125.

Wait, wait, more accurately: 2.056875 *6.6667.

Let me compute 2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.6667 ≈ 2.056875 * (2/3) ≈ 1.37125.

So total is 12.34125 +1.37125 =13.7125.

So tau_lab =13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait, no: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6.6667 * 2.056875) * 1e-24.

Which gives approximately 13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So now the lifetime is 1.37125e-23 s.

Now, velocity is 2.966e8 m/s as before.

So L = v * tau_lab = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute 2.966e8 *1.37125e-23 = (2.966 *1.37125) * 1e(8-23) → 4.065 * 1e-15 → 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, that's option B (4.0655e-15 m) or option C (5.0223e-15 m). Let me compute 2.966 *1.37125.

2.966 *1.37125: Let's compute this accurately.

1.37125 *2 = 2.7425.

1.37125 *0.966 = let's compute 0.9 *1.37125=1.234125, 0.066 *1.37125≈0.0905125. Sum: 1.234125 + 0.0905125=1.3246375.

So 2.7425 + 1.3246375 =4.0671375.

So 4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the mean decay distance should be approximately 4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Why did I have to multiply by gamma again? Because the decay width Γ is the same in all frames? Or is it the case that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer?

I think the correct approach is that the total decay width Γ is the same in all frames, but the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Γ). So in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0. So that's why I multiplied by gamma again. So my second calculation is correct, leading to option B.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option B:4.0655 * 10^-15 m.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by calculating its lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) in the lab frame. The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and the reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). The proper lifetime in the rest frame is:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \, \text{s} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

In the lab frame, the lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), which is calculated using the energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

Thus, the lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( v \) of the meson. Using the relation \( \beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we find:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{8}{1.2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 \approx 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) is then given by:

\[
L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \, \text{m}.
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
L \approx (2.9661 \times 1.37125) \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches option **B**. Therefore, the mean decay distance of the meson \( X \) is:

**Answer: B**
