Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. We need to find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle θ=30 degrees and the form of the power function f(λ, θ).

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The distribution here is spheroidal, so probably it's symmetric in a certain way. Since it's along the z-axis, I'm guessing the radiation pattern might have some variation with the angle θ from the z-axis.

The radiation zone is where the fields are radiated, not just near the source. In this region, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ. The maximum power is A, and we need the fraction at θ=30 degrees.

I think about the dipole radiation. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is such that the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle θ. The maximum power is at the equator, if I'm not mistaken. So for a dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to sin²θ. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the intensity (power per unit area) in dipole radiation is proportional to (sin²θ)/ (something). Or was it (sin^2 θ) times something else?

Wait, no. Wait. The power radiated in a particular direction for a dipole is given by the radiation intensity. The formula I think is I = (p² ω^4 sin²θ) / (something with c and constants). So the maximum occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ=1. So the maximum is when θ is 90 degrees. 

But wait, in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. Hmm, maybe it's a dipole-like radiation but with a different angular dependence. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadrupole or something else. Wait, but the problem says it's oscillating, so perhaps it's an oscillating dipole.

Wait, but the shape is spheroidal. So maybe it's a dipole aligned along the z-axis, so the radiation pattern would be symmetric around that axis. The maximum emission would be perpendicular to it, like θ=90 degrees. So for θ=30 degrees, which is closer to the axis, the intensity would be lower.

Wait, the question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees." So if A is the maximum, then the fraction would be the value of f divided by A, evaluated at θ=30.

In dipole radiation, the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum occurs at θ=90°, where sinθ=1. So for any other θ, the intensity is (sinθ)^2 times the maximum. So the fraction would be (sin30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. The power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). So the maximum power is A, which would be the maximum value of f. So f_max = A. The value of f at θ=30 is A*(sin30)^2. So the fraction is (A*(sin30)^2)/A = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4.

Now, the second part is the possible form of f. So what's f as a function of λ and θ?

In radiation from a dipole, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (1/λ^4) because intensity is power per area, and power for dipole radiation goes as λ^-6 (since power is energy per time, and energy for dipole radiation scales as (1/λ^6)), but wait I might be mixing up the dependencies.

Wait, dipole radiation: the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is P = ( ( (e^2 a^2 ω^4) ) / (6 π ε0 c^3) ), where a is the amplitude. So power is proportional to ω^4, and since ω = c/λ, ω^4 = (c^4)/(λ^4). So P is proportional to 1/λ^4. Hmm? Wait, maybe not. Because if ω = 2πf, then ω^4 is (2πf)^4. But f is related to λ by c = λ f, so f = c/λ. So ω^4 = (2π c/λ)^4 = (2π c)^4 / λ^4. So power P is proportional to ω^4, which is proportional to 1/λ^4.

Wait, but wait, the power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be P/(4π), but in the case of dipole, the intensity is I = (p^2 ω^4 sin^2θ)/( 12 π ε0 c^3 ), where p is the dipole moment. So I is proportional to ω^4 sin^2θ. So substituting ω = c/λ, we get I proportional to (1/λ^4) sin^2θ. So f(λ,θ) is proportional to 1/λ^4 multiplied by sin^2θ.

Wait, but the question says f is a function of lambda and theta, and asks for the possible form of f. So f is proportional to (1/λ^4) multiplied by sin^2θ. So the form would be f ~ (sinθ)^2 / λ^4.

Looking at the options:

Options are given for the form of f. Let me check the options:

Option A: 1/2, λ^-4
Option B: 1/4, λ^-3
Option C: 1/4, λ^-4
Option D: 3/4, λ^-6

So for the form, I think it's λ^-4 with a sin^2θ dependence, so the form is λ^-4. So the function f is proportional to λ^-4.

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4. So looking at the options, option C says 1/4 and λ^-4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the fraction.

Wait, in dipole radiation, the intensity is maximum at θ=90°, which gives sin²θ = 1. So at θ=30°, sin²θ=0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, so 1/4.

Therefore, the answer should have fraction 1/4 and form λ^-4, which is option C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle θ (measured from the z-axis) and the wavelength λ. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° and the possible form of the radiated power function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

The power radiated per unit solid angle, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta / \lambda^4 \). This dependence arises because the radiation power scales as \( 1/\lambda^4 \), and the angular dependence is \( \sin^2\theta \). Therefore, the form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

From the given options:
- Option A: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) (incorrect fraction)
- Option B: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) (incorrect form)
- Option C: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) (correct)
- Option D: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) (incorrect fraction and form)

The correct answer is \( 1/4 \) for the fraction and \( \lambda^{-4} \) for the form, which corresponds to **Option C**.
