Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature of the star. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. Oh wait, when they say "excited", I think they're referring to the population of a particular energy level. So if they're twice as excited, maybe that means the number of atoms in that higher energy level is higher.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think that's the delta E for the transition between two energy levels. Oh, right, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the energy difference is E_upper - E_lower = delta E. So, the ratio would be n_upper / n_lower = exp( - delta E / (k*T) ). But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's about the excitation being twice as high. So maybe the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower for star_1 and n2_upper / n2_lower for star_2. The problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, actually, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So let me think. Maybe it's the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state. For star_1, let's say that the ratio is 2 times the ratio in star_2. So, (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But according to Boltzmann distribution, each star's ratio is determined by their own temperature. So for star_1, the ratio is exp( - delta E/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's exp( - delta E/(k T2) ). So:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio for star_1 is (n1_upper/n1_lower) = exp( - delta E/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's (n2_upper/n2_lower) = exp( - delta E/(k T2) ). The problem states that star_1's ratio is twice as much as star_2's ratio. So:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Is that the correct setup?

Wait, wait. No, maybe I have that backwards. Because higher temperature would lead to more excitation. So if star_1 is hotter, then its ratio would be higher. So if star_1's ratio is higher (twice as much as star_2's), then T1 would be higher than T2.

Let me write the equation again. Let me denote R1 as the ratio for star_1, and R2 as the ratio for star_2. The problem says R1 = 2 R2.

Using the Boltzmann equation:

R1 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2 => exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

But wait, I can take the natural log of both sides to get rid of the exponents.

ln(R1) = ln(2) + ln(R2)
=> ln(R1) - ln(R2) = ln(2)
=> ln(R1 / R2) = ln(2)
So R1/R2 = 2, which matches the problem statement.

But let's substitute R1 and R2:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) / exp( - delta E/(k T2) ) ) = 2

Which simplifies to exp( [ - delta E/(k T1) + delta E/(k T2) ] ) = 2.

Factor delta E/(k):

exp( delta E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2.

Taking natural logs on both sides:

delta E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Let me rewrite that: (delta E)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check: yes, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(delta E)/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question is about the equation for the temperatures. The options involve ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

So let's rearrange the equation.

We have:

ln(2) = [ (delta E) (T1 - T2) ) ] / [ k T1 T2 ]

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this exact form. Let's see the options.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)
Option A is ln(2) = T2 / T1
Others don't look like it.

Wait, but in our equation, the numerator is delta E multiplied by (T1-T2), and denominator is k T1 T2. So the equation is:

ln(2) = [ (delta E) (T1 - T2) ] / (k T1 T2 )

But in the options, the left side is ln(2) equals something. Let's see if any of the options can be manipulated into this form.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the energy difference delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but in the options, I don't see any constants like k, which is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's interestingâ€”the delta E is 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E = k.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which equals k * 1 K. So delta E = k * T, where T is 1 K? Hmm, but in that case, perhaps delta E is equal to k times some T? Let me see.

Wait, delta E is 1.38e-23 J equals k (1.38e-23 J/K) multiplied by 1 K, so delta E = k * 1 K.

So, delta E = k * 1 K.

Wait, that's convenient. So in our earlier equation:

ln(2) = [ (delta E) (T1 - T2) ) ] / [ k T1 T2 ]

Substituting delta E = k * 1 K:

ln(2) = [ k * 1 K * (T1 - T2) ) ] / [ k T1 T2 ]

The k cancels out:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So that would be the correct equation.

Wait, but let me double-check. I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Original setup: R1 = 2 R2. R1 is n_upper/n_lower for star_1. So according to Boltzmann:

R1 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) )

R2 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2 implies:

exp( -delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

Then, as before, taking logs:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) - delta E/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

delta E/(k T1) = - ln(2) + delta E/(k T2)

Bring terms involving delta E to one side:

delta E/(k T1) - delta E/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor delta E/(k):

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] = - ln(2)

But 1/T1 - 1/T2 is (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2), so:

delta E/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

delta E/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = [ delta E (T1 - T2) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Earlier, since delta E = k * 1 K,

ln(2) = (k*1 K (T1-T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

So the correct equation is option D.

To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we analyze the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres using the Boltzmann distribution. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). 

The Boltzmann distribution relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature of the star. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2R_2 \). Substituting these expressions into the equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = -\ln(2).
\]

Simplify \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \) to \( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} \), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Multiply through by \( -1 \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substitute \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\frac{k \cdot 1}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
