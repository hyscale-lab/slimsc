Okay, so I've got this electromagnetism problem in front of me. It's about the potentials created by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives me a scenario where a charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a point r at time t, where t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me recall the formulas for these potentials.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is given by the same formula as the static case, but modified by any time delays or motion. Or maybe not. For a static charge, V is q/(4πε0 r), but when the charge is moving, how does that change?

Oh right, in the case of a moving charge, the potentials can be affected by the velocity. But wait, the scalar potential usually depends on the charge's position, not its velocity. The vector potential, on the other hand, does depend on the motion because the magnetic field is related to the current (which involves velocity).

Wait, but wait. The potentials are determined by retarded times. Since the fields at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. So the potentials should depend on the charge's state at tr.

Now, for the scalar potential V, I think it's still the Coulomb potential but evaluated at the retarded position. But wait, does motion affect V? Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me think. The scalar potential V(r, t) is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r - vt)] where vt is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, but that's maybe not the case. Or wait, no, the exact form might involve the distance at the retarded time.

Alternatively, I think the scalar potential is given by V = q/(4πε0) * [1/(d)], where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the point r. Wait, no, because the charge is moving, so the actual distance at time t is different. Oh wait, but since t > tr, the charge has moved, but the field at r is caused by the charge's state at tr, so the distance d is from the charge's position at tr to r. So V is q/(4πε0 d), where d is |r - s(tr)|. So that's the scalar potential.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option A has V as q/(4πε0 r). Hmm, but r is probably the distance at the current time, not the retarded time. So that would be incorrect because the charge has moved. Unless the position at the current time is the same as the retarded position? No, the charge is moving, so that's probably not correct. So perhaps the correct V is expressed in terms of d, the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, in option C, V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)). Hmm, that looks a bit more complicated. What's that? Oh, wait, I think that's the expression when considering the Lorentz contraction or the retarded time factor.

Wait, let me try to recall the exact expressions for the retarded potentials. The scalar potential V is given by the same expression as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded position. Similarly, the vector potential A is a bit trickier.

The general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(r' - v' t')], where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time tr.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of retarded time. The retarded time tr is given by t = tr + (r - s(tr))/c, assuming the charge's velocity is v. So the time when the charge's influence reaches the point r is tr, and the charge's position is s(tr).

Wait, perhaps the potentials are given by the following expressions:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(d)], where d is the distance at the retarded time. Or is it [1/(d - v' tr)]? Hmm, no, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: the potentials for a charge in motion are given by the Lienard potentials. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε0)) [1/(d)], where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But wait, that's similar to the static case, but perhaps not exactly.

Wait, no, actually, for the scalar potential, because it's a scalar, it doesn't transform as a vector and is similar to the static case. So V(r, t) would be (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d)], where d is the distance between the charge at tr and the point r.

Wait, but wait, I think that's only true in the static case. When the charge is moving, the scalar potential might not be that simple. Or does it still hold?

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is the same as the static case evaluated at the retarded position, but the vector potential depends on the velocity. So V would be (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d)] as in option C and D, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v)). Hmm, that looks more like the denominator is (d c - (d · v)). Wait, that's because when you have to account for the time it takes for the charge's influence to reach the point. So the denominator would be the distance multiplied by c, minus the component of v in the direction of d multiplied by the time it takes.

Wait, I think the exact denominator is (r - s(tr)) · (v). Let's think. The distance from charge's position at tr (s(tr)) to r is d = r - s(tr). The time taken for the influence to reach r is tr = (|d|)/c. So, the velocity of the charge at tr is v, so the displacement during this time is v * tr = v * (|d|/c). So the actual displacement from the charge's position at tr to its position at time t is s(t) - s(tr) = v*(t - tr). So, the displacement vector is v * (t - tr) = v*(|d|/c).

Wait, so the charge's position at time t is s(tr) + v*(t - tr). So the vector from the charge at tr to the observation point r is d = r - s(tr). The vector from the charge at tr to r is d, which can be written as d = r - s(tr).

The vector from the charge at tr to the charge at time t is v*(t - tr) = v*(|d|/c).

So, the distance from the charge at time t to r would be |d - v*(|d|/c)|, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for the potentials.

Wait, but the potentials are determined by the state of the charge at tr. So for the scalar potential, it's based on the charge's position at tr, and for the vector potential, based on the velocity at tr.

Wait, so the scalar potential V(r, t) is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/|d|] = q/(4πε0 d). But none of the options have d in the denominator except options C and D, which have denominators that are combinations of terms involving d and v.

Wait, but options C and D have denominators (d c - d · v). Hmm, that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact expression for the scalar potential. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d - (v * tr))], but I might be mixing up terms.

Alternatively, I think the correct expression for V is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d)], because the scalar potential depends only on the position of the charge when the field is emitted, which is at time tr. So that would give V as q/(4πε0 d). But looking at the options, option C and D have V as (qc)/(something), while A and B have (q)/(4πε0 r), which seems incorrect because r is the current position, not the retarded position.

Wait, so the correct V would be the static potential evaluated at the retarded position, so the denominator is d, the distance between the charge at tr and r. So V is q/(4πε0 d). But in the options, the denominators are expressions involving d and v. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ0 q)/(4π) * [v/(c² d)] at the retarded time. Because the vector potential depends on the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the formula I remember is A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c² d), where d is the distance. So in terms of the options, that would match option B or C. Let's look:

Option B: A = (v/c²) V. Since V is q/(4πε0 r), then A would be (v/c²) * (q/(4πε0 r)).

But substituting ε0 and μ0's relation, since 1/(μ0 ε0) = c², so 1/(4πε0) = (μ0 c²)/(4π). So, let's compute option B's A.

Option B: A = (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε0 r)).

Expressed in terms of μ0:

A = (v/(c²)) * [ q/(4π ε0 r) ] = [v/(c²)] * [ (q μ0 c²)/(4π) * (1/r) ) ].

Wait, because 1/(4π ε0) = μ0 c²/(4π). So substituting, A becomes [v/(c²)] * [ (q μ0 c²)/(4π r) ) ] = [v μ0 q]/(4π r).

Wait, but the vector potential formula for a moving charge is A = (μ0 q)/(4π c² d) * v.

So, in the denominator, d is |d|, but in the options, the denominators are expressions involving d and v. Hmm.

Wait, but in option C, the vector potential A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Wait, let me think again. The correct vector potential for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * (v)/(d) * (1 - (v·d)/(c²)) )^{-1} } ?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the general expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * (v/(d)) * [1/(1 - (v·d)/(c² d))] )

Wait, but that might be getting into more complicated terms. Alternatively, I think the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), considering the Lorentz factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the exact expressions.

Another approach: The scalar potential is V = (q/(4π ε0)) * [1/(d)], where d is |r - s(tr)|. The vector potential A is (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * [v/(d - (v tr))] evaluated at the retarded time.

Wait, but how does the denominator look? Let's think in terms of the components. The denominator would be the distance at the retarded time. Alternatively, perhaps d is the vector from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). The time taken for the field to reach r is tr = (d · n)/c, where n is the unit vector in the direction of d. So, the velocity component along d is v·n. So, the displacement during tr is v * tr = (v · n) * (d · n)/(c) ) = (v · d) / c * (d / |d| ). Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the potentials involves (d c - v · d), but I'm not certain. Let me think of the terms:

The denominator would be d c - (v · d), because when you have terms involving the position and velocity, the denominator might be d multiplied by c minus the dot product of v and d.

Wait, maybe that's where the option C and D denominators come from. So, V would be (q c)/(4π ε0 (d c - v · d)), and A would be (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - v · d)).

Let me check the dimensions. The denominator in V must have dimensions of length. d is a vector, so d c would have dimensions of length × velocity = length² / time. v · d is (velocity × length), which is also length² / time. So (d c - v · d) would be length²/time. Hmm, but the denominator in V is in 1/length, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), which has the same units as (d c) because v·d is (m/s * m) = m²/s, and d c has (m * m/s) = m²/s. So the units match. So the denominator would be in (m²/s), so the entire term would be in 1/(m²/s) ) = s/m.

Wait, but the numerator in option C is qc, which has units (C * m/s). So (C m/s) / (s/m) ) = C m²/s². The units for V are volts, which is J/C = (N m)/C. Let me see: 1 V is kg m²/(s³ C). So let's check the units for option C's V:

(q c) / (d c - v · d) → (C (m/s)) / ( m²/s ) ) → (C m/s) * (s/m²) ) → C/(m). Since 1/(4π ε0) has units (N m²/C²) = (kg m³/(C² s²)). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the unit analysis. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the correct expressions.

Another thought: The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by V = (q)/(4π ε0) * [1/(d - v tr)], where tr is the retarded time. Since tr = d/(c), substituting gives V = q/(4π ε0) * 1/(d - v d/c). So this becomes  V = q/(4π ε0) * [c/(c d - v d)] = q c / [4π ε0 d (c - v)].

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, if I factor d out, it's V = (q c)/(4π ε0 d (c - v·d/d)), assuming v is in the direction of d. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is d (c - (v · d)/d ). Which would be d c - v · d.

So, V = q/(4 π ε0) * [1/(d (1 - (v · d)/(c d)) ) ) ] → q/(4π ε0) * [1/(d - (v · d)/c ) ] → which can be written as q c / [4 π ε0 (c d - v · d) ].

That's interesting. So V would be (q c) / [4 π ε0 (c d - v · d) ].

Looking back at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v)). So that's the same as what I derived here.

So V is (qc)/(4 π ε0 (d c - d · v)), which matches option C. Then, what about the vector potential A?

The vector potential A is given by (μ0 q)/(4 π c²) * [v/(d - (v tr)) ].

So substituting tr = |d| / c, but wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d), same as in V's denominator. So, A would be (μ0 q)/(4 π c²) * [v/(d c - (v · d)/c ) ].

Wait, but that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ0 q v)/(4 π (d c - v · d) ) * (1/c²) ? Or wait, let me think.

The formula I've seen for the vector potential is A = (μ0 q)/(4 π c² d) * v (1/(1 - (v·d)/(c² d)) ) ), but perhaps when d is the vector, the denominator becomes (d c - v · d)/c.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for A is (μ0 q v)/(4 π (d c - v·d) ), because when you have d c - v·d = c (d - (v tr)) · something.

Looking at option C, the vector potential is (μ0 q c v) / [4 π (d c - v·d) ].

Wait, let me compute the units. The numerator: μ0 (H/m) * q (C) * c (m/s) * v (m/s) → H * C * m²/s².

Wait, H is Ω·m = (V s)/(A m) → (kg·m²)/(s³·A·m) ) → kg·m/(s³·A).

So μ0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²).

So μ0 * q * c * v → kg·m/(s² A²) ) * C * m/s * m/s → kg m/(s² A²) * (C m²/s²) → kg m^3/(s^4 A²) C.

Denominator: (d c - v·d) → m²/s.

So overall, the units for A would be [ kg m^3/(s^4 A² C) ) ] / [ m²/s ] → kg m/(s^3 A² C) )

But A has units of Tesla·m², and Tesla is kg/(s² A), so Tesla·m² is kg m²/(s² A), which would match if the units here are kg m/(s^3 A² C) → Not sure. Maybe unit analysis isn't the way to go.

But according to the earlier analysis, option C seems to have the correct form for both V and A. Because V is (qc)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v)), and A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) due to a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The scalar potential \( V \) depends on the charge's position at \( t_r \), while the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) depends on the charge's velocity at \( t_r \). The potentials are influenced by the geometry of the problem, involving the vector \( \vec{d} \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a static charge is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the observation point. For a moving charge, the scalar potential is modified to account for the retarded time \( t_r \). The denominator involves the term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \), to account for the relativistic effects of the charge's motion.
   - This matches the form of \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), as seen in **Option C**.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time. The denominator also involves \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), consistent with the scalar potential's denominator, to ensure relativistic consistency.
   - This matches the form of \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), as seen in **Option C**.

3. **Elimination of Other Options:**
   - **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly assume the potentials are independent of the charge's velocity or do not properly account for the retarded time effects.
   - **Option D** has incorrect prefactors and does not match the standard form of the potentials for a moving charge.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, where both \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) are consistent with the retarded time formalism and relativistic effects.

Or wait, no, the exact form might involve the distance at the retarded time.

Alternatively, I think the scalar potential is given by V = q/(4πε0) * [1/(d)], where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the point r. Wait, no, because the charge is moving, so the actual distance at time t is different. Oh wait, but since t > tr, the charge has moved, but the field at r is caused by the charge's state at tr, so the distance d is from the charge's position at tr to r. So V is q/(4πε0 d), where d is |r - s(tr)|. So that's the scalar potential.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option A has V as q/(4πε0 r). Hmm, but r is probably the distance at the current time, not the retarded time. So that would be incorrect because the charge has moved. Unless the position at the current time is the same as the retarded position? No, the charge is moving, so that's probably not correct. So perhaps the correct V is expressed in terms of d, the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, in option C, V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)). Hmm, that looks a bit more complicated. What's that? Oh, wait, I think that's the expression when considering the Lorentz contraction or the retarded time factor.

Wait, let me try to recall the exact expressions for the retarded potentials. The scalar potential V is given by the same expression as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded position. Similarly, the vector potential A is a bit trickier.

The general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(r' - v' t')], where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time tr.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of retarded time. The retarded time tr is given by t = tr + (r - s(tr))/c, assuming the charge's velocity is v. So the time when the charge's influence reaches the point r is tr, and the charge's position is s(tr).

Wait, perhaps the potentials are given by the following expressions:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(d)], where d is the distance at the retarded time. Or is it [1/(d - v' tr)]? Hmm, no, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: the potentials for a charge in motion are given by the Lienard potentials. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε0)) [1/(d)], where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But wait, that's similar to the static case, but perhaps not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is the same as the static case evaluated at the retarded position, but the vector potential depends on the velocity. So V would be (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d)] as in option C and D, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v)). Hmm, that looks more like the denominator is (d c - (d · v)). Wait, that's because when you have to account for the time it takes for the charge's influence to reach the point. So the denominator would be the distance multiplied by c, minus the component of v in the direction of d multiplied by the time it takes.

Wait, I think the exact denominator is (r - s(tr)) · (v). Let's think. The distance from charge's position at tr (s(tr)) to r is d = r - s(tr). The time taken for the influence to reach r is tr = (|d|)/c. So, the velocity of the charge at tr is v, so the displacement during this time is v * tr = v * (|d|/c). So the actual displacement from the charge's position at tr to its position at time t is s(t) - s(tr) = v*(t - tr). So, the displacement vector is v * (t - tr) = v*(|d|/c).

Wait, so the charge's position at time t is s(tr) + v*(t - tr). So the vector from the charge at tr to the observation point r is d = r - s(tr). The vector from the charge at tr to r is d, which can be written as d = r - s(tr).

The vector from the charge at tr to the charge at time t is v*(t - tr) = v*(|d|/c).

So, the distance from the charge at time t to r would be |d - v*(|d|/c)|, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for the potentials.

Wait, but the potentials are determined by the state of the charge at tr. So for the scalar potential, it's based on the charge's position at tr, and for the vector potential, based on the velocity at tr.

Wait, so the scalar potential V(r, t) is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/|d|] = q/(4πε0 d). But none of the options have d in the denominator except options C and D, which have denominators that are combinations of terms involving d and v.

Wait, but options C and D have denominators (d c - d · v). Hmm, that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact expression for the scalar potential. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d - (v * tr))], but I might be mixing up terms.

Alternatively, I think the correct expression for V is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d)], because the scalar potential depends only on the position of the charge when the field is emitted, which is at time tr. So that would give V as q/(4πε0 d). But looking at the options, option C and D have V as (qc)/(something), while A and B have (q)/(4πε0 r), which seems incorrect because r is the current position, not the retarded position.

Wait, so the correct V would be the static potential evaluated at the retarded position, so the denominator is d, the distance between the charge at tr and r. So V is q/(4πε0 d). But in the options, the denominators are expressions involving d and v. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ0 q)/(4π) * [v/(c² d)] at the retarded time. Because the vector potential depends on the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the formula I remember is A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c² d), where d is the distance. So in terms of the options, that would match option B or C. Let's look:

Option B: A = (v/c²) V. Since V is q/(4πε0 r), then A would be (v/c²) * (q/(4πε0 r)).

But substituting ε0 and μ0's relation, since 1/(μ0 ε0) = c², so 1/(4πε0) = (μ0 c²)/(4π). So, let's compute option B's A.

Option B: A = (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε0 r)).

Expressed in terms of μ0:

A = (v/(c²)) * [ q/(4π ε0 r) ] = [v/(c²)] * [ (q μ0 c²)/(4π) * (1/r) ) ].

Wait, because 1/(4π ε0) = μ0 c²/(4π). So substituting, A becomes [v/(c²)] * [ (q μ0 c²)/(4π r) ) ] = [v μ0 q]/(4π r).

Wait, but the vector potential formula for a moving charge is A = (μ0 q)/(4π c² d) * v.

So, in the denominator, d is |d|, but in the options, the denominators are expressions involving d and v. Hmm.

Wait, but in option C, the vector potential A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Wait, let me think again. The correct vector potential for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * (v)/(d) * (1 - (v·d)/(c²)) )^{-1} } ?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the general expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * (v/(d)) * [1/(1 - (v·d)/(c² d))] )

Wait, but that might be getting into more complicated terms. Alternatively, I think the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), considering the Lorentz factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the exact expressions.

Another approach: The scalar potential is V = (q/(4π ε0)) * [1/(d)], where d is |r - s(tr)|. The vector potential A is (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * [v/(d - (v tr))] evaluated at the retarded time.

Wait, but how does the denominator look? Let's think in terms of the components. The denominator would be the distance at the retarded time. Alternatively, perhaps d is the vector from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). The time taken for the field to reach r is tr = (d · n)/c, where n is the unit vector in the direction of d. So, the velocity component along d is v·n. So, the displacement during tr is v * tr = (v · n) * (d · n)/(c) ) = (v · d) / c * (d / |d| ). Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the potentials involves (d c - v · d), but I'm not certain. Let me think of the terms:

The denominator would be d c - (v · d), because when you have terms involving the position and velocity, the denominator might be d multiplied by c minus the dot product of v and d.

Wait, maybe that's where the option C and D denominators come from. So, V would be (q c)/(4π ε0 (d c - v · d)), and A would be (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - v · d)).

Let me check the dimensions. The denominator in V must have dimensions of length. d is a vector, so d c would have dimensions of length × velocity = length² / time. v · d is (velocity × length), which is also length² / time. So (d c - v · d) would be length²/time. Hmm, but the denominator in V is in 1/length, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), which has the same units as (d c) because v·d is (m/s * m) = m²/s, and d c has (m * m/s) = m²/s. So the units match. So the denominator would be in (m²/s), so the entire term would be in 1/(m²/s) ) = s/m.

Wait, but the numerator in option C is qc, which has units (C * m/s). So (C m/s) / (s/m) ) = C m²/s². The units for V are volts, which is J/C = (N m)/C. Let me see: 1 V is kg m²/(s³ C). So let's check the units for option C's V:

(q c) / (d c - v · d) → (C (m/s)) / ( m²/s ) ) → (C m/s) * (s/m²) ) → C/(m). Since 1/(4π ε0) has units (N m²/C²) = (kg m³/(C² s²)). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the unit analysis. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the correct expressions.

Another thought: The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by V = (q)/(4π ε0) * [1/(d - v tr)], where tr is the retarded time. Since tr = d/(c), substituting gives V = q/(4π ε0) * 1/(d - v d/c). So this becomes  V = q/(4π ε0) * [c/(c d - v d)] = q c / [4π ε0 d (c - v)].

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, if I factor d out, it's V = (q c)/(4π ε0 d (c - v·d/d)), assuming v is in the direction of d. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is d (c - (v · d)/d ). Which would be d c - v · d.

So, V = q/(4 π ε0) * [1/(d (1 - (v · d)/(c d)) ) ) ] → q/(4π ε0) * [1/(d - (v · d)/c ) ] → which can be written as q c / [4 π ε0 (c d - v · d) ].

That's interesting. So V would be (q c) / [4 π ε0 (c d - v · d) ].

Looking back at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v)). So that's the same as what I derived here.

So V is (qc)/(4 π ε0 (d c - d · v)), which matches option C. Then, what about the vector potential A?

The vector potential A is given by (μ0 q)/(4 π c²) * [v/(d - (v tr)) ].

So substituting tr = |d| / c, but wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d), same as in V's denominator. So, A would be (μ0 q)/(4 π c²) * [v/(d c - (v · d)/c ) ].

Wait, but that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ0 q v)/(4 π (d c - v · d) ) * (1/c²) ? Or wait, let me think.

The formula I've seen for the vector potential is A = (μ0 q)/(4 π c² d) * v (1/(1 - (v·d)/(c² d)) ) ), but perhaps when d is the vector, the denominator becomes (d c - v · d)/c.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for A is (μ0 q v)/(4 π (d c - v·d) ), because when you have d c - v·d = c (d - (v tr)) · something.

Looking at option C, the vector potential is (μ0 q c v) / [4 π (d c - v·d) ].

Wait, let me compute the units. The numerator: μ0 (H/m) * q (C) * c (m/s) * v (m/s) → H * C * m²/s².

Wait, H is Ω·m = (V s)/(A m) → (kg·m²)/(s³·A·m) ) → kg·m/(s³·A).

So μ0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²).

So μ0 * q * c * v → kg·m/(s² A²) ) * C * m/s * m/s → kg m/(s² A²) * (C m²/s²) → kg m^3/(s^4 A²) C.

Denominator: (d c - v·d) → m²/s.

So overall, the units for A would be [ kg m^3/(s^4 A² C) ) ] / [ m²/s ] → kg m/(s^3 A² C) )

But A has units of Tesla·m², and Tesla is kg/(s² A), so Tesla·m² is kg m²/(s² A), which would match if the units here are kg m/(s^3 A² C) → Not sure. Maybe unit analysis isn't the way to go.

But according to the earlier analysis, option C seems to have the correct form for both V and A. Because V is (qc)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v)), and A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) due to a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The scalar potential \( V \) depends on the charge's position at \( t_r \), while the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) depends on the charge's velocity at \( t_r \). The potentials are influenced by the geometry of the problem, involving the vector \( \vec{d} \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a static charge is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the observation point. For a moving charge, the scalar potential is modified to account for the retarded time \( t_r \). The denominator involves the term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \), to account for the relativistic effects of the charge's motion.
   - This matches the form of \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), as seen in **Option C**.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time. The denominator also involves \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), consistent with the scalar potential's denominator, to ensure relativistic consistency.
   - This matches the form of \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), as seen in **Option C**.

3. **Elimination of Other Options:**
   - **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly assume the potentials are independent of the charge's velocity or do not properly account for the retarded time effects.
   - **Option D** has incorrect prefactors and does not match the standard form of the potentials for a moving charge.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, where both \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) are consistent with the retarded time formalism and relativistic effects.
