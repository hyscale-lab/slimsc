Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then I'll match them with the options provided to find the correct answer.

First, I'll go through each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) is a strong base, often used as a catalyst in such reactions. These conditions probably deprotonate the alpha hydrogen to form an enolate, which is a nucleophile.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When the base deprotonates it, the enolate would be at the beta position. So the enolate would attack the beta position of the other molecule, which is the acrylate.

Wait, the other molecule is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me, but in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So maybe it's something like CH2CH2 but with substituents. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOMe. But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would mean that the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Or is it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? Hmm, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-Me? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as in the structure CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)CO2Me? No, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps it's arranged as CH2=CH-CO-O-Me with a p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Wait, maybe it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, that doesn't seem correct either. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? No, because that would be styryl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CO2Me, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate being CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)CO2Me, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate. Wait, prop-2-enoate would be CH2=CHCO-O-Me. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl is on the third carbon, but in prop-2-enoate, only three carbons. Oh, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? That can't be right because that would make it an allyl group. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Michael acceptor. The acrylate is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the carbon chain would be something like CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached at the 3-position. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because the acrylate is RCOOCH3. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? But that would have four carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)CO2Me. But wait, that would make the structure CH2-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, that would be prop-2-enoate with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should proceed.

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, the addition would occur. So the enolate would attack the gamma carbon of the acrylate, which is the position next to the carbonyl. Wait, no, in Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor). So for an acceptor like CH2=CHCOOCH3, the enolate would attack the CH2 part, the beta carbon, adding across the double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is like RCOCH2CH2COOR, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the mechanism. In the Michael addition, the enolate (from the donor) attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (acceptor) at the beta position. So the enolate would add to the beta carbon of the acceptor.

So, in Reaction A, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure of the acceptor is perhaps CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, I'm probably getting it wrong, but perhaps I can proceed.

Once the attack happens, the enolate adds to the acceptor, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would then undergo an elimination step, perhaps, but in the case of a Michael addition, it should form a substituted product.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid. So when the enolate forms (after deprotonation), it would attack the acceptor. Let's imagine that the enolate of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)C-: the deprotonated alpha carbon (the middle CH2 becomes CH-).

Wait, no, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So when the base deprotonates it, the enolate would be CH2(COOCH3)-C-CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as two acetate groups on a central CH2 group. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would be [CH(COOCH3)2]^- and the sodium would be the counterion.

So the enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor. Let's say the acceptor is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 (methyl acrylate). Then, the enolate would attack the CH2 part, adding across the double bond. The product would be CH2(COOCH3)2-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the product would be a conjugate addition, so the enolate adds to the beta carbon, leading to a new carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the product would have the two malonate groups attached to the new carbon. So for the first part, when the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the acceptor, the product would be a new molecule where the two malonate groups are added to the acceptor's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be something like trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That's one of the options. Let me see: the formula would be O=C(OCH3)-C(CO2Me)2-CH2-p-tolyl? Or perhaps more accurately, the product would have three ester groups attached to the central carbon.

Wait, wait: when the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is a diester) attacks the acceptor, the acceptor's structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which I'm now thinking is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps I should look for the product formula in the options.

Looking at the options, option A for Reaction A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So the formula would be O=C(OCH3)2C(CO2Me)2-CH2-p-tolyl? Or perhaps the structure is:

The product would have the dimethyl malonate groups attached to the acceptor. So when the enolate attacks, the two COOCH3 groups from malonate attach to the same carbon as the p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate, with three ester groups. So, the product would have the structure where the central carbon is connected to three COOCH3 groups and a p-tolyl group. So that would be (trimethyl) 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

So for Reaction A, the product A would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Now moving on to Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, the conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic. So perhaps this is a Michael addition where the enamine or an enol is formed. Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine with a cyclohexenyl group attached. So it's a bicyclic structure. The cyclohexenyl group is a conjugated double bond, which can form an enamine or enolate under certain conditions.

But wait, the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexenyl group at position 1. So the structure is a piperidine ring connected to a cyclohexene ring, with the double bond between C1 and C2 of the cyclohexene.

Now, the reaction is with (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The structure of but-2-enenitrile is NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Hmm, no, wait. But-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH2-CN, with the double bond between C1 and C2. Structure: CH2=CH-CN.

Wait, no. Let me think. But-2-enenitrile is H2C=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2 with the nitrile group. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH-CN. Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong. No, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN? Hmm, but wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH2-CN where the double bond is between C2 and C3? Or maybe between C1 and C2.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH3CH2CH=CHCN? No, that would be longer. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CN. Hmm, but but-2-enenitrile would have four carbons, with the double bond starting at C2, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH3CH=CHCN. Because but-2-ene is CH2CHCH2CH3, but with the nitrile group on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(CN)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN? Or is it CH2=CH-CH2-CN? Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CN.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps that's not the most important part right now. The reaction is a Michael addition, so I need to determine which is the donor and which is the acceptor.

In this case, the piperidine derivative (1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine) is likely to act as the nucleophile, and (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor because it's alpha,beta-unsaturated. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (acceptor). But in this case, the acceptor is a nitrile, which is also an alpha,beta-unsaturated system.

Wait, but nitriles can act as Michael acceptors because the alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile is an electron-deficient species. So the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, and the piperidine derivative would act as the donor by forming an enamine or enolate.

Wait, but the piperidine is attached to a cyclohexene ring. The cyclohex-1-en-1-yl group is a conjugated system, which can form an enamine. So under acidic conditions (H3O+), the piperidine might form an enamine, which is a nucleophile.

Wait, in acidic conditions, the amine (piperidine) can protonate, but that's not always the case. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexenyl group can undergo some conjugation to form an enamine. Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine: the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen. So the structure is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene group attached to the nitrogen. 

In such a structure, the cyclohexene can act as a conjugated system, similar to an enamine. So under acidic conditions, perhaps the piperidine's lone pair can help form a conjugated system, making the adjacent carbon (the cyclohexene's C2) more nucleophilic.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, the amine would typically get protonated, making it less nucleophilic. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene part is what's involved in the conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene part can form an enamine-like structure, making the adjacent carbon nucleophilic. So the enamine would attack the Michael acceptor (the but-2-enenitrile).

So the enamine from the piperidine-cyclohexene system would attack the beta position of the but-2-enenitrile. The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCH2CN. So the attack would occur at the gamma position (the CH2CN part?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think again. The Michael addition typically involves the enolate attacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl at the beta position. In this case, the acceptor is an alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile, which is a good Michael acceptor. So the enamine (from the donor) would attack the beta carbon of the acceptor.

So the structure of but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH3-CH2-CH=CH-CN? No, that's longer, but but-2-ene is four carbons. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN, but I'm not certain.

Once the attack occurs, the enamine would add to the beta position of the nitrile, creating a new carbon-nitrogen bond. The product would have the cyclohexene-piperidine group attached to the butenyl group.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product structure. For Reaction B, the product is labeled as B, and the options for B are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, looking at option B, for B, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Another option in option A is the same for B.

Wait, perhaps the product would have a butanenitrile chain with the cyclohexenyl-piperidine group attached at the 3-position. Because the attack is at the beta (second) carbon of the acceptor.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility of elimination or other reactions, but given that it's a Michael addition, the product would be the addition product.

Hmm, perhaps the product would have the cyclohexene part as a substituent on the butenyl group. So the structure would be something like CH2-CH2-C(piperidine-cyclohexene)-CH2-CN. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, 2-oxocyclohexyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 2. So the structure would be a cyclohexanone ring attached to the butanenitrile at the 3-position.

Wait, but in the reaction, the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexene. So when the enamine attacks, the cyclohexene part would form a bond with the acceptor. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene group to the butenyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the major product for Reaction B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Looking at the options, option A and B have B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Options C and D have B as 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

So if Reaction B's product is that, then options A and B are possibilities.

Now, moving on to Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, Reaction C is presented as C + but-3-en-2-one → product. The options for C are either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, cyclohexane-1,3-dione, etc.

Wait, but the actual reaction is C plus but-3-en-2-one under KOH and H2O to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the reaction's arrow is written as C + but-3-en-2-one → product. So what's C in this reaction? The options for C in the products are given as either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, cyclohexane-1,3-dione, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says, "what are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?" So Reaction C is written as C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So in this reaction, C is the nucleophile (likely a donor), and but-3-en-2-one is the acceptor.

But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C=O, which is methyl vinyl ketone. Structure: CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait. But-3-en-2-one would be CH2CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait, but the but-3-en-2-one would have four carbons, double bond at position 3, and a ketone at position 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. Wait, no: but-3-en-2-one is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH2-CO? No. Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3 with the double bond between C3 and C4? No, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So structure: CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ketone is on C2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as (E)-but-3-en-2-one: the structure would be CH2=C-CH2-CO? Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong, but perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C=O, but that's not possible. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3 with the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not correct because but can only have four carbons.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3, but that would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4, which isn't possible in a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the structure is (CH2)2C(O)CH3, which is 3-penten-2-one, but that's not butenone. Maybe I should move on.

In Reaction C, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The 2-(3-oxobutyl) group suggests that a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 is attached to the cyclohexane at position 2. So the structure would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a -(CH2)3-CO- group attached at position 2.

Wait, but wait, 2-(3-oxobutyl) would be -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane. Hmm.

The reactant here is but-3-en-2-one, which is the Michael acceptor, and C is the donor. The donor would form an enolate or enamine that attacks the acceptor.

So under KOH and H2O, which is a basic condition, the donor C would form an enolate. The product would be the addition of the enolate to the acceptor.

Given that the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the donor must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Because when the enolate from the cyclohexane dione attacks the acceptor, the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the butenone chain.

Wait, but in the reaction, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the donor must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, as its enolate would attack the acceptor. So when the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) attacks the but-3-en-2-one (acceptor), the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the butenone-derived chain.

Wait, but the product has a 3-oxobutyl group, which is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2- attached. So perhaps the enolate from the dione would attack the acceptor at the beta position, leading to the product.

So, the major product for Reaction C is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which implies that C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, looking at the options, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but in the options, for C, option B is C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options for C are:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option C: same as B, perhaps.

Wait, the options for each reaction's product are:

Option A:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile

C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option B:

A = same as A in option A

B = same as B in option A

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option C:

A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate

B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option D:

A = same as option C's A

B = same as option C's B

C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Wait, perhaps Reaction C's product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So what is the starting material C?

The starting material C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would form an enolate that attacks the acceptor but-3-en-2-one.

So in Reaction C, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Therefore, the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and option C also says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So which option has all three reactions correct?

Now, putting it all together:

Reaction A product is option A) trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Reaction B product is option B) 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Reaction C product is C) cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A is trimethyl...; B is 3-(2-oxo...); C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So the correct option would be option B.

But wait, let me check the other reactions again.

Wait, Reaction B's product was either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Earlier, I thought that under acidic conditions, the product would be the former, but perhaps under the conditions given (MeOH, H3O+), the product would be the latter.

Wait, the reaction is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H3O+ → B.

Under acidic conditions, perhaps the piperidine is protonated, making it less nucleophilic. Alternatively, the cyclohexenyl group could form an enamine under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of H3O+, would the piperidine form an enamine? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the cyclohexenyl group is acting as a nucleophile.

In any case, looking back, the options for B are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

But in the product, if the acceptor is but-2-enenitrile, the addition would form a new bond between the enamine's carbon and the acceptor's beta carbon.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, perhaps the product would have a hydroxyl group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reverse Michael addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a cyclohexenyl group attached to the butanenitrile via a single bond, as in 3-(cyclohexenyl)butanenitrile, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which would imply that the cyclohexene has become a cyclohexanone (with an oxo group) attached to the butanenitrile.

Alternatively, if the reaction forms a new ring, perhaps via cyclization, but that's not indicated.

Hmm, given the time I'm spending and to avoid getting stuck, I'll proceed with the initial assessment.

So, Reaction A's product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Reaction B's product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Reaction C's product is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A is correct, B is correct, C is correct.

Option B says:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So option B is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves three separate Michael addition reactions (A, B, and C), and the goal is to determine the correct reactants and major products for each. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Reaction A:
**Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH.  
- Dimethyl malonate acts as the Michael donor, forming an enolate upon deprotonation by NaOEt.  
- Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.  
- The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, leading to a conjugate addition.  
- The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, as the two ester groups from dimethyl malonate and the p-tolyl group combine in the product.

### Reaction B:
**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.  
- 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as the Michael donor, likely forming an enamine under acidic conditions.  
- (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.  
- The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond.  
- The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexenyl group is converted to a cyclohexanone (2-oxocyclohexyl) group attached to the butanenitrile chain.

### Reaction C:
**Reactants:** C and but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O.  
- The product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  
- The starting material C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which forms an enolate under basic conditions (KOH).  
- The enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, leading to the product where the cyclohexane-1,3-dione is attached to a 3-oxobutyl group.

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction C.  
- **Option B:** Correct because it lists:  
  - A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Reaction A),  
  - B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Reaction B),  
  - C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Reaction C).  
- **Option C:** Incorrect because it lists A and B as different products, which do not match the analysis.  
- **Option D:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is inconsistent with Reaction C.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B**, as it matches all three reactions and their respective products.  
**Answer: B**
