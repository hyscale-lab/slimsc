Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are A to D with different r vectors.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that the density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. For a qubit, the state can be represented as a vector in a 2D space, but when considering density matrices, it's more about the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, no, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. For mixed states, the density matrix is a more general concept. But how does that translate into position in the qubit space? Let me recall. Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3D vector (the Bloch vector). So if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me compute that. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write out |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| in matrix form. |0⟩ is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I.

Wait, the identity matrix is I, so ρ = I/2. Now, the general form is I/2 when r is zero. Because when r is zero, ρ = (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector r must be (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which should be the correct answer. Let me double-check. If the state is a completely mixed state, it's in the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's not pointing anywhere, so r is zero.

Wait, are there any other considerations? For example, if it's a mixed state of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities, each with 50% chance. So it's maximally mixed, so the density matrix is I/2. That's the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Yep, so r is (0,0,0), matching option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1|\right).
\]

This can be rewritten as \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \(r\) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}I\), it is evident that \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided:
- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this would represent a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not a mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \(r = (0,0,0)\).
