Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For the p orbital, l is 1, right? So each has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I thought that when you couple angular momenta, the total l is the sum of l1 and l2. Since each is 1, the maximum total l is 2, which matches the state here. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. So, each of the electrons' Lz would be -ħ, right?

Hmm. Let me recall. For a single particle, the eigenstate of Lz is |l, m>, and the eigenvalue is mħ. So for each electron, Lz eigenvalue is m_i * ħ. So for each, if we have m_i = -1, then the eigenvalue is -ħ. 

In the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what are the possible m1 and m2 values? Because the total m is m1 + m2 = -1. 

Wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> means that when you combine the two individual states, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. But each electron can have m1 and m2 values from -1 to +1.

But wait, the state given is a coupled state, so it's a specific combination of the individual states. How does that work? I think the coupled state is a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2>. 

So for two electrons in p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible total l is 0,1,2. But here, it's l=2, so the state is a part of the l=2 multiplet. The m value is -1, so the state is |2, -1>.

Wait, but what are the possible m1 and m2 values that add up to -1? Let's list all possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1.

Possible m1 and m2 can be:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1
- m1 = -2, but wait, no, since each m can only be -1, 0, +1. Oh right, so m ranges from -l to +l in integer steps. So for l=1, m can be -1,0,1.

So m1 and m2 must each be in that range. So the possible pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), and (0,0) can't because 0 + (-1) is -1, no wait, 0+ (-1) is -1. So that's another possibility. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0 + (-1) is -1. So yes, m1=0, m2=-1 gives sum -1. And m1=-1, m2=0 also. Any others?

Wait, m1 = +1 and m2 = -2? No, because m2 can't be -2. So no, only the two combinations where one is -1 and the other is 0. Wait, no, another possibility: m1 = -1, m2 =0 or m1=0, m2=-1. Because 1 + (-2) is -1, but m2 can't be -2. So only these two pairs.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me list all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1: -1, 0, 1.

So for m1=-1, m2 must be 0 (since -1 +0 =-1). 

For m1=0, m2 must be -1.

For m1=1, m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed because m2 can't be less than -1. So only two possible pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So in the coupled state |2, -1>, how is it expressed in terms of the product states |m1, m2>?

I remember that when you couple angular momenta, the states |l1, l2, L, M> are built from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For two spin-1 particles (in this case, orbital angular momentum), the state |2, -1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states that have m1 + m2 = -1. Which are the same as the two pairs we found: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the question is, what is the coefficient of each of these product states in the expansion of |2, -1>? Because the probability we're looking for is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the product states where both m1 and m2 are -1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because in the product states that contribute to |2,-1>, the m1 and m2 are either (-1,0) or (0,-1). So in neither case are both m1 and m2 equal to -1. Because in those product states, one is -1 and the other is 0. So if I'm trying to find the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ, that would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, right? Because L1z |m1> = m1ħ |m1>, so m1 = -1 gives eigenvalue -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the probability we're looking for is the probability that, when measuring both m1 and m2, each is -1. That is, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> contributes to the state |2, m_total=-1>.

Wait, but wait, in our earlier analysis, the product states that contribute to |2,-1> are those where m1 + m2 = -1. So if we have m1 = -1, m2 = 0; and m1=0, m2=-1. Neither of these have both m1 and m2 being -1. So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of the |2,-1> state.

So that means that the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> is zero in the expansion of |2,-1>. Therefore, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 to be -1 is zero.

Wait, but let me double-check. Could the state |2, -1> have any component of |m1=-1, m2=-1>? Let me think about the possible m_total.

If m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, then m_total = -2. So that state would be part of the |2, -2> state, not the |2, -1> state.

So the expansion of |2, -1> in product states would only include terms where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible product states are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |2, -1> would be a linear combination like a|m1=-1, m2=0> + b|m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but what about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients here. What are they? I think for two l=1 particles coupling to L=2, the state |2, -1> would be:

sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> - sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, not sure about the exact signs and coefficients. But regardless, the point is that the state |2,-1> doesn't have any component of |m1=-1, m2=-1>, because that product state would contribute to a m_total of -2, not -1.

So in the expansion of |2,-1>, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> doesn't appear. Thus, the amplitude for that state is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

So the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero. So the answer should be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with orbital angular momentum quantum numbers \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \).

For a single particle, the eigenvalues of \( L_{z} \) are \( m \hbar \), where \( m \) can take values \( -l, -l+1, \dots, l \). For \( l = 1 \), \( m \) can be \( -1, 0, +1 \). Thus, \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) can each have eigenvalues \( -\hbar, 0, +\hbar \). The joint measurement of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) corresponds to the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), which has \( m_{\text{total}} = m_1 + m_2 = -2 \).

The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \) where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The possible pairs \( (m_1, m_2) \) are \( (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, -1) \). The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), which would correspond to \( m_{\text{total}} = -2 \), does not contribute to \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \). Therefore, the coefficient of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the expansion of \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is zero.

Since the amplitude for \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) is zero, the probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is also zero.

Possible m1 and m2 can be:

- m1 = -2, but wait, no, since each m can only be -1, 0, +1. Oh right, so m ranges from -l to +l in integer steps. So for l=1, m can be -1,0,1.

So m1 and m2 must each be in that range. So the possible pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), and (0,0) can't because 0 + (-1) is -1, no wait, 0+ (-1) is -1. So that's another possibility. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0 + (-1) is -1. So yes, m1=0, m2=-1 gives sum -1. And m1=-1, m2=0 also. Any others?

Wait, m1 = +1 and m2 = -2? No, because m2 can't be -2. So no, only the two combinations where one is -1 and the other is 0. Wait, no, another possibility: m1 = -1, m2 =0 or m1=0, m2=-1. Because 1 + (-2) is -1, but m2 can't be -2. So only these two pairs.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me list all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1: -1, 0, 1.

So for m1=-1, m2 must be 0 (since -1 +0 =-1). 

For m1=0, m2 must be -1.

For m1=1, m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed because m2 can't be less than -1. So only two possible pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the probability we're looking for is the probability that, when measuring both m1 and m2, each is -1. That is, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> contributes to the state |2, m_total=-1>.

Wait, but wait, in our earlier analysis, the product states that contribute to |2,-1> are those where m1 + m2 = -1. So if we have m1 = -1, m2 = 0; and m1=0, m2=-1. Neither of these have both m1 and m2 being -1. So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of the |2,-1> state.
