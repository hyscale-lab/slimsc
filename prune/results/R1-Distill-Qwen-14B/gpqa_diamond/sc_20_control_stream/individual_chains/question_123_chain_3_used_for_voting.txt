Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm. Let me try to think through it.

Alright, the problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So I guess that means we can use special relativity here. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact concepts. So, an inertial frame is one that's not accelerating, right? So both are moving at constant velocities relative to each other.

The question is: From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a big speed. I remember that at such high speeds, relativistic effects might come into play. But wait, the question is about distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So if 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because they are moving relative to each other, time dilation will occur.

Wait, but distance is a tricky thing. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at that speed, so distance would be speed multiplied by time. But wait, the time we need is the time in the galaxy's frame for the same event that takes 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think step by step.

So, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v = 60,000 km/s. So in their frame, it takes t' = 50 seconds for the galaxy to move a certain distance. But we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy in the galaxy's frame. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s, and the time taken is t. But t is the time in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so perhaps we need to find t, the time in the galaxy's frame, then multiply by v to get the distance.

But how to relate t and t'?

I remember that in special relativity, the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor. So if the events are happening in different frames, the time experienced in each frame differs.

Wait, but wait, what's the direction of motion? The ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving towards them. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them. So, the relative speed is v.

So, let's think about the two frames: the galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (S').

In S', the galaxy (S) is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta. So, in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the galaxy.

So, in the problem, t' is 50 seconds. So, what is t, the time in S?

Wait, but I think I should use the Lorentz transformations here. Because the time in each frame is different. The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c² ), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of velocity and time. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, t.

So, the problem reduces to finding t, given that t' =50 s.

But how do t and t' relate? Since the two frames are moving relative to each other, time in each frame will be different.

Wait, in the rest frame of the galaxy (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at speed v. So, in S, the time taken for the ejecta to move a certain distance is t.

But in the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy is approaching at speed v. So, in S', the time taken for the galaxy to reach the ejecta (assuming they meet when the ejecta reaches the galaxy's position?) Hmm, maybe that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the supernova ejecta and the galaxy are at rest in their own frames. But I think the problem is saying that in S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy is moving towards them at v = 60,000 km/s. So, the problem is about the distance that the ejecta travels in S (galaxy's frame) when 50 seconds have passed in S'.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the proper time. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is different from the ejecta's due to time dilation.

Wait, let's calculate gamma. So v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into meters per second to be consistent with SI units.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 meters per second. Because 1 km is 1000 meters, so 60,000 km = 60,000 * 1000 meters = 6e7 meters. So 6e7 m/s.

Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v is 0.2 times c, since 6e7 is 0.2 times 3e8. That's 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects are significant but not the most extreme.

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, v = 6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

v² = (6e7)^2 = 36e14.

c² = 9e16.

So, v²/c² = 36e14 / 9e16 = (36/9) * 1e-2 = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04.

So, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is close to 0.96).

So gamma is about 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204. Wait, but wait, actually 1/sqrt(0.96) is approximately 1.0206, yeah.

But let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96):

Well, 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.

So sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5.

Sqrt(24) is about 4.89898.

So 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.9798.

So 1/sqrt(0.96) is approximately 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t'.

t' is 50 seconds.

So t ≈ 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 seconds.

So in the galaxy's frame, 51.03 seconds pass when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s.

t is approximately 51.03 seconds.

So distance d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.

Wait, 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.03 s would give 60,000 *51.03 km.

Calculating that: 60,000 *51 is 3,060,000. But since it's 51.03, it's 60,000 *51.03 = 51.03 *6e4.

Wait, 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.

Wait, 60,000 * 51.03 is 3,060,000 + (60,000 *0.03) = 3,060,000 + 1,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 60,000 *51. So perhaps we should consider that gamma is 1.0206, t is around 51.03, but perhaps the exact value is leading to 51.03, but the options are in approximate numbers.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma value.

Wait, check the exact calculation for gamma.

v = 6e7 m/s.

v²/c² = (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (36e14)/(9e16) )= 4e-2.

So, v²/c² = 0.04.

So, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Computing sqrt(0.96) exactly:

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10.

sqrt(96) = sqrt(16*6) )= 4*sqrt(6) ≈4 * 2.44949 ≈9.79796.

So sqrt(96)/10 ≈0.979796.

So, gamma is 1/0.979796 ≈1.0206.

So, t = gamma * t' =50 *1.0206=51.03 s.

So, the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03 s =60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000.

C) 2,880,000.

D) 3,060,000.

Hmm, 3,061,800 is close to option D's 3,060,000. But wait, perhaps the calculation is more precise.

Wait, perhaps we should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) to more decimal places.

We can use the Taylor series or iterative methods.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

We know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is just a bit higher than 0.96.

So, let me find x such that (0.98 - delta)^2 =0.96.

(0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.9604 - 2*0.98*delta + delta² ≈ 0.9604 -1.96 delta.

Set this equal to 0.96:

0.9604 -1.96 delta ≈0.96.

0.9604 -0.96 =1.96 delta.

0.0004 =1.96 delta.

delta=0.0004 /1.96 ≈0.0002041.

So, sqrt(0.96) ≈0.98 -0.0002041 =0.979796.

Wait, that's what I had earlier. So, gamma is 1/0.979796 ≈1.0206.

So t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.

So, distance is 60,000 *51.03 km.

60,000 *51=3,060,000.

60,000 *0.03=1,800.

Total 3,061,800 km.

But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is option D, which is 3,060,000. But why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, but in the galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy.

Wait, but in any case, the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame is v*t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But perhaps I should think about this differently. Maybe the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's frame, but maybe I should use velocity addition or something else.

Wait, another approach: the proper time is the time in the rest frame of the moving object. So, the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the galaxy. So, the proper time for the ejecta is t'.

But wait, when the ejecta is moving, the time experienced by the galaxy is longer. So, t = gamma * t'.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the formula for distance in S frame.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting you to use v*t without considering relativity, but that seems unlikely because the speed is a significant fraction of c.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

v =60,000 km/s =6e4 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

Wait, wait a second! Wait, wait. I just realized I messed up the units earlier. Oh no! Because 60,000 km/s is much less than the speed of light.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, c is approximately 300,000 km/s (3e5 km/s). So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light. So, significant, but not super high. So relativistic effects are present.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I converted v to m/s, but perhaps I should have kept it in km/s.

So, v=6e4 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

So, v/c = 0.2.

So, v²/c² =0.04.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) =1/sqrt(0.96)=1.0206, same as before.

So, t = gamma * t' =50 *1.0206 ≈51.03 s.

So, the distance is 6e4 km/s *51.03 s =6e4 *51.03 km =3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that, the closest is D)3,060,000 km.

Hmm, could it be that the question is assuming non-relativistic speeds? Because if we ignore relativity, then t =t' =50 s, and distance would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But the question says both are inertial frames, which implies that relativity applies, but perhaps the intended solution is to ignore relativity?

Wait, but the options don't have 3,061,800, but D is 3,060,000, which is close. So perhaps the question expects the exact value, but maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

Let me calculate 0.979796^2 = (0.98 -0.000204)^2 =0.98^2 -2*0.98*0.000204 + (0.000204)^2.

0.98^2 =0.9604.

2*0.98*0.000204= 0.98 * 0.000408= 0.000400 approximately.

So, 0.9604 -0.0004=0.9600.

The square of 0.979796 is approximately 0.96, so that's correct.

So, gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So, t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.

So, the distance is 60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.

But let's check the options again.

Option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 3.06e6 km.

Hmm, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the time dilation and calculate using t'=50 s.

Wait, but that would give 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But that can't be right because the correct answer would require considering relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction of the time dilation wrong.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v, so the proper time for the ejecta is t', and the galaxy would experience more time. So, t = gamma * t'.

But the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So, from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's time is dilated. Therefore, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's.

Wait, no, wait: time dilation works such that the moving clock runs slower. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower. So, if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, the galaxy would see more than 50 seconds passing.

Wait, but in the scenario, we have the ejecta moving towards the galaxy. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving at v, so it's time is dilated.

So, the galaxy would measure a longer time for the same event. So, t = gamma * t'.

So, that's what I did earlier.

Wait, but then I proceed to calculate 51.03 seconds in the galaxy's frame, leading to distance 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity of the ejecta as seen in the galaxy's frame, which is v, and the time is t=gamma * t'.

So, distance is v * t =v * gamma * t'.

So, substituting the numbers:

v =60,000 km/s.

gamma = 1.0206.

t' =50 s.

So, distance =60,000 *1.0206 *50.

Wait, that's 60,000 *50 *1.0206.

Wait, 60,000 *50 =3e6.

3e6 *1.0206 =3,061,800 km.

Hmm, same as before. So, 3,061,800 km.

But the options are:

A) 2,940,000

B)3,000,000

C)2,880,000

D)3,060,000.

So, the closest is D, but it's 3,060,000, which is 60,000 *51.

Wait, perhaps the question wants the answer to the nearest 10,000 km, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is 1.0206, but the time is 51.03, which when multiplied by 60,000 gives 3,061,800, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is not about time dilation but about relative velocities.

Wait, perhaps the distance that the ejecta travels in its own frame is x' = v' * t', but since the problem is from the galaxy's frame, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the problem says: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so the distance is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But we need to find t given that t'=50s.

So, t=gamma * t'.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So, perhaps the option D is the intended answer, but with the approximation, perhaps the exact gamma is taken as 1.02.

Wait, let me compute gamma again:

v =60,000 km/s =0.6e5 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

v/c=0.2.

v²/c²=0.04.

1 -v²/c²=0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(0.96)=1/(0.9797959)≈1.0206056.

So, t=50 *1.0206056≈51.03028 s.

So, distance is 60,000 *51.03028=3,061,816.8 km.

Which is approximately 3,061,817 km.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation gamma ≈1 + (v²)/(2c²) for low speeds. But 0.2c is not that low.

Wait, let me compute gamma using the approximation:

gamma ≈1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

v²=0.04 c².

So, (v²)/(2 c²)=0.04/2=0.02.

So, gamma ≈1.02.

Then, t=50 *1.02=51 s.

So, distance=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km.

Which is option D.

Ah, so maybe that's what the problem expects. So, the answer is D.

So, the correct answer is D)3,060,000 km.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the galaxy, considering relativistic effects due to the high velocity of the ejecta. The ejecta is moving at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (\( c \) is the speed of light). Since the problem involves inertial frames, we use special relativity to relate time intervals in the two frames.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
The time dilation formula in special relativity is:

\[
t = \gamma t'
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) is the time in the ejecta's frame, and \( t \) is the time in the galaxy's frame.

1. Compute \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. Compute \( t \):
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

### Step 2: Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame
In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and the time taken is \( t \). The distance traveled is:

\[
d = v \cdot t
\]

Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):

\[
d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Closest Option
The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**D) \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)**.

### Final Answer
The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Answer: D
