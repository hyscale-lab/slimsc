Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember about equilibrium temperature.

I think equilibrium temperature is calculated based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), right? Oh wait, but wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part might cancel out in the ratio.

The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K. The planets have their masses and radii, but I'm not sure if those matter directly for equilibrium temperature. Wait, equilibrium temperature is mainly about the star and distance, right? So the planet's mass and radius probably don't affect it much. But how do I get the distance of each planet from the star?

The problem mentions the radial velocity method and transit method. Oh, right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The transit method measures the drop in brightness when the planet passes in front. But to find the distance, I might need to relate the RV shift and the transit data.

Wait, the problem gives the RV shifts for each planet. It says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Those are the Doppler shifts measured in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

The formula for RV shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star. So delta_lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1, and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The [OI] line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å. So v1 = (delta_lambda1 / lambda) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. But maybe I don't need the exact value if I'm taking the ratio.

But I'm not sure if I need the velocities themselves. Let me think. The radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet in a certain way. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_star) ) / (4 pi^2) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, but sin i is 90 degrees because we see the transits (since transits imply edge-on orbits, so sin i = 1). So maybe I can relate the velocities from RV to the planet masses and orbital periods.

Wait, but maybe I don't have the periods. Hmm. Alternatively, I'm supposed to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, which depends on the inverse square root of the distance. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because equilibrium temperature scales as T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So if I can find the ratio of a2/a1, then I can find the temperature ratio.

How do I find the a's? Since the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. Alternatively, Kepler's third law relates the period and the semi-major axis. But without knowing the periods, maybe I can find the ratio of the velocities (from RV shifts) to get the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Wait, the RV velocity is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/(a^(1/3)) ), but maybe that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v_star) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) ^ (1/ (2 * something)) ). Wait, maybe it's better to look for the formula for K.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e^2)) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, the formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But without knowing the periods, how can we proceed? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe if I can find the ratio of K1 and K2, which is given by the RV shifts, then I can find the ratio of their (M_p / (M_star)^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ), or something like that.

Wait, the RV shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is K. So for each planet, K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) ) ), considering that M_p << M_star. Because M_planet is much less than M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So let me write:

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) )

But wait, more precisely, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the simplified form when e is zero and M_p << M_star.

So, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (c * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )) )) )

Wait, maybe not. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 day) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe using the fact that for circular orbits and edge-on inclination (since we have transits), sin i = 1. So for each planet, K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) )

So K1 / K2 = (M1 / (M_star^(1/3) a1^(1/3)) ) / (M2 / (M_star^(1/3) a2^(1/3)) ) )

Simplifying, K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) ) )

So, (K1/K2) = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)

So, rearranging, (a2/a1) = ( ( K1/K2 ) * (M2/M1) ) )^3

We know K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M2/M1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So a2/a1 = (0.75 * 0.7143 )^3.

Wait, 0.75 * 0.7143 is approximately 0.5357.

Cubing that: 0.5357^3 ≈ 0.154.

Wait, let me compute 0.5357^3.

0.5^3 is 0.125, 0.5357 is a little more. Let's compute 0.5357 * 0.5357 = approx 0.287. Then 0.287 * 0.5357 ≈ 0.154.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.154.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the ratio is (a2/a1) = ( (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ) )^3.

Because K1/K2 is 0.75, M2/M1 is 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So 0.75 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.5357. Cubed is approx 0.154.

So a2 is about 0.154 times a1. So a1 is larger than a2.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the distance. So the temperature ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2/(2a1) ) * (R_star factor) / ( sqrt(a2/(2a1)) )

Wait no, equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a_p) )

So T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) )

The ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.154) ≈ 0.392.

So T1 is about 0.392 times T2. So the ratio is T1/T2 ≈ 0.392.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

Hmm, 0.392 isn't among them. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I flipped the ratio. Because a2/a1 is 0.154, so a1 is bigger than a2. So a2 is smaller, meaning Planet2 is closer to the star. So T2 would be higher than T1 because it's closer.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

So if a2 < a1, then sqrt( a2 / a1 ) is less than 1, so T2 is less than T1? Wait no. Wait, because T_p is proportional to sqrt(1/a). So if a2 < a1, then 1/a2 >1/a1, so sqrt(1/a2) > sqrt(1/a1), so T2 > T1.

Wait, looking back: T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a_p)).

So T_p is proportional to sqrt(1/a_p). So the planet closer to the star (smaller a) has higher T_p.

So with a2 = 0.154 a1, then a2 is smaller, so a_p2 is smaller, so T_p2 is higher than T_p1.

So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.154) ≈ 0.392. But the options don't have that. So maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should have taken a1/a2 instead.

Wait, let's double-check the K formula.

Earlier, I said K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^(1/3) a^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) / (M2 a1^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Let me rederive this part.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/ (something)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the period and semi-major axis.

Alternatively, another approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(2 pi G ))^(1/3) ) * (1/(c)) ) * (P/ (1 day) )^(-1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should use the simplified version for K when M_p << M_star and e=0.

So, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative way.

Another approach: The Doppler shift (K) depends on the velocity of the star. The velocity is given by v = (2 pi a) / P * (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) )^(1/ something)

Wait, perhaps let's consider the formula for RV semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( ( G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (something)) ) * (1/(c)) )

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = G (M_star + M_p) / (4 pi^2) )

Since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.

So, a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star.

But without knowing P, the period, I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, but from the transit method, we can find the orbital period. Because the transit method gives the inclination, which is close to 90 degrees, but the period can be found from the Doppler shift as well.

Wait, no, the transit method gives the period as the time between transits. But the problem doesn't give the periods. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives the RV shifts, which relate to the velocities. The maximum velocity of the star is K.

But another way: the maximum velocity K is related to the orbital speed of the planet. The orbital speed v_p is given by v_p = 2 pi a / P.

But from the center-of-mass, the star's velocity is v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) ) * v_p.

Since M_p << M_star, v_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p.

v_p is sqrt( G M_star / a ), from orbital mechanics.

So, v_p = sqrt( G M_star / a )

So, v_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

= sqrt( G M_star ) * M_p / ( M_star sqrt(a) )

= sqrt( G M_p^2 / (M_star a) )

Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

But combining these, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) )

Wait, from v_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

= (M_p ) * sqrt( G / (a M_star ) )

= ( M_p ) / sqrt( a M_star ) * sqrt(G )

So K = (M_p ) / sqrt( a M_star ) ) * sqrt( G )

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_p) / sqrt( a M_star )

So, K1/K2 = ( (M_p1 ) / sqrt( a1 M_star ) ) / ( (M_p2 ) / sqrt( a2 M_star ) ) )

= (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, (K1/K2) = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can rearrange this to find (a2/a1):

sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )

Then, a2/a1 = [ (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1) ]^2

Wait, that's different from earlier. So let's compute this.

We have:

K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å.

M_p1 = 7 Earth masses, M_p2 =5 Earth masses.

So, M_p2 / M_p1 =5/7 ≈0.7143.

K1/K2 =0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.5357

So sqrt(a2/a1) ≈0.5357, so a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈0.287.

So a2 is about 0.287 times a1.

Wait, that's different from before. Earlier I got a2/a1 ≈0.154, but that was with a different approach. So which approach is correct?

I think this approach is correct because I used the formula for K more accurately.

So, with a2/a1 ≈0.287, then the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So, T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So T1/T2 ≈0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

So the answer should be C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a_p}}
\]

Here, \(T_p\) is proportional to \(\sqrt{1/a_p}\), meaning the equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the planet's orbital distance \(a_p\). Since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data provided. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a_p M_{\text{star}}}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of \(K_1\) to \(K_2\) gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), so \(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\),
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), so \(\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.75 \cdot 0.7143)^2 \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to option C, which is approximately \(0.53\).

Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember about equilibrium temperature.

Those are the Doppler shifts measured in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

The formula for RV shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star. So delta_lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1, and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The [OI] line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å. So v1 = (delta_lambda1 / lambda) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. But maybe I don't need the exact value if I'm taking the ratio.

But I'm not sure if I need the velocities themselves. Let me think. The radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet in a certain way. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_star) ) / (4 pi^2) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, but sin i is 90 degrees because we see the transits (since transits imply edge-on orbits, so sin i = 1).

So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because equilibrium temperature scales as T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So if I can find the ratio of a2/a1, then I can find the temperature ratio.

How do I find the a's? Since the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. Alternatively, Kepler's third law relates the period and the semi-major axis. But without knowing the periods, maybe I can find the ratio of the velocities (from RV shifts) to get the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Wait, the RV velocity is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/(a^(1/3)) ), but maybe that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v_star) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) ^ (1/ (2 * something)) ). Wait, maybe it's better to look for the formula for K.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e^2)) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, the formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But without knowing the periods, how can we proceed? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe if I can find the ratio of K1 and K2, which is given by the RV shifts, then I can find the ratio of their (M_p / (M_star)^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ), or something like that.

Wait, the RV shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is K. So for each planet, K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) ) ), considering that M_p << M_star. Because M_planet is much less than M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So let me write:

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) )

But wait, more precisely, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the simplified form when e is zero and M_p << M_star.

So, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (c * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )) )) )

Wait, maybe not. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 day) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe using the fact that for circular orbits and edge-on inclination (since we have transits), sin i = 1. So for each planet, K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) )

So K1 / K2 = (M1 / (M_star^(1/3) a1^(1/3)) ) / (M2 / (M_star^(1/3) a2^(1/3)) ) )

Simplifying, K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) ) )

So, (K1/K2) = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)

So, rearranging, (a2/a1) = ( ( K1/K2 ) * (M2/M1) ) )^3

We know K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M2/M1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So a2/a1 = (0.75 * 0.7143 )^3.

Wait, 0.75 * 0.7143 is approximately 0.5357.

Cubing that: 0.5357^3 ≈ 0.154.

Wait, let me compute 0.5357^3.

0.5^3 is 0.125, 0.5357 is a little more. Let's compute 0.5357 * 0.5357 = approx 0.287. Then 0.287 * 0.5357 ≈ 0.154.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.154.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the ratio is (a2/a1) = ( (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ) )^3.

Because K1/K2 is 0.75, M2/M1 is 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So 0.75 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.5357. Cubed is approx 0.154.

So a2 is about 0.154 times a1. So a1 is larger than a2.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the distance. So the temperature ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2/(2a1) ) * (R_star factor) / ( sqrt(a2/(2a1)) )

Wait no, equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a_p) )

So T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) )

The ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.154) ≈ 0.392.

So T1 is about 0.392 times T2. So the ratio is T1/T2 ≈ 0.392.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

Hmm, 0.392 isn't among them. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I flipped the ratio. Because a2/a1 is 0.154, so a1 is bigger than a2. So a2 is smaller, meaning Planet2 is closer to the star. So T2 would be higher than T1 because it's closer.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

So if a2 < a1, then sqrt( a2 / a1 ) is less than 1, so T2 is less than T1? Wait no. Wait, because T_p is proportional to sqrt(1/a). So if a2 < a1, then 1/a2 >1/a1, so sqrt(1/a2) > sqrt(1/a1), so T2 > T1.

Wait, looking back: T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a_p)).

So T_p is proportional to sqrt(1/a_p). So the planet closer to the star (smaller a) has higher T_p.

So with a2 = 0.154 a1, then a2 is smaller, so a_p2 is smaller, so T_p2 is higher than T_p1.

So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.154) ≈ 0.392. But the options don't have that. So maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should have taken a1/a2 instead.

Wait, let's double-check the K formula.

Earlier, I said K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^(1/3) a^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) / (M2 a1^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Let me rederive this part.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/ (something)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the period and semi-major axis.

Alternatively, another approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(2 pi G ))^(1/3) ) * (1/(c)) ) * (P/ (1 day) )^(-1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should use the simplified version for K when M_p << M_star and e=0.

So, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative way.

Another approach: The Doppler shift (K) depends on the velocity of the star. The velocity is given by v = (2 pi a) / P * (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) )^(1/ something)

Wait, perhaps let's consider the formula for RV semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( ( G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (something)) ) * (1/(c)) )

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = G (M_star + M_p) / (4 pi^2) )

Since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.

So, a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star.

But without knowing P, the period, I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, but from the transit method, we can find the orbital period. Because the transit method gives the inclination, which is close to 90 degrees, but the period can be found from the Doppler shift as well.

Wait, no, the transit method gives the period as the time between transits. But the problem doesn't give the periods. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives the RV shifts, which relate to the velocities. The maximum velocity of the star is K.

But another way: the maximum velocity K is related to the orbital speed of the planet. The orbital speed v_p is given by v_p = 2 pi a / P.

But from the center-of-mass, the star's velocity is v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) ) * v_p.

Since M_p << M_star, v_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p.

v_p is sqrt( G M_star / a ), from orbital mechanics.

So, v_p = sqrt( G M_star / a )

So, v_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

= sqrt( G M_star ) * M_p / ( M_star sqrt(a) )

= sqrt( G M_p^2 / (M_star a) )

Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

But combining these, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) )

Wait, from v_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

= (M_p ) * sqrt( G / (a M_star ) )

= ( M_p ) / sqrt( a M_star ) * sqrt(G )

So K = (M_p ) / sqrt( a M_star ) ) * sqrt( G )

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_p) / sqrt( a M_star )

So, K1/K2 = ( (M_p1 ) / sqrt( a1 M_star ) ) / ( (M_p2 ) / sqrt( a2 M_star ) ) )

= (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, (K1/K2) = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can rearrange this to find (a2/a1):

sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )

Then, a2/a1 = [ (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1) ]^2

Wait, that's different from earlier. So let's compute this.

We have:

K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å.

M_p1 = 7 Earth masses, M_p2 =5 Earth masses.

So, M_p2 / M_p1 =5/7 ≈0.7143.

K1/K2 =0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.5357

So sqrt(a2/a1) ≈0.5357, so a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈0.287.

So a2 is about 0.287 times a1.

Wait, that's different from before. Earlier I got a2/a1 ≈0.154, but that was with a different approach. So which approach is correct?

I think this approach is correct because I used the formula for K more accurately.

So, with a2/a1 ≈0.287, then the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So, T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So T1/T2 ≈0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a_p}}
\]

Here, \(T_p\) is proportional to \(\sqrt{1/a_p}\), meaning the equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the planet's orbital distance \(a_p\). Since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data provided. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a_p M_{\text{star}}}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of \(K_1\) to \(K_2\) gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), so \(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\),
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), so \(\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.75 \cdot 0.7143)^2 \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to option C, which is approximately \(0.53\).
