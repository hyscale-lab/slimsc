Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. I think it's an exponential decay process, not like a linear one. 

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom has decayed. That probably means the probability of decay is based on the half-life or something like that. Wait, but 32% is the probability, not the remaining quantity. So I'm a bit confused about how that relates to the half-life formula.

Wait, the formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining, N0 is the initial amount, λ is the decay constant, and t is time. The decay probability would be 1 - N(t)/N0. So if the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32, that would mean N(t)/N0 is 0.68 remaining. So 0.68 = e^(-λ*100). Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So lambda would be -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, so lambda is 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So we're at t=50, and we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which would be t=200 from the start. Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability from t=50 to t=200? So the time elapsed from 50 to 200 is 150 minutes.

But wait, the key point in radioactive decay is that the process is memoryless. That means the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the decay constant. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, and the probability would be calculated based on that.

Wait, but let me think again. The decay probability over a certain time is given, so perhaps we should model it as the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 0.32. So the probability of decay at any point in time is based on the decay constant.

Wait, perhaps I should find the decay constant first. Let's proceed step by step.

Given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so P=0.32. The decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt). So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Therefore, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking ln on both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that.

Calculating ln(0.68): I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's see, using calculator steps: ln(0.68)= ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is: after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. We need the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the time elapsed from 50 to 200 minutes is 150 minutes. The probability is the same as the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200. Because the process is memoryless, the probability depends only on the time interval, not when you start.

Alternatively, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150). Let's calculate that.

Compute λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ Let's see, e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it. Let's compute 0.57849.

Another approach is to compute ln(0.57849) is not needed; rather, compute e^(-0.57849). Alternatively, using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll use the fact that e^0.57849 is approximately 1.783. Wait, because ln(1.783)= approx 0.578. So e^(-0.578) ≈ 1/1.783 ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So the probability is 44%, which is option A. But wait, let me check my numbers again.

Wait, 1 - e^(-λt) is the decay probability. So for t=150, 1 - e^(-λ*150) = 1 - e^(-0.57849).

Wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate λ. Because earlier, when I calculated λ as 0.0038566 per minute, times 150 minutes is about 0.5785. So e^(-0.5785) is approximately what?

Hmm, e^0.5785 is approximately 1.783. So e^-0.5785 is 1/1.783 ≈ 0.56. So 1-0.56 is 0.44, which is 44% as before.

So the probability is 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial data says that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. That's the probability that it decays within that time. So the decay rate λ is calculated as λ = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)))/100 = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.470588)/100 ≈ 0.3856/100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute. So that's correct.

So for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^{-0.003856 *150} = 1 - e^{-0.5784}.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this more accurately. Let me use more precise numbers.

Compute 0.003856 * 150 = 0.5784. So e^{-0.5784}.

We know that e^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.6 is about 1.82211. So 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me try to compute e^0.5784.

The exact value of e^0.5784 can be found using Taylor series or approximation. Let me use the linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

At x=0.5, e^x=1.64872.

At x=0.6, e^x=1.82211.

The difference between x=0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the e^x increases by about 1.82211 - 1.64872 = 0.17339 over that interval.

We have x=0.5784; that's 0.0784 above 0.5. So the fraction is 0.0784 /0.1 = 0.784.

So the expected e^0.5784 ≈ 1.64872 + (0.784 * 0.17339) ≈ 1.64872 + 0.13655 ≈ 1.78527.

So e^(-0.5784)=1/1.78527≈0.56.

So 1 -0.56=0.44, which is 44%.

So the probability is 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but another approach: maybe the question is considering the conditional probability. Because the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the probability in the next 150 is the same as in any 150-minute span. So, yes, it's the same as I computed.

Alternatively, some might think that the 50 minutes affects it, but no, because the decay process is independent of the past.

So the correct answer should be 44%, option A.

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the principles of radioactive decay, which is an exponential process. The decay probability is memoryless, meaning it depends only on the time interval and not on how much time has already passed without decay.

### Step 1: Decay constant calculation
The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P = 0.32 \). Using the formula for the probability of decay:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

we can solve for the decay constant \( \lambda \). Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda t} = 1 - P
\]

Substituting \( P = 0.32 \) and \( t = 100 \):

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the probability depends only on the time interval of 150 minutes. Using the same decay formula:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda = 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
P = 1 - e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 150}
\]

Calculate \( \lambda \cdot t \):

\[
\lambda \cdot t = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56
\]

Thus:

\[
P = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

### Conclusion
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.
