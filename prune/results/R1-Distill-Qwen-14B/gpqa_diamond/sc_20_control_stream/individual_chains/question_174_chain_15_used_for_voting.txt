Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest. That means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel each other out. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the less massive one.

The sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M. So, the initial mass is M, and the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Let me write that down:

m1 = 2 m2
m1 + m2 = 0.99 M

Substituting m1 in the second equation: 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

So, the rest masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, but after fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So, the rest masses of the two fragments sum to less than the original. That means there's mass defect, and energy is released, probably as kinetic energy.

So, energy and mass are related via E=mc². The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The total rest energy of the fragments is 0.99 M c², which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So, the remaining energy is 3 GeV, which is the energy released, some of which goes into kinetic energy of the two fragments.

But wait, in reality, the energy includes kinetic as well as binding energy, but I think in this problem, they're considering that all the released energy goes into kinetic. Or maybe not. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments' momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction so that their sum is zero. Let's denote the speed of the more massive fragment as v1 and the less as v2. Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Because m1 is twice m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2. So, the lighter fragment moves twice as fast as the heavier one.

But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, maybe the velocities are not so simply related. Oh, right, because in relativity, momentum isn't just mass times velocity; it's γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So, that complicates things.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the non-relativistic approximation. So, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the approximation uses classical mechanics, ignoring relativistic effects. So, in that case, the velocities are treated as non-relativistic, and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

So, first, let's model the non-relativistic case, then the relativistic case, and find the difference.

In the non-relativistic scenario, let's compute the velocities and kinetic energies.

Let me denote:

m1 = 0.66 M
m2 = 0.33 M

Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2. So,

0.66 M v1 = 0.33 M v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

So, v2 is twice v1.

Now, the kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2².

Total kinetic energy (non-relativistic) would be KE_total_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2.

Let me compute that:

= (1/2) * 0.66 M v1² + (1/2) * 0.33 M *4 v1²
= (0.33 M v1²) + (0.66 M v1²)
= (0.33 + 0.66) M v1²
= 0.99 M v1².

Wait, but the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The rest energy after is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So, the total energy after is 297 GeV + KE_total_nonrel.

But the initial energy is just 300 GeV (since the nucleus is at rest). So,

300 GeV = 297 GeV + KE_total_nonrel.

So, KE_total_nonrel = 3 GeV.

So, 0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV → M v1² = 3 / 0.99 ≈ 3.0303 GeV.

Wait, but in non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1².

Which is (1/2) * 0.66 M v1² = 0.33 M v1².

From earlier, M v1² is about 3.0303 GeV, so 0.33 * 3.0303 ≈ 1 GeV. So, T1_nonrel is approximately 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. Oh, because 0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV, so M v1² = 3 / 0.99 ≈ 3.0303 GeV.

Then T1_nonrel = 0.33 * M v1² = 0.33 * (3.0303 GeV) ≈ 1 GeV, yes.

But wait, that's a lot. 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. But the options are in MeV. So, perhaps the correct answer is something like 10 MeV or 20 MeV, but let me not get ahead of myself.

Now, let's compute the correct (relativistic) T1.

In the relativistic case, we must consider the conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is Mc², which is 300 GeV. After fission, the energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. Also, the total momentum must be zero.

So, let's denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2, but in opposite directions.

Let’s define β1 = v1/c and β2 = v2/c. So, the velocities are in terms of c.

The momentum of each fragment is γ m v, where γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²).

So, since momentum must cancel, m1 γ1 β1 c = m2 γ2 β2 c.

Wait, but direction matters; one is positive, the other negative. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can write:

m1 γ1 β1 = m2 γ2 β2.

Also, from the energy perspective, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

So,

Total energy after = m1 c² + m2 c² + (KE1 + KE2).

But KE is (γ - 1) m c². So,

Total energy after = [m1 + m2] c² + (γ1 m1 c² - m1 c²) + (γ2 m2 c² - m2 c²)
= (m1 + m2) c² + (γ1 m1 + γ2 m2) c² - (m1 + m2) c²
= (γ1 m1 + γ2 m2) c².

Which must equal the initial energy, which is Mc².

So,

(γ1 m1 + γ2 m2) c² = M c².

Divide both sides by c²:

γ1 m1 + γ2 m2 = M.

But earlier, we have m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So,

γ1 (0.66 M) + γ2 (0.33 M) = M.

Divide both sides by M,

0.66 γ1 + 0.33 γ2 = 1.

Additionally, from momentum conservation,

m1 γ1 β1 = m2 γ2 β2.

Substituting m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M,

0.66 M * γ1 β1 = 0.33 M * γ2 β2.

Cancel M and 0.33,

2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2.

So, equation 1: 0.66 γ1 + 0.33 γ2 = 1.

Equation 2: 2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2.

But β is v/c. Let's see if we can relate β1 and β2. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express β1 and β2 in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the two particles are moving in opposite directions, so their velocities are opposite. Let's denote the velocity of the more massive fragment as v, the other as u. Since it's the opposite direction, maybe u = -v * (something). But perhaps not, since their masses are different, their velocities might not be the same. Hmm.

Wait, but from the momentum equation:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

Since they're moving in opposite directions, v2 is negative. So,

0.66 M γ1 v1 = 0.33 M γ2 (-v2).

But maybe it's easier to take magnitudes, so:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

So,

(0.66) γ1 v1 = (0.33) γ2 v2 → 2 γ1 v1 = γ2 v2.

Wait, but v is in terms of c, so β = v/c. Let's rewrite v as β c.

So,

2 γ1 (β1 c) = γ2 (β2 c)

Simplify c:

2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2.

So, equation 2 is 2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2.

Hmm. Now, I need to find γ1, γ2, β1, β2.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can express everything in terms of a single variable.

Another approach: since the two fragments are the only products, the velocities can be expressed in terms of each other via the momentum equation.

Let me denote the speed of the more massive fragment as v, and the speed of the lighter as u.

Then, from momentum conservation: m1 γ1 v = m2 γ2 u.

But m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M, so:

0.66 M γ1 v = 0.33 M γ2 u → 2 γ1 v = γ2 u.

So, u = (2 γ1 v) / γ2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric in terms of mass ratios, perhaps there's a substitution I can make. Let me think about the energy equation.

From the energy equation:

0.66 γ1 + 0.33 γ2 = 1.

So,

Divide both sides by 0.33:

2 γ1 + γ2 = 100/33 ≈ 3.0303.

Wait, let's calculate 100/33:

100 ÷ 33 ≈ 3.0303.

So,

2 γ1 + γ2 = 3.0303.

From the momentum equation, 2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2 → γ2 = (2 γ1 β1) / β2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can express β2 in terms of β1 and the gammas.

Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of γ1.

Wait, let me make a substitution. Let me let γ2 = (2 γ1 β1)/ β2.

But that introduces another variable. Hmm. Maybe I should consider the relation between β and γ. Since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So, beta is a function of gamma.

Let me think, perhaps I can write u in terms of v and their gammas.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can try to make an assumption that the velocities are not too high, but wait, the non-relativistic approach gives T1 as 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV, but the options are in the range of 10-20 MeV. So the relativistic correction must be small, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the non-relativistic case again.

In non-relativistic, the total kinetic energy was 3 GeV, so each fragment's KE is about 1 GeV and 2 GeV. But wait, in non-relativistic, the more massive fragment has T1_nonrel = 1 GeV, as earlier.

But in reality, the velocities may be higher, so perhaps the KE is different. Wait, but if the non-relativistic approach gives a higher KE, then the correct value would be lower, because relativistic effects would limit the kinetic energy due to the increased mass (γ factor).

Wait, but the opposite could be the case. Hmm. Let me think.

In non-relativistic mechanics, KE is (1/2)mv², which grows quadratically with velocity. But in reality, when velocities approach the speed of light, the kinetic energy grows more than quadratically because of the gamma factor. So, for very high velocities, relativistic KE is higher than non-relativistic.

Wait, but in our case, the non-relativistic calculation gives a KE of 1 GeV, but maybe in reality, it's higher. But wait, the mass after fission is 0.99 M, but the initial is M, so the mass defect is 1% of M, which is 3 GeV. So, the KE can't be more than that.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the KE is 3 GeV, which is the entire 1% mass defect. But in reality, some energy goes into binding the fragments (maybe?), but the problem says to ignore electrons, so perhaps all the mass defect goes into kinetic energy, but that's 3 GeV. Oh, wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the KE is 3 GeV, which makes the more massive fragment's KE 1 GeV. So, the correct relativistic KE could be higher or lower?

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, KE scales with v². In the relativistic case, KE scales with (gamma - 1) mc². So, for the same velocity, the relativistic KE is larger than non-relativistic. But in our case, we have conservation of energy and momentum, so the velocities can't be too high because the mass is conserved.

Wait, perhaps instead of getting stuck here, I should proceed step by step.

Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

The initial rest energy is M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total rest energy is (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

The total energy after fission is 297 GeV plus the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

But the total energy must equal the initial energy, which is 300 GeV.

So, KE_total = 3 GeV.

So, KE1 + KE2 = 3 GeV, where KE1 is the kinetic energy of m1 and KE2 of m2.

In the non-relativistic case, KE_total_nonrel = 3 GeV, so KE1_nonrel = (1/3) * 3 GeV = 1 GeV, and KE2_nonrel = 2 GeV, because m1 is twice m2, their velocities are inversely related, leading to their KEs being in a 1:2 ratio.

Wait, earlier when I calculated, I found that KE_total_nonrel was 3 GeV, but from the system, the KE should sum to 3 GeV. So, in that case, the more massive fragment's KE_nonrel is 1 GeV.

Now, for the relativistic case, the KEs are different.

But how to compute them? Let's set up the equations.

We have two equations:

1) 0.66 γ1 + 0.33 γ2 = 1.

2) 2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2.

And, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV:

KE1 + KE2 = (γ1 - 1) m1 c² + (γ2 - 1) m2 c² = 3 GeV.

Let me substitute m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So,

(γ1 -1) (0.66 M c²) + (γ2 -1) (0.33 M c²) = 3 GeV.

But M c² is 300 GeV, so 0.66 M c² = 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV, and 0.33 M c² = 99 GeV.

So,

(γ1 -1) * 198 + (γ2 -1) * 99 = 3.

Let me simplify:

198 (γ1 -1) + 99 (γ2 -1) = 3.

Factor out 99:

99 [ 2 (γ1 -1) + (γ2 -1) ] = 3 → 2 (γ1 -1) + (γ2 -1) = 3 / 99 ≈ 0.0303.

Simplify the left side:

2 γ1 - 2 + γ2 -1 = (2 γ1 + γ2) -3 = 0.0303.

So,

2 γ1 + γ2 = 3.0303.

Which matches equation 1.

So, equation 1 and this give the same result. So, we have equation 1: 2 γ1 + γ2 = 3.0303.

Equation 2 is 2 γ1 β1 = γ2 β2.

Now, we need another equation, perhaps involving beta and gamma.

We know that for each fragment, β = v/c, and γ = 1/√(1 - β²).

So, for fragment 1, β1 = sqrt(1 - (1/γ1²)).

Similarly for fragment 2: β2 = sqrt(1 - (1/γ2²)).

So, substituting into equation 2:

2 γ1 sqrt(1 - (1/γ1²)) = γ2 sqrt(1 - (1/γ2²)).

Hmm. This looks complicated, but perhaps we can make an assumption based on the non-relativistic case.

In the non-relativistic case, beta is small, so gamma is approximately 1 + (1/2) beta².

But if the kinetic energies are significant, perhaps beta isn't that small, so we can't make that approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are such that beta1 is much smaller than beta2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the more massive fragment has lower speed, so beta1 is smaller than beta2.

But let's think about the ratio of their velocities.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, v2 = 2 v1. But in the relativistic case, due to the momentum equation, the relation between velocities would be different.

Hmm. This is getting tricky. Maybe I can make an assumption that gamma2 is much larger than gamma1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me denote equation 1 as:

gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Now, substitute this into equation 2.

Equation 2:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²), beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

So,

2 gamma1 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²) = gamma2 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

Substitute gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can make an educated guess.

Let me suppose that gamma1 is approximately 1, meaning the fragment isn't moving too fast. Then gamma2 would be 3.0303 - 2 (1) = 1.0303.

If gamma1 is about 1, then beta1 is sqrt(1 - 1) = 0 → no, wait. If gamma is 1, then beta is zero. So, that can't be right. But that would imply the fragment isn't moving, which can't happen because the other fragment would have to move, but then the momentum wouldn't balance. So, perhaps gamma1 is not exactly 1.

Alternatively, perhaps gamma1 is slightly larger than 1, say gamma1 = 1.01.

Wait, let me try some trial and error.

Assume gamma1 = 1.01.

Then gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 * 1.01 = 3.0303 - 2.02 = 1.0103.

So, gamma2 is approximately 1.0103.

Then beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.01)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(1.0201)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9804) ≈ sqrt(0.0196) ≈ 0.14.

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.0103)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/1.0207) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9800) ≈ sqrt(0.02) ≈ 0.1414.

Now, let's check equation 2:

Left side: 2 * 1.01 * 0.14 ≈ 2 * 1.01 * 0.14 ≈ 0.2828.

Right side: 1.0103 * 0.1414 ≈ 1.0103 * 0.1414 ≈ 0.143.

Hmm, the left side is 0.2828, right is 0.143. Not equal. So, the assumption of gamma1=1.01 is incorrect.

Maybe I need a higher gamma1.

Let me try gamma1=1.05.

gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 * 1.05 = 3.0303 - 2.10 = 0.9303.

Wait, but gamma can't be less than 1. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), which is always >=1.

So, gamma2=0.9303 is invalid. So, gamma1 can't be 1.05.

So, perhaps gamma1 is 1.005.

gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 * 1.005 = 3.0303 - 2.01 = 1.0203.

Beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.005)^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9900) ≈ sqrt(0.01) ≈ 0.1.

Wait, let's compute more accurately:

1/(1.005)^2 = 1/(1.010025) ≈ 0.990075.

1 - 0.990075 = 0.009925.

sqrt(0.009925) ≈ 0.099625.

Beta1 ≈ 0.0996.

Beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.0203)^2).

1.0203^2 ≈ 1.0412.

1/1.0412 ≈ 0.9606.

1 - 0.9606 = 0.0394.

sqrt(0.0394) ≈ 0.1985.

So, equation 2:

Left side: 2 * 1.005 * 0.0996 ≈ 2 * 1.005 * 0.1 ≈ 0.201.

Right side: 1.0203 * 0.1985 ≈ 0.202.

Hmm, this is very close.

So, with gamma1=1.005, gamma2=1.0203.

So, equation 2 is approximately satisfied.

So, let's proceed with these values.

Now, compute the kinetic energies.

KE1 = (gamma1 -1) * m1 c².

m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So,

KE1 = (1.005 -1) * 198 = 0.005 * 198 = 0.99 GeV ≈ 1 GeV.

Similarly, KE2 = (gamma2 -1) * m2 c².

m2 c²= 99 GeV.

gamma2=1.0203 → KE2= (0.0203) *99 ≈ 2 GeV.

So, KE1 ≈1 GeV (relativistic), KE2≈2 GeV.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, KE1_nonrel was 1 GeV, so the difference is zero? But that's not possible because we found that the velocities are slightly higher than non-relativistic.

Wait, but wait, in this trial, gamma1=1.005, which is very close to 1, so the KE is very close to the non-relativistic case. So, perhaps the difference is small, maybe a few MeV.

Wait, but in reality, the KE might be a bit higher in the relativistic case. Let me compute the exact values using the gamma values found.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the difference is small, so the relativistic T1 is T1_rel ≈ 1 GeV, while the non-relativistic is also 1 GeV, so the difference is zero. But that can't be, because the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the trial. Let me compute the exact KE.

Wait, KE1_rel = (gamma1 -1)*198 GeV.

gamma1=1.005 → KE1_rel=0.005 * 198 = 0.99 GeV.

In non-relativistic case, KE1_nonrel is 1 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.99 - 1 = -0.01 GeV, which is -10 MeV. But the options are positive, and the question asks for the difference (T1 correct minus T1 classical).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, and the classical is 1 GeV. So, the difference is T1_rel - T1_class = 0.99 -1 = -0.01 GeV = -10 MeV. But the options give positive differences.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the KE in the relativistic case. Because if the more massive fragment is moving at a higher gamma, maybe it has more KE than non-relativistic.

Wait, but in our trial, we found that in the relativistic case, KE1 is 0.99 GeV, which is less than the non-relativistic case of 1 GeV.

That would suggest that the correct T1 is slightly lower than the classical value, so the difference is negative. But the options are all positive. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the more massive fragment is m1 = 0.66 M, and in the relativistic case, the KE is (gamma1 -1) * m1 c².

If gamma1 is 1.005, then the KE is 0.005 * 198 = 0.99 GeV. So, that's 990 MeV.

In the non-relativistic case, it's approximately 1 GeV (1000 MeV). So, the difference is 990 - 1000 = -10 MeV. So, the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the classical value.

But the options are A)2 MeV, B)5, C)10, D)20.

So, the difference is 10 MeV, but since the correct is lower than classical, the absolute difference is 10 MeV. So, the answer would be 10 MeV.

But wait, the question is phrased as "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation".

Wait, correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical is 1000. So, the difference is 990 - 1000 = -10. But the question doesn't specify direction, just the magnitude. So, the magnitude is 10 MeV.

So, the answer would be C) 10 MeV.

But why did the non-relativistic case give 1000 MeV, and the relativistic calculation give 990 MeV? Because in the relativistic case, the KE is just slightly less.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial assumption was that the kinetic energy in the non-relativistic case is 3 GeV, which sums the KE1 and KE2 to 3 GeV.

But in reality, the total energy of the system is 300 GeV, which equals the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

So, the total KE is 3 GeV, so the non-relativistic case correctly accounts for all of it. But in reality, due to relativistic effects, perhaps some energy is not accounted correctly, leading to a higher or lower KE.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the velocities.

In the non-relativistic approximation:

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

v2 = 2 v1.

Total KE is 3 GeV.

So, KE1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2) * 0.66 M v1².

KE2_nonrel= (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) * 0.33 M *4 v1² = 0.66 M v1².

So, sum is 0.33 M v1² + 0.66 M v1² = 0.99 M v1² =3 GeV.

So, M v1² = 3 /0.99 = 3.0303 GeV.

So, KE1_nonrel = 0.33 * 3.0303 ≈1 GeV.

Now, in the relativistic case, with gamma1=1.005, KE1_rel= (gamma1 -1)*m1 c² = 0.005 *198 =0.99 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.99 -1= -0.01 GeV= -10 MeV.

But the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV (990 MeV), the classical is 1 GeV (1000 MeV). The difference is 10 MeV, with correct being lower by 10 MeV.

So, the answer would be C) 10 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is more precise, and the difference is 5 MeV or another value. But given the options, 10 MeV makes sense.

To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic mechanics. The initial nucleus of rest mass \( M \) (rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \)) splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). The total energy of the system is conserved, and the energy released due to the mass defect (\( 1\% \) of \( M \)) is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is entirely converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case, conservation of momentum gives:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \implies v_2 = 2v_1
\]
The total kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 0.66M \), \( m_2 = 0.33M \), and \( v_2 = 2v_1 \):
\[
KE_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} (0.66M)v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (0.33M)(2v_1)^2 = 0.99Mv_1^2
\]
Since the total kinetic energy is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
0.99Mv_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \implies Mv_1^2 = \frac{3}{0.99} \approx 3.0303 \, \text{GeV}
\]
The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
\[
T_{1,\text{non-rel}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} (0.66M)v_1^2 = 0.33Mv_1^2 \approx 0.33 \times 3.0303 \approx 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Relativistic Case
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment includes its rest energy and kinetic energy. The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2 + KE_1 + KE_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}
\]
The rest energy of the fragments is:
\[
m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2 = 0.99Mc^2 = 0.99 \times 300 = 297 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Thus, the total kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_1 + KE_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Using relativistic momentum conservation and energy conservation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated to be slightly less than the non-relativistic value. After detailed calculations, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be approximately:
\[
T_{1,\text{rel}} \approx 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 990 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Values
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the non-relativistic approximation is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_{1,\text{rel}} - T_{1,\text{non-rel}} = 990 \, \text{MeV} - 1000 \, \text{MeV} = -10 \, \text{MeV}
\]
The magnitude of the difference is \( 10 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) value and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.
