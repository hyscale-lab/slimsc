Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this crystallography problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Let's see what I remember about this.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same. In this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the edge length of the unit cell in crystals. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. In a rhombohedral system, the angles can be different, but in this case, they're all 30 degrees. So each angle is 30°, which is pretty small. That must affect the structure somehow.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the equation 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a² cos² θ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up formulas here. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula involving the reciprocal of the square of the distance. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula I remember for the interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ))). Or something along those lines. Oh right, because in a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance depends on the Miller indices and the angles between the lattice vectors.

Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, all a, b, c are equal, and all the angles α, β, γ are equal to 30 degrees. So the formula might simplify because of the symmetry.

Let me write down the formula correctly. The general formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system is:

d^2 = (a^2) / [h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ]

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, because in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be different. But in this case, all angles are the same, 30 degrees. So I can use this formula.

Wait, actually, I might be mixing up the terms. The correct formula comes from the structure factor or the interplanar spacing in a crystal.

Wait, I think the accurate formula for the interplanar distance d is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a² * cosθ), where θ is the angle between the edges.

Wait, no, I think I should double-check. Another approach: the interplanar distance is calculated using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a general crystal system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (b^2 c^2)) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) ) ]^(1/2) 

Wait, no, that's perhaps for a general case with a, b, c not equal. But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are same, so perhaps that formula can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for a rhombohedral system.

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = θ. Then the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, yes, I think this is correct. Because in the general case, the denominator includes cross terms due to the angles. So when all angles are the same and a=b=c, the formula simplifies.

So the problem is for the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging in the values:

d = a0 / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1)*cosθ )

Since a0 is 10 Angstroms, and θ is 30 degrees.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the denominator inside the square root.

h² + k² + l² = 1 +1+1 =3.

Then 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1+1+1) = 6.

So 2*(hk + ... ) * cosθ = 6 * cos(30°).

cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = about 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196).

What's sqrt(8.196)? Let's compute. 8.196 is close to 8.196. Let's see: 2.86^2 is 8.1796, because 2.86 * 2.86: 2 *2 is 4, 2*0.86 is 1.72, 0.86*2 is 1.72, and 0.86^2 is about 0.7396. Wait maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, let me compute 8.196. Let's see, 2.8^2=7.84. 2.85^2=8.1225. 2.86^2=8.1796. 2.87^2=8.2369. So 8.196 is between 2.86 and 2.87.

Compute 2.86^2=7.84 (no, wait: 2.86^2 = (2 +0.86)^2 =4 + 2*2*0.86 + 0.86² =4 + 3.44 + 0.7396 =8.1796.

So 2.86^2=8.1796. Our denominator inside is 8.196, which is 8.1796 + 0.0164. So let's compute 2.86 + x squared =8.196.

Approximate x. Let me compute (2.86 + x)^2 =8.196.

We know 2.86^2=8.1796. So 2 *2.86 *x +x²= 8.196 -8.1796 = 0.0164.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible. So approximately, 5.72 x ≈0.0164 → x≈0.0164 /5.72≈0.00287.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.86 +0.00287≈2.86287.

So denominator is about 2.86287.

So d =10 / 2.86287 ≈ let's compute 10/2.86287.

Calculating 2.86287 ×3=8.5886, which is less than 10. 10/2.86287 ≈ 3.492.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, I think I messed up. Wait, 2.86287 is the denominator's square root. So d=10 divided by 2.86287.

Wait, 2.86287 is about 2.86.

10 /2.86 ≈ 3.49. Wait, but wait, that's way too small. Because the interatomic distance is 10 Ang. So if the interplanar distance is about 3.49, that would make sense, but let me check the calculation.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the formula I used: d = a0 / sqrt( ... ). So if a0 is 10, and the square root is about 2.86, then 10/2.86 is about 3.49. Hmm, but looking at the options, the answers are all around 9 Angstroms. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Maybe the formula is d^2 = 1/( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a^2 cosθ) ). Or perhaps I inverted the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) [1 + ... terms involving cosθ ]. Maybe I should re-derive the formula.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by vectors a, b, c, all equal in length, with angles between them all equal to θ. The Miller indices are (hkl). The interplanar distance d is given by:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * (1 + cosθ)

Wait, that might be the case. Because for a cubic system (θ=90°, cosθ=0), the formula reduces to 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a², which is correct.

Wait, so if that's the case, then for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

1/d² = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cosθ) / a^2

So let's plug the numbers into this formula.

h,k,l =1,1,1.

h² +k² + l^2 = 3.

hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1=3.

So,

1/d² = (3)/(10^2) - (3) (1 + cos30°)/(10^2)

Compute each part:

(3)/100 = 0.03.

cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660.

So 1 + cos30 ≈1.8660.

Then, 3*(1.8660) =5.598.

So 5.598/100 =0.05598.

So,

1/d² = 0.03 - 0.05598 = -0.02598.

Wait, that can't be right because 1/d² can't be negative.

That's a problem. So this suggests that perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Hmm. So perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct. Let me go back.

Earlier, I used d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but with h=k=l=1, and cosθ=cos30°=√3/2≈0.866.

So,

denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.866) = sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196)≈2.8628, as before.

So d=10 / 2.8628≈3.495 Angstroms. But the options are all around 9 Angstroms, which is way larger. So that's impossible. Hmm, perhaps I inverted the formula.

Wait another thought: perhaps interatomic distance is not a but something else. Oh wait, wait. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a simple cubic structure would be a√3/2 for (111) planes. But perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake about what a is. Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Ang. So for a simple cubic structure, the edge length a would be the same as the interatomic distance. But rhombohedral structures can be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as a, but in this case, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is being calculated.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I should use the relation between the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm supposed to use is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, but in the rhombohedral case, all angles are the same, so that becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is what I used earlier. So in that case, with a=10, theta=30°, this gives d=10/sqrt(3+6*(0.866)).

Wait, 3+6*0.866=3+5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.8628≈3.495 Ang. But that's way smaller than any of the options given (which are around 9 Ang). So this suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the interatomic distance with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the edge length a, but perhaps a different parameter.

Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the crystal. In a cubic system, the edge length a would be equal to the interatomic distance. But in a more complex structure, like a rhombohedral, perhaps a is not the distance between atoms. Hmm, but that's unlikely because the structure is built from the unit cells, where a is the edge.

Wait, maybe the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure isn't the same as a. Let me think. For a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edges, so a is the nearest neighbor distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor might not lie along the edge.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the unit cell. In a rhombohedral, the atoms are at the corners and perhaps the centers of the faces. Wait, no, perhaps it's a primitive unit cell.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think differently. Let me try to find a formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

I found a formula from a reference: For a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So that's what I used earlier.

So plugging in the values:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*cos30°) = sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = sqrt(3 + 3√3)

Wait, 3√3 is approximately 5.196, so denominator is sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.8628.

So d =10 /2.8628 ≈3.495 Ang. But the options are 9.08, 8.95, etc. So I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, maybe I should be using the inverse formula. Because d is the interplanar distance, and the given interatomic distance is a=10 Ang. But perhaps the formula is 1/d² = ... which would then make d larger. Hmm.

Wait, no, because the formula I used gives d as the interplanar distance. If that is 3.49, but the options are around 9, perhaps I inverted the formula.

Wait, another approach: let's compute 1/d² = (3)/(100) - 3*(1 + cos30°)/100.

Wait, earlier, I tried this approach and got a negative value, which can't be right. So perhaps this formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = ( (h² +k² +l²) )/(a²) - ( (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cosθ) ) / (a² )

So with h=k=l=1,

1/d² = (3)/(100) - (3)(1 + (√3)/2)/100.

So compute each part:

3/100 = 0.03.

1 + cos30° = 1 + √3/2 ≈1 +0.866=1.866.

So 3 * 1.866 =5.598.

5.598 /100 =0.05598.

So 1/d² =0.03 - 0.05598 = -0.02598.

Negative, which is impossible. So that can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters and the angles.

Wait, another formula I found is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But in our case, α=β=γ=30°, so:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*( (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 2*( 3*(√3/2) ) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Which is the same as before, so d ≈3.495.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between the atoms along the edge of the rhombohedron. So in a rhombohedral structure, the edge length is a, but the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) might be a√ (something). Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges, so a is the interatomic distance. But then the calculation I did gives d ≈3.49, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the reciprocal of d, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the question is about the distance between the planes (111), but I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, I found a resource online that says the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is what I used. So why is the answer not matching any of the given options?

Wait, let me compute again.

a=10, θ=30°, hkl=111.

h² +k² + l² =3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ =2*(3)*cos(30)=6*(√3/2)=3√3≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.862.

So d=10/2.862≈3.495 Ang.

But the options are all around 9 Ang. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a. Maybe I'm confusing interatomic distance with the edge length a.

In a simple cubic structure, a is the edge length and the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two nearest atoms in the structure. For example, in a face-centered cubic (FCC) or body-centered cubic (BCC), the nearest neighbor distance isn't equal to a.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance might be a√(something). Let me think about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) - 2(cos alpha cos beta cos gamma) + ... ). No, that seems complex.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, and the angles between them are θ. So the unit vectors can be represented as:

a_vec = a (1, 0, 0)
b_vec = a (cosθ, sinθ, 0)
c_vec = a (cosθ, (cosφ)/sinθ, (sqrt(1 - cos²φ - (cosφ sinθ)^2 ))/sinθ )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so perhaps this simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps the relation between the unit cell edge length and the interatomic distance is given by another formula. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, but the interplanar distance comes out to be about 3.49 Ang, which is much smaller than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming a is 10 Ang.

Wait, but the question says interatomic distance is 10 Ang. That would mean a=10 Ang. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the volume formula and the plane's equation.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal lattice vectors. The distance d is related to the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a)(1, 0, 0)
b2 = (2π/a)(cosθ, sinθ, 0)
b3 = (2π/a)(cosθ, (cosθ)/sinθ, (sqrt(1 - cos²θ - (cos²θ)/(sin²θ)) )/(sinθ) )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe it's better to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the volume of the unit cell. The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a³ sin α sin beta sin gamma / (sqrt(1 + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma )) )

Wait, but in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so:

V = a³ sin^3 30° / sqrt(1 + 2 (cos30)^3 - 3 (cos30)^2 )

Compute this:

sin30=0.5, cos30=√3/2≈0.866.

So V = a³ (0.5)^3 / sqrt( 1 + 2*(0.866)^3 - 3*(0.866)^2 )

Compute denominator inside sqrt:

Compute (0.866)^3≈0.866 * 0.866 *0.866= approx 0.6495.

So 2*(0.6495)=1.299.

Next, 3*(0.866)^2=3*(0.75)=2.25.

So denominator inside sqrt:1 +1.299 -2.25= (2.299) -2.25=0.049.

sqrt(0.049)=approx 0.2214.

So V = (a³ * 0.125) / 0.2214 ≈ a³ *0.564.

So V ≈0.564 a³.

But I'm not sure how this helps me with d_hkl.

Wait, another formula I found: the interplanar distance can be calculated using:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is what I used earlier. So why isn't this giving me an answer matching the options? Because the options are about 9 Ang, but according to this, it's about 3.49.

Wait, unless I made a calculation error. Let me re-calculate sqrt(8.196).

Wait, 2.86^2=8.1796.

2.862^2= (2.86 +0.002)^2= 2.86^2 + 2*2.86*0.002 + 0.002^2=8.1796 +0.01144 +0.000004≈8.19104.

Which is close to 8.196. So 2.862^2=8.191, which is less than 8.196.

So 2.862^2=8.191 → difference of 8.196-8.191=0.005.

So approximately, sqrt(8.196)=2.862 + (0.005)/(2*2.862).

So 0.005/(5.724)≈0.000874.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.862874.

So d=10/2.862874≈3.492 Ang.

So why is this not matching any of the options? The options are in the 8-10 range.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a but something else. Let me think: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms along the (111) plane, which would be different than a.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the interatomic distance is generally the nearest neighbor distance, which is along the edges in a simple cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor might be along a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance along the (111) plane's direction.

But I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach is to compute the reciprocal of the plane. The reciprocal lattice vectors are b1, b2, b3. The distance d is given by 1/d = |n · (b1 + b2 + b3)| / (2π), where n is the normal vector to the plane.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. I'm not making much progress.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the answer options and see which one makes sense.

Wait, let's compute 10 / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1+1+1)*cos 30 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

Hmm, but the options are all around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in theta.

Wait, wait a second. The formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the lattice vectors are 30°, but wait, in the formula, is it the angle between the vectors or the angle in the unit cell?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the angles. For instance, in some systems, the angles are given as the angles between the edges of the unit cell as viewed in a certain way. Let me think.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the lattice vectors (a, b, c) are all equal to θ. So the angle between a and b is θ, which is 30°, same between a and c, and b and c.

So the formula I used should be correct.

Wait, but maybe it's the supplementary angle. Cos(150°) is -√3/2. But that would make the denominator larger, making d smaller, which isn't the case.

Wait, no, because 30° is acute, which would bring the vectors closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use cos(60°), but the given angle is 30°.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires the angle between the edges of the unit cell as in the face angles, not the angles between the vectors. Wait, maybe I'm getting the angles wrong.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck here. All the calculations point to d≈3.49 Ang, but the options are nowhere near that. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula or in the interpretation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for d is a divided by the square root of (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but wait, perhaps I should sum the terms differently.

Wait, wait, in the denominator, perhaps it's (h² +k² + l²) + 2hk cosα + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma.

In our case, all angles are 30°, so:

denominator =3 + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 )

=3 +6*(√3/2)=3+3√3≈3+5.196=8.196.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is a² = (interatomic distance)². So if a=10, then interatomic distance is 10. But we need to compute d, which is much smaller.

Wait, but in the options, the interplanar distance is much larger than the interatomic distance. That would be impossible because the planes are closer than the atoms—no, wait, no, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, which can be larger than the interatomic distance.

Wait, but in a cubic system, the (111) planes are spaced at a√3/√2. For a=10, that's about 7.07 Ang. But our calculation for rhombohedral gives 3.49, which is smaller than that. So perhaps the given options are for a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but the interplanar distance for the (100) plane.

Wait, if the (100) plane's interplanar distance is 10 Ang, then for (111) it's smaller. But the options are all around 9, which is larger than 10.

Hmm, I'm confused. I think I've reached the limit of what I can figure out. Perhaps I should choose the option that matches my calculated value, but since it's not there, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait maybe I inverted the formula. Instead of d = a / sqrt(...), perhaps it's d = a * sqrt(...). Let me see.

If I calculate a multiplied by sqrt(8.196)/1, but that would make d=10 * 2.862=28.6, which is way too big.

No, that's not correct. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are the face angles, not the angles between vectors.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the edges as viewed from a certain direction, which are larger than the angles between the vectors.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the edges can be different. For example, the angle between a and b vectors is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma.

But in this problem, all three are 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the angle between the planes. Hmm, but that's not relevant here.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess. The options are A:9.08, B:8.95, C:9.54, D:10.05.

Wait, when I calculated 10 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49, but perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.862≈28.62, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the denominator is (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

Wait, let's try that.

So denominator =3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so sqrt is imaginary. No, that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But for our case, 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So that's impossible.

So I don't think that's the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong. Let me think, another source suggests that for a general crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1/√( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1/a^2) - 2(hk/h_a^2 + hl/h_b^2 + kl/h_c^2) + (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)(cos α cos beta cos gamma)/(a^2 sin alpha sin beta sin gamma) ) )

Hmm, that's getting too complicated, and I'm not sure I can apply it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which brings us back to the same point.

So perhaps the issue is that the given interatomic distance is not a, but perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a multiplied by a factor.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral structure is a*sqrt( (1 + 2 cosθ )/(something) ).

Wait, for a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. For a face-centered cubic (FCC), it's a√2/2. For a hexagonal close-packed (HCP), it's a√3/2.

But in a rhombohedral, it's more complicated. Let's model this.

In a rhombohedral system, the structure can be seen as a stacking of rhombohedrons. The nearest neighbor would be along the edges, so the interatomic distance would be a. But if the structure is such that the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedron, then the nearest neighbor would be the edge length, a.

But perhaps in this problem, the interatomic distance is not the edge length. Let me think: perhaps the edge length is a, and the interatomic distance is along a different direction.

Wait, for example, in a simple cubic system, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so interatomic distance is a. In a body-centered cubic (BCC), the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, so distance is a√2/2.

But in a rhombohedral (primitive) structure, the nearest neighbor might be along the edge, so a is the interatomic distance.

But then the earlier calculation stands, which doesn't match any given options.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, but the problem is asking for the interplanar distance for a (111) plane, which has a higher d-spacing.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 3.49, which is much smaller than a.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the (111) plane's d-spacing is larger than a. How? Because in a cubic system, (111) d is a√3/√2≈1.2247a, which for a=10, is about 12.247. But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, but in our case, the structure isn't cubic, so the d-spacing would be different.

This is getting frustrating. I think I'm stuck, but perhaps I should go with the calculation I have, even though it doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the options are around 9 Ang, which is close to a=10. So perhaps I should think of a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to a face-centered cubic (FCC) system, but no, the question states it's rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, perhaps I should use the volume formula.

Wait, the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

In our case, θ=30°, so cosθ=√3/2≈0.866.

So,

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute each term:

3*(0.866)^2=3*(0.75)=2.25.

2*(0.866)^3=2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So,

Inside sqrt:1 -2.25 +1.299= (1 +1.299) -2.25=2.299-2.25=0.049.

sqrt(0.049)=0.2214.

So,

V= a^3 * 0.2214.

But how does this help with d_hkl?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance can be written in terms of the volume and the plane indices.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, and the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be the case for a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1+1+1)*cos(30) )^{-1}.

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the options and my calculations, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. But I can't find an alternative approach, so I'll have to go with the calculation, even if it doesn't match the options.

But the options don't have 3.49, so probably I made a mistake. Wait, another thought: perhaps the given angles are the angles in the unit cell, but the formula uses the angles between the vectors, which would be 180° - 30°=150°. Because in the unit cell, the angles between the edges could be the supplementary angle.

Wait, that would make cosθ = cos(150°)= -√3/2≈-0.866.

Let me try that.

So, denominator inside the sqrt becomes:

3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866) =3 - 5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so sqrt(-2.196) is imaginary. That doesn't make sense.

So that can't be right.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would give for our case:

3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So again, invalid.

So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which in our case, all angles are 30°, so:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*( (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ) )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.49.

Same as before.

So I think I'm confident that the formula is correct. Therefore, perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But since the options are given, perhaps I should recalculate.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes, not between the vectors.

Wait, no, the formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors.

I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should choose the closest option, even though it's not correct, but that's not a valid approach.

Wait, unless I made a calculation mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, 3 +6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.8628.

10/2.8628=3.492.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula and it's 1/d² = ..., so perhaps d is 10*sqrt(8.196)/3.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d = ... which would make d larger.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is (interplanar distance) = a * [ (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ]^{-1/2}.

Which is what I used earlier.

Therefore, unless I'm missing a critical factor, I think the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Ang, which is not among the options.

Hmm. But looking at the options, the closest is option B, 8.95, but that's about 3 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 / sqrt( (3) + 2*(3)*cos(60) ).

Wait, cos(60)=0.5. So 3+6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which, for θ=30°, gives 3 - 6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196, which is impossible.

So no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-θ).

Which would be 3 +6 cos(150)=3 +6*(-√3/2)=3-5.196= -2.196. Again, invalid.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. I have to conclude that the correct answer, according to the formula, is approximately 3.49 Ang, which is not an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = [ (a^2 (b^2 + c^2 + a^2 )) / (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha) ) ]^(1/2)

But since a=b=c=10, and all angles are 30°, this becomes:

d= [ (10^2 (10^2 +10^2 +10^2 )) / (3 + 2*3*cos30 )) ]^(1/2)

= [ (100 * 300 ) / (3 + 5.196) ]^(1/2)

= [30000 / 8.196 ]^(1/2) → 30000/8.196≈3660. So sqrt(3660)≈60.5.

Which is way larger than the options. So that's not it.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think I have to conclude that the answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C)9.54.

Wait, let me compute what 10 Ang / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) would give option C.

What would make d≈9.54?

d=9.54=10 / sqrt( ... )

So sqrt(...)=10/9.54≈1.048.

So denominator inside sqrt is (1.048)^2≈1.098.

So,

3 +6*(0.866)=8.196.

But 8.196 is much larger than 1.098. So that's impossible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps someone else made a mistake, but I can't figure it out. So considering all, I'll have to go with my calculation, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula in terms of the dot product. For a rhombohedral structure, the plane's normal vector is (h,k,l). The distance d to the plane can be found using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1= (2π/a) (1, 0, 0)
b2= (2π/a) (cosθ, sinθ, 0)
b3= (2π/a) (cosθ, cosθ/sinθ, sqrt(1 - cos²θ - (cos²θ)/(sin²θ )) / sinθ )

But perhaps this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance d is given by:

d = 1 / ( (h b1 + k b2 + l b3) · n )

Where n is the unit normal vector. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation I made, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are 60°, but the question states 30°.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer based on the formula is approximately 3.49 Ang, but since it's not an option, I suspect a mistake in the problem statement. However, considering the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option A)9.08.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
\]
\[
2(hk + hl + kl) \cos 30^\circ = 2(1 + 1 + 1)(0.866) = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the square root
\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.8628
\]

### Step 4: Final calculation
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.8628} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 5: Comparing with the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests either a misunderstanding of the problem or an issue with the given options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), and none of the options are valid.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the provided options, and assuming the problem intends for one of the options to be correct, the closest plausible answer is **A) 9.08 Å**, though this does not align with the derived formula.
