Okay, so I need to figure out which starting materials A and B would give the products shown when treated with different reducing agents. Let me think about the reactions and what's happening here.

The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, wait, no. Let me check the question again. Oh, right, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-compound, and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-compound. Or wait, noâ€”maybe I mixed that up. Let me re-read.

The question says for A: A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl... and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... So each starting material is giving a different diastereomer or enantiomer depending on the reducing agent. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters and ketones. BH3 is usually used for ketone reductions as well, but perhaps in a different way, like in the formation of alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition. Or wait, in the context of ketones, both would reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol. Wait, but the product here is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the starting material structure.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me try drawing it. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The 2H-pyran-2-one means that the carbonyl is at position 2. So the ring has an oxygen, a ketone group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the product is a cyclic ketone with substituents. Now, how would this form from a starting material? It's likely that the starting material is a ketone or an ester that undergoes some kind of ring-forming reaction during reduction.

Wait, LiBH4 is used for reductions, perhaps of ketals or acetals? Or perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal formation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. When reduced, the acetal would break down. Or perhaps it's a cyclic ketone or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps these are cases of the reduction of an alpha-keto ester. Let me think about the possibilities.

Wait, the starting materials are given as options. Let's look at the options. They all are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The configuration is either R or S for each. So the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents.

So the structure of the starting material is pentanoic acid where at position 5 (since it's pentanoic, the carboxylic acid is at position 1), there's an isobutoxy group and an oxo group (keto group). So the structure would be something like:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-isobutyl, but wait, let me get the structure right. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But wait, more accurately, the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [since it's 3-ethyl]
Position 5: C=O and O-isobutyl (since 5 is the last carbon before COOH, wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, numbering from the carboxylic acid end, position 1 is COOH, then position 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no, I think I have the numbering wrong. For pentanoic acid, the COOH is at carbon 1. So carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH2, carbon 4 is CH2, carbon 5 is CH3. But in this case, the substituents are at position 3 and 5. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C*(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl, but wait that doesn't make sense because position 5 is the last carbon. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is: COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl. No, wait, position 5 is the same as position 5 in the chain. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (so ethyl group)
Position 4: CO-O-isobutyl (since it's 5-oxo, but wait, the substituents are at 5, which is the same as position 4 in the chain? Hmm, maybe the substituents are on the same carbon, which is position 5 (i.e., the same as the fourth carbon from the COOH end). Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is 5-oxo-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)=O

Wait, but that would make it a diketone, which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps it's a keto ester. So perhaps it's (COOH)CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CO-O-iBu.

Wait, but that would have the carbonyl at position 5, which is the same as the fourth carbon from the COOH. Hmm.

Let me think about the reaction. So when you treat this with a reducing agent like LiBH4 or BH3, what happens? Maybe the ester group is being reduced.

Wait, LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, like RCOOR', then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to RCH2OH and R'OH. But wait, that depends on the specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a ketone and an ester group, and the reduction affects that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or something that can form a ring upon reduction. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol and a ketone, perhaps. Or maybe it's the result of a Robinson annulation or some other cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acetal that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let's think about that. Gamma-keto esters, when treated with a reducing agent, can undergo reduction of the carbonyl group to an alcohol. But if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, then reduction would give a secondary alcohol, and perhaps that would undergo cyclization to form a ring.

Wait, if the starting material is something like:

RCO-O-R'

Upon treatment with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the ester group would be reduced to an alcohol. So RCO-O-R' would become RCH2-O-R'. But wait, the structure of the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let's say the structure is:

RCO-COOR'

Then, upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to RCH2-COOR' ? No, wait, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to RCH2-O-R' and the ketone to RCH2-O-R' as well.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. For example, RC(O)CH2COOR'. No, wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or an acetal.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So maybe the starting material is a ketone and an alcohol that can form a five or six-membered ring upon hemiacetal formation.

Wait, the product is a pyran, which has six members, so the formation is likely a six-membered ring.

So perhaps the starting material is a ketone and a nearby alcohol group. Upon reduction, maybe the ketone is converted to a diol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, more likely to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So if the starting material has a ketone, treatment with LiBH4 would yield a secondary alcohol. Then, maybe that secondary alcohol and another OH group could form an acetal or a hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is an oxygen-containing ring with a ketone. So maybe the reduction is of an ester group to an alcohol, which then forms the cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal that upon reduction gives the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and LiBH4 is used to reduce it. But LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce aromatic ketones unless they're activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example:

O
||
R-CO-O-R'

When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester group to an alcohol. So RCO-O-R' becomes RCH2-O-R', and the ketone becomes RCH2-OH.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction leading to the formation of the product.

The product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ketone or ester that cyclizes upon reduction.

Wait, let me think about the product structure. It's a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So it's a tetrahydropyran ring (like glucose but six-membered) with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the ring is O-C-C-C-C-O-C=O, but arranged in a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe it's more like:

Positions:
1: O
2: C=O
3: CH2
4: CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl)
5: CH2
6: CH2

Wait, not exactly, but the ring has the ketone at position 2, and substituents at position 4.

So how could this form from a starting material? One possibility is that the starting material is a diol with a ketone group, which can form the ring via hemiacetal formation. Or perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone that undergoes cyclization upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is an acyclic ketone that undergoes a ring-forming reaction upon reduction. But LiBH4 is a reducing agent, so it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group. When reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol, and then the two alcohol groups can form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but in the case of LiBH4, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketal. No, because the product is a pyranone, which is a more oxidized structure.

Hmm, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let's say the structure is:

RCO-O-R'

Upon treatment with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to an alcohol group. So RCO-O-R' becomes RCH2-O-R'.

Wait, but then where is the ketone? Oh, wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like:

RC(O)CH2COOR'

Then, when LiBH4 is added, it would reduce the ester to RCH2CH2OH, and the ketone to RCH2CH2OH as well. Hmm, but perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. Hemicetals form from aldehydes or ketones and alcohols. So perhaps the starting material is a ketone and an alcohol that are adjacent, allowing the formation of a six-membered ring upon reaction.

But the starting material in the options is a pentanoic acid derivative. So perhaps the pentanoic acid has an ester group which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, let's think about the starting material being 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)=O

Wait, that seems like a keto ester. So it's a gamma-keto ester because the ketone is at position 4 (if the COOH is position 1) and the ester is at position 5. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Position 5: C(O-O-iBu)=O

Wait, but position 5 is the same as position 4 in the chain, so perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)=O

No, that can't be, because the chain is five carbons (pentanoic acid). So, the carbonyl groups are on the same carbon? That would make it a geminal di-ketone, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group at position 3 and an ester group (CO-O-isobutyl) at position 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-COOH (positions 1 and 2)
CH(CH2CH2CH3) at position 3
CO-O-iBu at position 5.

Wait, but the numbering would be 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH2CH2CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CO-O-iBu).

Wait, but that would put the ester at position 5. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu

So, the starting material is (R or S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, no, because the ester is at 5, which is a carbonyl group. So the structure would have a ketone (oxo) at position 5? No, the compound is 5-oxo-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid. Wait, can a compound have both an oxo and an ester group on the same carbon?

Wait, that seems unlikely. Because the oxo group is a ketone, and the ester would be O-CO-O-R. So if the same carbon has both, that would imply a structure like:

R-CO-O-R'

But that's an ester, not a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, meaning the ketone is at position 4 (gamma to the ester).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(OH)-CO-O-iBu

No, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, but the starting material is pentanoic acid. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions and stereochemistry.

The product is (R) or (S) configuration at the 4-ethyl group. The starting materials are either R or S. So the configuration in the starting material would influence the configuration in the product.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. But no, the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have a ketone or something that can form a ketone upon reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester. But upon reduction, the ester would open up.

Wait, when you reduce an ester with LiBH4, you get a primary alcohol. For example, RCOOR' would become RCH2OH and R'OH. But that doesn't seem to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal or ketal, which upon reduction would form a diol, and that could cyclize into the pyranone.

Wait, another approach: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has five carbons (since it's 2H-pyran, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed from a five-membered ring, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative that upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with an ester group. If the ester is reduced, perhaps it forms a diol which can cyclize.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with an ester group. When treated with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester is reduced to an alcohol. Then, with the presence of a ketone group, maybe an intramolecular cyclization occurs to form the pyran ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, but that would be a gamma-keto ester, because the ketone is at position 4 relative to the ester.

When this is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to an alcohol. So, the COOR group becomes CH2OH. The ketone (C=O) would be reduced to CH2OH as well. So, we'd have two alcohol groups: perhaps on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but then how would that form a cyclic structure? Maybe the two alcohols can form a ring via hemiacetal formation, but that would require an aldehyde or ketone in the same molecule, which is not the case if both are reduced.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the reaction conditions again.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters to alcohols. So, the ester group (COOR') becomes CH2OH. The ketone (if present) would also be reduced to an alcohol.

So, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, the reaction would produce a diol. Then, perhaps the diol can undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol. Then, the diol can form a five or six-membered ring via hemiacetal formation.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring, so the diol must be in a position that allows for a six-membered transition state.

So, the diol would have two adjacent -OH groups, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is formed on carbons separated by a certain distance, allowing cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction would open up and then form a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the product. The product is either (R) or (S) configuration. The starting materials (A and B) have either R or S configuration, which would influence the product's configuration.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material's configuration. For example, if the ketone is prochiral and we reduce it with a reagent that can induce asymmetry, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

But in this case, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which would have a certain configuration. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, and the ester becomes an alcohol as well.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which is more oxidized than an alcohol. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the reduction of the starting material forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which can then cyclize to form the pyranone.

So, the starting material is an alpha-keto ester: RCOCH2COOR'. Upon reduction with LiBH4, both the ketone and ester are reduced to alcohols: RCH2CH2-OH and R'OH.

But then, how does the ring form? Maybe the two alcohols can form a hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which can then form the pyran ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then forms the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon oxidation, forms the pyranone.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this the wrong way around. Let's try to think about the product as the result of a reduction.

The product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester that upon reduction would form a diol, which can then form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester). Upon reduction with LiBH4, the lactone would open up to form a diol, which then forms the pyranone upon dehydration or some other process.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry and how the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) affect the product's configuration.

Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Typically, BH3 is used for the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, but in the presence of other conditions, it can also reduce ketones to secondary alcohols.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple reduction but involves other steps, like cyclization. So, the starting material is an ester and a ketone, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the diol doesn't reduce the ketone but forms the ring structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon treatment with a reducing agent forms a diol, and the diol then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a gamma-keto ester. For example, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-R
|
CH2-C-O-R'
|
CH2-COOH

Wait, upon treatment with a reducing agent, the acetal would break down, and the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that would form the pyranone.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal, so the starting material must have a carbonyl group and an alcohol group in positions that allow for cyclization. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto alcohol.

So, the structure would be something like:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-COOH

But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a 3-keto alcohol, which upon reduction gives a diol, which can form the ring.

Wait, but the starting material in the options is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group and an ester.

Hmm.

Maybe I should think about the reaction using each reducing agent.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. So, the ester group (COOR') in the starting material would be reduced to a CH2OH group.

If the starting material also has a ketone group (C=O), LiBH4 would reduce that to a CH2OH as well, giving a diol.

So, the starting material (options A and B) would have both a ketone and an ester. Upon treatment with LiBH4, both would be reduced to alcohols, creating two hydroxyl groups.

Then, perhaps the diol would undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which has a ketone. So that would mean that one of the alcohol groups is oxidized back to a ketone, which doesn't make sense under reducing conditions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction opens up and reforms into the pyranone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that's more about forming enones.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone remains as a ketone. But that doesn't fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has an ethyl group at position 4, which is two carbons away from the oxygen.

So, the starting material must have the ethyl group in a position that, when reduced and cyclized, ends up at position 4.

Looking at the starting material options, they are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the ethyl is at position 3, and the ester is at position 5.

So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu

So, when treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the ester (CO-O-iBu) would be reduced to a CH2OH group. The ketone (5-oxo) would also be reduced to a CH2OH group.

Wait, but that would give a diol. Then, perhaps the diol would form a cyclic structure via intramolecular hemiacetal formation, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of the ester and ketone gives a diol, which then loses a water molecule to form the cyclic ketone. But under reducing conditions, that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the ester is not the functional group being reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl group is being reduced, and the ester remains.

Wait, but LiBH4 typically reduces esters. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a ketone and an ester, and only the ketone is reduced, leaving the ester intact. Then, the resulting diol could form the ring.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate reduction of the gamma-keto ester. LiBH4 can perform conjugate reductions, so maybe it reduces the ester in a way that forms the pyran ring.

Wait, conjugate reduction of a gamma-keto ester would add hydrogen across the conjugated double bond, but I'm not sure if that leads to ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester, and upon reduction, the ring opens and reforms.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

The product from A is (R) configuration, and from B is (S). So if the starting material A leads to R, and B leads to S, then the starting materials must have opposite configurations.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S, and option C has A as S and B as R.

So, if the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, then the correct option would have A as R and B as S, or vice versa.

But how does the configuration of the starting material influence the product's configuration?

Assuming the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with an R configuration, upon reduction, the configuration of the resulting diol would depend on the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration due to retention or inversion during the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the same configuration. For example, if the starting material is (R), upon reduction, the new chiral center forms (R) as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemical outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is retained in the product, so if A is R, the product is R, and if B is S, the product is S.

Looking back at the question, A uses LiBH4 and gives R, and B uses BH3 and gives S.

Wait, but BH3 is a different reducing agent. Wait, noâ€”BH3 is typically used in hydroboration, but in some cases, it can be used for ketone reductions, perhaps leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both used for ketone reductions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce esters, while BH3 is usually used in more specific conditions, like hydroboration.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with BH3 is not a simple reduction but a hydroboration-oxidation, but the product is a ketone. That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the product isn't from a simple reduction but a more complex reaction like an aldol addition or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of an ester to an alcohol, which then undergoes an intramolecular oxidation to form the pyranone. But that seems unlikely under reducing conditions.

I think I'm stuck on the exact reaction mechanism. Let me try to think of the possible answer based on the options and the product configurations.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S)
B) A and B are both (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

The products from A and B have (R) and (S) configurations, respectively. So the starting materials must have opposite configurations if their reactions lead to opposite product configurations.

If the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product, then the correct option would be D or C.

Assuming that the configuration is retained, then if A is R, product is R; if B is S, product is S. So the correct option would be D.

But wait, when you reduce a chiral center, does the configuration change?

In the case of reducing a ketone (which is planar) to an alcohol, the configuration of the new chiral center is determined by the reagent and the starting material's configuration. Wait, no, because the ketone isn't chiral. So, perhaps the chiral center is in the starting material, and its configuration influences the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration via retention or inversion.

Wait, perhaps when the ester is reduced, the configuration at the adjacent chiral center determines the product's configuration.

But I'm not certain. Looking back, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reducing agents are influencing the stereochemistry of the ring formation.

Wait, another thought: The starting material has a stereochemistry at the 3-ethyl group. When the ester is reduced, the configuration at that center influences the product's configuration.

If the starting material A is (R), then the product from A (with LiBH4) is (R). Similarly, starting material B is (S), product from B is (S).

So, the correct option would be D, where A is R and B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) that yield the products (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one when treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom and a ketone group at position 2. The ethyl group is at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product is either (R) or (S), depending on the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols.
   - **BH3**: Typically used for hydroboration-oxidation, but in this context, it likely reduces the ester to an alcohol while influencing the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Starting Material**:
   - The starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with an ethyl group at position 3 and an ester group at position 5. The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S) influences the stereochemistry of the product.

4. **Reaction Mechanism**:
   - The ester group in the starting material is reduced to an alcohol. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the configuration of the product. If the starting material is (R), the product will also be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

5. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would result in both products being (S), which is inconsistent with the question.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). This would result in both products being (R), which is also inconsistent with the question.
   - **Option C**: A is (S) and B is (R). This would result in the product from A being (S) and the product from B being (R), which is consistent with the question.
   - **Option D**: A is (R) and B is (S). This would result in the product from A being (R) and the product from B being (S), which is also consistent with the question.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material directly dictates the stereochemistry of the product. Since the question specifies that A produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and B produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to figure out which starting materials A and B would give the products shown when treated with different reducing agents. Let me think about the reactions and what's happening here.

The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, wait, no. Let me check the question again. Oh, right, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-compound, and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-compound. Or wait, noâ€”maybe I mixed that up. Let me re-read.

The question says for A: A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl... and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... So each starting material is giving a different diastereomer or enantiomer depending on the reducing agent. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters and ketones. BH3 is usually used for ketone reductions as well, but perhaps in a different way, like in the formation of alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition. Or wait, in the context of ketones, both would reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol. Wait, but the product here is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the starting material structure.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me try drawing it. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The 2H-pyran-2-one means that the carbonyl is at position 2. So the ring has an oxygen, a ketone group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the product is a cyclic ketone with substituents. Now, how would this form from a starting material? It's likely that the starting material is a ketone or an ester that undergoes some kind of ring-forming reaction during reduction.

Wait, LiBH4 is used for reductions, perhaps of ketals or acetals? Or perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal formation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. When reduced, the acetal would break down. Or perhaps it's a cyclic ketone or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps these are cases of the reduction of an alpha-keto ester. Let me think about the possibilities.

Wait, the starting materials are given as options. Let's look at the options. They all are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The configuration is either R or S for each. So the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents.

So the structure of the starting material is pentanoic acid where at position 5 (since it's pentanoic, the carboxylic acid is at position 1), there's an isobutoxy group and an oxo group (keto group). So the structure would be something like:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-isobutyl, but wait, let me get the structure right. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But wait, more accurately, the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [since it's 3-ethyl]
Position 5: C=O and O-isobutyl (since 5 is the last carbon before COOH, wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, numbering from the carboxylic acid end, position 1 is COOH, then position 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no, I think I have the numbering wrong. For pentanoic acid, the COOH is at carbon 1. So carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH2, carbon 4 is CH2, carbon 5 is CH3. But in this case, the substituents are at position 3 and 5. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C*(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl, but wait that doesn't make sense because position 5 is the last carbon. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is: COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl. No, wait, position 5 is the same as position 5 in the chain. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (so ethyl group)
Position 4: CO-O-isobutyl (since it's 5-oxo, but wait, the substituents are at 5, which is the same as position 4 in the chain? Hmm, maybe the substituents are on the same carbon, which is position 5 (i.e., the same as the fourth carbon from the COOH end). Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is 5-oxo-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)=O

Wait, but that would make it a diketone, which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps it's a keto ester. So perhaps it's (COOH)CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CO-O-iBu.

Wait, but that would have the carbonyl at position 5, which is the same as the fourth carbon from the COOH. Hmm.

Let me think about the reaction. So when you treat this with a reducing agent like LiBH4 or BH3, what happens? Maybe the ester group is being reduced.

Wait, LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, like RCOOR', then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to RCH2OH and R'OH. But wait, that depends on the specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a ketone and an ester group, and the reduction affects that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or something that can form a ring upon reduction. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol and a ketone, perhaps. Or maybe it's the result of a Robinson annulation or some other cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acetal that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let's think about that. Gamma-keto esters, when treated with a reducing agent, can undergo reduction of the carbonyl group to an alcohol. But if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, then reduction would give a secondary alcohol, and perhaps that would undergo cyclization to form a ring.

Wait, if the starting material is something like:

RCO-O-R'

Upon treatment with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the ester group would be reduced to an alcohol. So RCO-O-R' would become RCH2-O-R'. But wait, the structure of the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let's say the structure is:

RCO-COOR'

Then, upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to RCH2-COOR' ? No, wait, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to RCH2-O-R' and the ketone to RCH2-O-R' as well.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. For example, RC(O)CH2COOR'. No, wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or an acetal.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So maybe the starting material is a ketone and an alcohol that can form a five or six-membered ring upon hemiacetal formation.

Wait, the product is a pyran, which has six members, so the formation is likely a six-membered ring.

So perhaps the starting material is a ketone and a nearby alcohol group. Upon reduction, maybe the ketone is converted to a diol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, more likely to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So if the starting material has a ketone, treatment with LiBH4 would yield a secondary alcohol. Then, maybe that secondary alcohol and another OH group could form an acetal or a hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is an oxygen-containing ring with a ketone. So maybe the reduction is of an ester group to an alcohol, which then forms the cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal that upon reduction gives the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and LiBH4 is used to reduce it. But LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce aromatic ketones unless they're activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example:

O
||
R-CO-O-R'

When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester group to an alcohol. So RCO-O-R' becomes RCH2-O-R', and the ketone becomes RCH2-OH.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction leading to the formation of the product.

The product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ketone or ester that cyclizes upon reduction.

Wait, let me think about the product structure. It's a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So it's a tetrahydropyran ring (like glucose but six-membered) with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the ring is O-C-C-C-C-O-C=O, but arranged in a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe it's more like:

Positions:
1: O
2: C=O
3: CH2
4: CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl)
5: CH2
6: CH2

Wait, not exactly, but the ring has the ketone at position 2, and substituents at position 4.

So how could this form from a starting material? One possibility is that the starting material is a diol with a ketone group, which can form the ring via hemiacetal formation. Or perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone that undergoes cyclization upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is an acyclic ketone that undergoes a ring-forming reaction upon reduction. But LiBH4 is a reducing agent, so it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group. When reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol, and then the two alcohol groups can form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but in the case of LiBH4, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketal. No, because the product is a pyranone, which is a more oxidized structure.

Hmm, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let's say the structure is:

RCO-O-R'

Upon treatment with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to an alcohol group. So RCO-O-R' becomes RCH2-O-R'.

Wait, but then where is the ketone? Oh, wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like:

RC(O)CH2COOR'

Then, when LiBH4 is added, it would reduce the ester to RCH2CH2OH, and the ketone to RCH2CH2OH as well. Hmm, but perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. Hemicetals form from aldehydes or ketones and alcohols. So perhaps the starting material is a ketone and an alcohol that are adjacent, allowing the formation of a six-membered ring upon reaction.

But the starting material in the options is a pentanoic acid derivative. So perhaps the pentanoic acid has an ester group which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, let's think about the starting material being 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)=O

Wait, that seems like a keto ester. So it's a gamma-keto ester because the ketone is at position 4 (if the COOH is position 1) and the ester is at position 5. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Position 5: C(O-O-iBu)=O

Wait, but position 5 is the same as position 4 in the chain, so perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)=O

No, that can't be, because the chain is five carbons (pentanoic acid). So, the carbonyl groups are on the same carbon? That would make it a geminal di-ketone, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group at position 3 and an ester group (CO-O-isobutyl) at position 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-COOH (positions 1 and 2)
CH(CH2CH2CH3) at position 3
CO-O-iBu at position 5.

Wait, but the numbering would be 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH2CH2CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CO-O-iBu).

Wait, but that would put the ester at position 5. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu

So, the starting material is (R or S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, no, because the ester is at 5, which is a carbonyl group. So the structure would have a ketone (oxo) at position 5? No, the compound is 5-oxo-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid. Wait, can a compound have both an oxo and an ester group on the same carbon?

Wait, that seems unlikely. Because the oxo group is a ketone, and the ester would be O-CO-O-R. So if the same carbon has both, that would imply a structure like:

R-CO-O-R'

But that's an ester, not a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, meaning the ketone is at position 4 (gamma to the ester).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(OH)-CO-O-iBu

No, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, but the starting material is pentanoic acid. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions and stereochemistry.

The product is (R) or (S) configuration at the 4-ethyl group. The starting materials are either R or S. So the configuration in the starting material would influence the configuration in the product.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. But no, the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have a ketone or something that can form a ketone upon reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester. But upon reduction, the ester would open up.

Wait, when you reduce an ester with LiBH4, you get a primary alcohol. For example, RCOOR' would become RCH2OH and R'OH. But that doesn't seem to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal or ketal, which upon reduction would form a diol, and that could cyclize into the pyranone.

Wait, another approach: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has five carbons (since it's 2H-pyran, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed from a five-membered ring, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative that upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with an ester group. If the ester is reduced, perhaps it forms a diol which can cyclize.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with an ester group. When treated with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester is reduced to an alcohol. Then, with the presence of a ketone group, maybe an intramolecular cyclization occurs to form the pyran ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, but that would be a gamma-keto ester, because the ketone is at position 4 relative to the ester.

When this is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to an alcohol. So, the COOR group becomes CH2OH. The ketone (C=O) would be reduced to CH2OH as well. So, we'd have two alcohol groups: perhaps on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but then how would that form a cyclic structure? Maybe the two alcohols can form a ring via hemiacetal formation, but that would require an aldehyde or ketone in the same molecule, which is not the case if both are reduced.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the reaction conditions again.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters to alcohols. So, the ester group (COOR') becomes CH2OH. The ketone (if present) would also be reduced to an alcohol.

So, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, the reaction would produce a diol. Then, perhaps the diol can undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol. Then, the diol can form a five or six-membered ring via hemiacetal formation.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring, so the diol must be in a position that allows for a six-membered transition state.

So, the diol would have two adjacent -OH groups, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is formed on carbons separated by a certain distance, allowing cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction would open up and then form a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the product. The product is either (R) or (S) configuration. The starting materials (A and B) have either R or S configuration, which would influence the product's configuration.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material's configuration. For example, if the ketone is prochiral and we reduce it with a reagent that can induce asymmetry, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

But in this case, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which would have a certain configuration. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, and the ester becomes an alcohol as well.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which is more oxidized than an alcohol. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the reduction of the starting material forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which can then cyclize to form the pyranone.

So, the starting material is an alpha-keto ester: RCOCH2COOR'. Upon reduction with LiBH4, both the ketone and ester are reduced to alcohols: RCH2CH2-OH and R'OH.

But then, how does the ring form? Maybe the two alcohols can form a hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which can then form the pyran ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then forms the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon oxidation, forms the pyranone.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this the wrong way around. Let's try to think about the product as the result of a reduction.

The product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester that upon reduction would form a diol, which can then form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester). Upon reduction with LiBH4, the lactone would open up to form a diol, which then forms the pyranone upon dehydration or some other process.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry and how the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) affect the product's configuration.

Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Typically, BH3 is used for the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, but in the presence of other conditions, it can also reduce ketones to secondary alcohols.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple reduction but involves other steps, like cyclization. So, the starting material is an ester and a ketone, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the diol doesn't reduce the ketone but forms the ring structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon treatment with a reducing agent forms a diol, and the diol then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a gamma-keto ester. For example, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-R
|
CH2-C-O-R'
|
CH2-COOH

Wait, upon treatment with a reducing agent, the acetal would break down, and the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that would form the pyranone.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal, so the starting material must have a carbonyl group and an alcohol group in positions that allow for cyclization. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto alcohol.

So, the structure would be something like:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-COOH

But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a 3-keto alcohol, which upon reduction gives a diol, which can form the ring.

Wait, but the starting material in the options is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group and an ester.

Hmm.

Maybe I should think about the reaction using each reducing agent.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. So, the ester group (COOR') in the starting material would be reduced to a CH2OH group.

If the starting material also has a ketone group (C=O), LiBH4 would reduce that to a CH2OH as well, giving a diol.

So, the starting material (options A and B) would have both a ketone and an ester. Upon treatment with LiBH4, both would be reduced to alcohols, creating two hydroxyl groups.

Then, perhaps the diol would undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which has a ketone. So that would mean that one of the alcohol groups is oxidized back to a ketone, which doesn't make sense under reducing conditions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction opens up and reforms into the pyranone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that's more about forming enones.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone remains as a ketone. But that doesn't fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has an ethyl group at position 4, which is two carbons away from the oxygen.

So, the starting material must have the ethyl group in a position that, when reduced and cyclized, ends up at position 4.

Looking at the starting material options, they are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the ethyl is at position 3, and the ester is at position 5.

So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu

So, when treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the ester (CO-O-iBu) would be reduced to a CH2OH group. The ketone (5-oxo) would also be reduced to a CH2OH group.

Wait, but that would give a diol. Then, perhaps the diol would form a cyclic structure via intramolecular hemiacetal formation, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of the ester and ketone gives a diol, which then loses a water molecule to form the cyclic ketone. But under reducing conditions, that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the ester is not the functional group being reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl group is being reduced, and the ester remains.

Wait, but LiBH4 typically reduces esters. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a ketone and an ester, and only the ketone is reduced, leaving the ester intact. Then, the resulting diol could form the ring.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate reduction of the gamma-keto ester. LiBH4 can perform conjugate reductions, so maybe it reduces the ester in a way that forms the pyran ring.

Wait, conjugate reduction of a gamma-keto ester would add hydrogen across the conjugated double bond, but I'm not sure if that leads to ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester, and upon reduction, the ring opens and reforms.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

The product from A is (R) configuration, and from B is (S). So if the starting material A leads to R, and B leads to S, then the starting materials must have opposite configurations.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S, and option C has A as S and B as R.

So, if the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, then the correct option would have A as R and B as S, or vice versa.

But how does the configuration of the starting material influence the product's configuration?

Assuming the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with an R configuration, upon reduction, the configuration of the resulting diol would depend on the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration due to retention or inversion during the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the same configuration. For example, if the starting material is (R), upon reduction, the new chiral center forms (R) as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemical outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is retained in the product, so if A is R, the product is R, and if B is S, the product is S.

Looking back at the question, A uses LiBH4 and gives R, and B uses BH3 and gives S.

Wait, but BH3 is a different reducing agent. Wait, noâ€”BH3 is typically used in hydroboration, but in some cases, it can be used for ketone reductions, perhaps leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both used for ketone reductions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce esters, while BH3 is usually used in more specific conditions, like hydroboration.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with BH3 is not a simple reduction but a hydroboration-oxidation, but the product is a ketone. That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the product isn't from a simple reduction but a more complex reaction like an aldol addition or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of an ester to an alcohol, which then undergoes an intramolecular oxidation to form the pyranone. But that seems unlikely under reducing conditions.

I think I'm stuck on the exact reaction mechanism. Let me try to think of the possible answer based on the options and the product configurations.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S)
B) A and B are both (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

The products from A and B have (R) and (S) configurations, respectively. So the starting materials must have opposite configurations if their reactions lead to opposite product configurations.

If the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product, then the correct option would be D or C.

Assuming that the configuration is retained, then if A is R, product is R; if B is S, product is S. So the correct option would be D.

But wait, when you reduce a chiral center, does the configuration change?

In the case of reducing a ketone (which is planar) to an alcohol, the configuration of the new chiral center is determined by the reagent and the starting material's configuration. Wait, no, because the ketone isn't chiral. So, perhaps the chiral center is in the starting material, and its configuration influences the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration via retention or inversion.

Wait, perhaps when the ester is reduced, the configuration at the adjacent chiral center determines the product's configuration.

But I'm not certain. Looking back, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reducing agents are influencing the stereochemistry of the ring formation.

Wait, another thought: The starting material has a stereochemistry at the 3-ethyl group. When the ester is reduced, the configuration at that center influences the product's configuration.

If the starting material A is (R), then the product from A (with LiBH4) is (R). Similarly, starting material B is (S), product from B is (S).

So, the correct option would be D, where A is R and B is S.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) that yield the products (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one when treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom and a ketone group at position 2. The ethyl group is at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product is either (R) or (S), depending on the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols.
   - **BH3**: Typically used for hydroboration-oxidation, but in this context, it likely reduces the ester to an alcohol while influencing the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Starting Material**:
   - The starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with an ethyl group at position 3 and an ester group at position 5. The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S) influences the stereochemistry of the product.

4. **Reaction Mechanism**:
   - The ester group in the starting material is reduced to an alcohol. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the configuration of the product. If the starting material is (R), the product will also be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

5. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would result in both products being (S), which is inconsistent with the question.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). This would result in both products being (R), which is also inconsistent with the question.
   - **Option C**: A is (S) and B is (R). This would result in the product from A being (S) and the product from B being (R), which is consistent with the question.
   - **Option D**: A is (R) and B is (S). This would result in the product from A being (R) and the product from B being (S), which is also consistent with the question.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material directly dictates the stereochemistry of the product. Since the question specifies that A produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and B produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
