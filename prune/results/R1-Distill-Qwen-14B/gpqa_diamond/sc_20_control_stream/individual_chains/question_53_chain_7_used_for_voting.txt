Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given FTIR and NMR data.

Alright, let's start by looking at the FTIR data. It shows peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹, and the IR also shows O-H stretching for the ester, but wait, no, esters typically don't have O-H because they're carbonyl connected to an oxygen. Wait, no, wait. Esters have an O=C-O group, so the carbonyl peak would be there, but I'm not sure about other peaks. Maybe the ester's oxygen would show up in other regions. Maybe the C-O stretch, which is usually around 1050-1250 cm⁻¹. So the IR suggests the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

- Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Wait, but if it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But the number of signals would depend on that. For example, para substitution in benzene gives two sets of equivalent protons, so two signals. Wait, that's for para. Ortho would have maybe three signals or two, depending on symmetry. But if it's a di-substituted ring with substituents that don't have symmetry, maybe you get more signals. Hmm, but according to the NMR data, there are two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe it's para-substituted, giving two sets of equivalent protons. So that suggests the aromatic ring is para-substituted.

- Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds. Since there are two signals, perhaps there are two different types of vinyl protons. For example, in a structure like a styrene group or something similar. The doublet might be coupling with one neighboring proton, and the doublet of quartets could be coupling with two sets of protons—maybe adjacent to two different environments.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. And no signals for –CH2 groups. So the compound has two methyl groups. But how? If they are attached to the ring, perhaps as substituents, like in an ester group or something else.

Wait, but the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring. Each substituent could be a group. So perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that brings in some vinyl and methyl groups.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O. No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group with a vinyl and methyl?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that one substituent is an ester (like -OOCR) and the other substituent is something else that has vinyl protons and methyl groups.

Wait, let me think of possible structures. So if the aromatic ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Ester groups are often like -COO-. But wait, in an aromatic ester, the substituent could be something like -OOCR, where R is an alkyl group.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like a phenyl ester), and the other substituent is another group that contributes to the NMR signals.

Wait, but the NMR has two methyl groups. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group, or maybe one substituent has two methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, another thought: if the substituents are both ester groups, but that's unlikely because di-ester would probably have more oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, but that seems a bit vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methoxyl group, but that doesn't explain the vinyl protons.

Hmm. Let's think about the NMR signals again. The aromatic protons: two signals, so perhaps the substituents are in para positions, making the two equivalent sets of aromatic protons.

The vinyl protons: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests perhaps a structure where each vinyl proton is coupled to others. For example, in an allyl group, or maybe in a styryl group (like a substituted ethenyl group attached to the benzene ring).

Wait, another possibility: if one substituent is a methoxy group, but that wouldn't give vinyl protons. Hmm. Maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Or perhaps the substituents are two different groups, each contributing to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a substituent that has its own vinyl and methyl groups. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and a styryl group (like a vinyl group attached to another substituent that could have methyl groups). Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent, such as an acrylate group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with one substituent being an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3) and the other substituent being a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a group that includes a vinyl and methyl.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-R) and the other is a vinylmethyl group, such as -CH2CH2, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester (like -COO-) and the other being a vinyl group connected to a methyl (like -CH2CH2O- ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R) and another substituent is a group with a vinyl and methyl, such as a propenyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals in total. Let's break it down:

- Two aromatic protons (so maybe two sets, each integrating to 2H each? Or perhaps each integrating to 1H each?), but wait, in a benzene ring, the number of H's depends on substitution. Let's say it's para-substituted, so each set has two H's. So two signals, each integrating to 2H.

- Two vinyl protons: one is a doublet, so maybe one proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, maybe another proton. Wait, but NMR signals can represent multiple protons if they are equivalent. So perhaps the doublet is two equivalent protons (like a trans coupling), and the doublet of quartets is two protons that are coupled to two other sets. Or maybe each is a single proton. Hmm.

- Two methyl groups: perhaps each as singlets, but depending on neighboring groups. If they are attached to something that causes splitting, but in the NMR, they are two separate signals, each integrating to 3H. So maybe two different methyl groups, each with three H.

So putting this together, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. Wait, but a vinyl group would typically have two protons adjacent to it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the number of carbons in each option. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The formula of benzene is C6H6. Each substituent adds to that. Let's consider possible substituents.

If the molecule is di-substituted, then each substituent adds a certain number of carbons.

Let's think about ester groups. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So, suppose one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R'), and the other substituent is another group.

Wait, each substituent would add their own carbons. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like -O-CO-O-R, but that's not correct. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, the substituent would be O-CO-R' attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3, but that's a carbonate. Hmm, no, that's different. Let's think of a simple ester substituent, like -COO-R. So, for example, if R is CH2CH3, then the substituent is -COOCH2CH3. That substituent would add 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3 is COOCH2CH3, so 3 carbons including the benzene's carbon? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene. So the group is -O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (n-propoxy carbonyl?), which would add 3 carbons to the substituent.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like -O-CO-OCH3?), but that's more a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group like -COOCH2CH3. So, that's a substituent with 3 carbons: the COO is part of the ester, and the R group is ethyl.

But let's get back to the NMR data. The aromatic protons are two signals, so likely para substitution. The vinyl protons are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Hmm. Perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3 adjacent to the benzene? Or maybe the substituent is a propenyl group.

Wait, another possibility: One substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is an allyl group attached to a methyl. So, the substituent is -CH2CH2-O-CO-R? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a group like -CH2CH2O- (but I'm not sure that's right).

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2O-CO-R, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like -COOCH2CH3) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, such as -CH2CH2CH3. But that would be a propyl group, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That structure would have a vinyl group (double bond) with a methyl substituent. Then, the NMR would show vinyl protons. But how would that split?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2O- something, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about the vinyl protons. One is a doublet (maybe J= some Hz), and the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, in a trans configuration, each vinyl proton could be coupling with one proton on one side and another on the other. Alternatively, perhaps one is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are such that one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an allyl group. An allyl group would have protons in a certain coupling pattern. For example, an allyl group (CH2CHCH2) would have the middle CH proton as a triplet and the end CH2 protons as doublets. But in this case, we have two vinyl protons, each with specific coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like -CH2CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl group.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular formula.

The options have different H counts. The molecular formula is CxHyO2.

Since the compound is di-substituted on a benzene, the base formula is C6H5-. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons and hydrogens.

So, if one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R), and the other substituent is another group, let's count.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-R) and the other is a group with a vinyl and methyl group.

Let me try to outline the possible structure. Let's say the benzene ring has substituents at the para positions: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester), and the other substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-O-R, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl methyl group, such as -CH2CH2CH3, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the other substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. That would have a vinyl group (double bond) and a methyl group. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH2-CH3 attached via a double bond? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But I'm not sure how that would fit the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the number of hydrogens each substituent would contribute.

The benzene ring has 6 H's, but with two substituents, it's di-substituted, so the ring would have 4 H's left, but in the NMR, we have two signals for aromatic H's, which suggests that they are in two equivalent groups. So perhaps the ring has two substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent H's, each integrating for 2 H each.

The ester group would contribute some H's. If the ester is, say, ethyl, then the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is ethyl, then the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So that would add 2 carbons from the ethyl group (since the ester is O-CO-R, so R is ethyl, which is two carbons).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The substituent is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. If R is ethyl, then the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So that's two more carbons beyond the oxygen, making the substituent have 3 carbons (the oxygen is attached to the benzene, then the carbonyl, then the ethyl group). So the substituent (ester) would contribute 2 carbons (from ethyl) plus the oxygen and carbonyl.

Now, the other substituent. Let's say it's a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group, not a vinyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent could be a vinyl group, like -CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-O-R, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the other substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-O- attached to the ring, but that doesn't explain the methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond, like -CH2-CH(CH3). No, that's not a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So in that case, the substituent would have two CH2 groups, one of which is part of a double bond. But then, the NMR would show vinyl protons.

Wait, let's count the hydrogens. The substituent would have the structure -CH2-CH2-CH3 for propyl, but that's not vinyl. Or, as a propenyl group, -CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which would have a double bond. The substituent would be -CH2-CH=CH2 attached to the ring. Then, the vinyl protons would be the two protons on the double bond.

In that case, the NMR would show two vinyl protons. One proton (on CH2) would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH group), but wait, in that structure (CH2-CH=CH2), the protons on CH2 are next to the double bond, so they might be deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the other substituent is a group like -O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a group with both a vinyl and a methyl group. For example, a substituent like -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Or a substituent like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that would have a double bond and a methyl branch.

Wait, let's think about the number of H in the NMR. The aromatic Hs: 2 signals, 2 H each (so 4 H in total on the ring? No, wait, benzene has six H, but with two substituents, perhaps 4 H remain. Wait, if substituents are in para positions, each substituent takes one H each, leaving four H in two sets of two H each. So each aromatic signal integrates to 2 H.

Then, the vinyl H: two signals. Let's say each is a doublet or a doublet of quartets, each integrating to 2 H. Or perhaps each is a single H. Wait, vinyl groups typically have two H, but in certain structures, they might have more.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond and a methyl group. For example, substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, perhaps like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, that structure would have two vinyl H's (on the double bond) and a methyl group (CH3).

Let me try to sketch this out. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3), and the other is a group like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent would be a vinyl group attached to a methyl, leading to two vinyl H's and a methyl H.

Wait, but then the H's on the vinyl would be in different environments. Let's say in the substituent, the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Then, the protons on the double bond would be on either side of the double bond. The CH2 group before the double bond would have two H's, and the double bond would have two H's.

Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H's are split into different multiplets. Let me think about how that would work. The substituent's H's: the CH2 group adjacent to the ring would have H's that are perhaps split by the adjacent CH group (which is part of the double bond). So those H's (let's say they're on the CH2 next to the ring) would be a triplet or something. The double bond's H's would be split by their neighboring H's.

Wait, but according to the NMR description, the vinyl H's are two signals: one is a doublet, and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Or maybe it's a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. Then the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a para substituent. The propenyl group would have H's on the double bond (CH2=CH-CH2-). The H's on the double bond (CH2 and CH) would split each other's signals. For example, the CH2 group would be a triplet (coupled with the CH group), and the CH group would be a doublet. But wait, in the NMR data, the vinyl H's are two signals: a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl H's are each adjacent to two different sets of H's. For example, in a structure where each vinyl H is coupled with two other H's on either side.

Wait, another possibility: The substituent is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that would have ethylene groups but no vinyl H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a vinyl group. No, that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to figure out the molecular formula first. Let's see the options:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The benzene ring is C6H5, so the substituents add more carbons and hydrogens.

Assuming the substituents are two groups: one is an ester (like O-CO-R) and the other is some group with a vinyl and methyl.

Let's say one substituent is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). So that's 3 carbons (O, CO, and ethyl's 2 carbons?), so adding 2 carbons from the ethyl group.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-R, so R is the alkyl group. Let's say R is ethyl, which is two carbons. So the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So that's 2 carbons from R.

The other substituent is perhaps a group like CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a propyl group, not a vinyl). Alternatively, substituent could be a vinyl group with a methyl, like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That would add 4 carbons (CH2, C, two CH2's?), no, wait: the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the benzene. So that substituent has 4 carbons: the CH2 before the double bond, the C(CH3), and the CH2 after the double bond. No, wait, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which has three carbons: the CH2 attached to the ring, the C(CH3), and the CH2.

Wait, let me recount: The substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, that's three carbons: the CH2 (attached to the ring), the C(CH3), and the CH2 on the other side of the double bond.

So, the substituent adds three carbons.

So, the benzene ring is six carbons. The two substituents: one is O-CO-CH2CH3 (2 carbons beyond the oxygen), and the other is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 (3 carbons). So total carbons: 6 + 2 +3 = 11. But wait, the ester substituent O-CO-CH2CH3 would have 3 carbons (the O is attached to the ring, then the CO, then the CH2CH3, which is 2 carbons). So O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons (including the O). So, substituents contribute 3 (ester) +3 (vinyl methyl) =6 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total carbons would be 6+3+3=12? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the benzene is C6H5. Each substituent adds its own carbons. The ester substituent (O-CO-CH2CH3) has 3 carbons: O is attached to the benzene, then the CO, then CH2CH3 (2 carbons). So substituent has 3 carbons.

The other substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2: that's 4 carbons? Because the CH2 is attached to the ring, then the C(CH3), then CH2, making three carbons. Wait, the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is three carbons: the CH2, the C, and the CH2. Or is the substituent four carbons? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group. That's three carbons.

So, if the benzene is C6, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (3 carbons), substituent 2 is CH2-CH2-CH3 (3 carbons). So total carbons: 6 +3 +3 =12. So molecular formula would be C12HxO2.

Looking at the options, options B and C are C12H14O2 and C12H12O2.

But wait, the substituent with the vinyl group (if substituent 2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is three carbons, then the substituents would add 3 +3 =6, making 6+6=12. So, the molecular formula would be C12.

But then, what about the H's?

The benzene ring with two substituents would have 6 H's in the ring. With substituents, it's di-substituted, so the ring H's would be 4 H's, split into two signals of 2 H each.

Each substituent adds its own H's. The ester substituent, O-CO-CH2CH3, has CH2CH3, which contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H).

The other substituent, let's say it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent's structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would have the structure: CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH(CH3) connected via a double bond to a CH2. Wait, that's not possible because double bonds can't have two single bonds. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl group), which would contribute 2 H's on each CH2 group and 3 H's on the CH3. So that's 2 +2 +3 =7 H's.

Wait, but let's get back. The substituent with the vinyl group would have some H's. Let's say substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-R, but perhaps that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-. So the substituent has two H's on the double bond and two H's on the CH2 group attached to the ring.

So, substituent 2 contributes 4 H's: 2 from the CH2 next to the ring, and 2 from the double bond.

The ester substituent contributes 5 H's (from CH2CH3).

So, total H's from substituents:5 (ester) +4 (vinyl CH2 and CH2)=9 H's.

Benzene ring has 4 H's (two signals, each 2 H).

So total H's:4 +9=13.

But looking at the options, the H counts are 14, 12, etc.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.

The benzene ring: 6 carbons, with two substituents. So, 6 H's minus 2 H's (each substituent takes one H?), so 4 H's left.

Ester substituent: O-CO-CH2CH3 has CH2CH3 (5 H's).

Other substituent: Let's say it's a group like -CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl group), which has 2 H's on the first CH2, 2 H's on the second CH2, and 3 H's on the CH3. So that's 7 H's.

So substituents contribute 5 (ester) +7 (propyl) =12 H's.

Ring contributes 4 H's.

Total H's:12 +4=16. But none of the options have 16 H's. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is not a propyl group but something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent contributing the vinyl H's is a methylene group (CH2) attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that substituent would have a structure like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So, the substituent has three carbons: the CH2 attached to the ring, the central carbon with a CH3 group, and the CH2 at the end of the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That's three carbons: the CH2 attached to the ring, the C(CH3) connected via a double bond to CH2.

Wait, but that would make the substituent have a double bond between the second and third carbons. So, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Then, the substituent would have 5 H's: the CH2 has 2 H's, the C(CH3) has 1 H (since it's connected to the CH3), and the CH2 has 2 H's. Wait, but the double bond is between the C(CH3) and the CH2, so it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split.

So substituent 2 would contribute:

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3): 1 H (since it's a CH group attached to a CH3 and a double bond).

Wait, no, the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the C in the middle is connected to two CH2 groups via a double bond. Wait, no, that's not possible because a double bond can't have two single bonds to a CH2 groups on each side. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a propyl group without double bonds, which wouldn't explain the vinyl H's.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like, substituent is -CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with a double bond and a methyl group. For example, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's a single bond, so not a vinyl.

Alternatively, substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That way, the substituent has a double bond and a methyl group.

In that case, substituent 2 would contribute:

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's, and the C(CH3) has 1 H (since it's connected via a double bond to the CH2, and has a CH3 group).

Wait, no, in this structure, the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the substituent has three carbons. The CH2 group attached to the ring has 2 H's. The middle C has a CH3 and is double-bonded to CH2. So, the middle C would have no H's (it's a double bond, so sp² hybridized), but the CH2 on the end would have 2 H's.

So substituent 2's H's are 2 (from CH2) + 2 (from CH2 at end) =4 H's.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH2CH3) has 5 H's (CH2CH3).

So substituent 1:5 H's, substituent 2:4 H's.

Ring has 4 H's.

Total H's:5 +4 +4 =13. But the options don't have 13 H's.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The molecular formula options are C11H14O2, C12H14O2, etc.

The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons. Substituents add more carbons.

If the ester substituent is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (2 carbons), that adds 3 carbons (O, C from CO, and ethyl's 2 C's).

The other substituent must add the remaining carbons to reach the total in the options. Let's say the other substituent is a group with 6 carbons? No, that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent contributes a total of 6 carbons: for example, a propenyl group (3 C's) and something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group or something else, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has two methyl groups, each as a singlet or some other splitting.

In the substituent, if there are two methyl groups, each with 3 H's, that would contribute 6 H's.

Looking back, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So, two different methyl groups. For example, one methyl from the ester (like the ethyl group's CH3) and another methyl from a substituent like CH(CH3).

Wait, if the ester is O-CO-CH2CH3, that's a ethyl ester, which gives a CH3 at the end. So that's one methyl group. Then, the other substituent must have another methyl group.

Like, substituent 2 is a group that has a methyl, such as a CH(CH3) group.

So substituent 2 could be a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, such as CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In that case, substituent 2 would have a methyl group (CH3), contributing 3 H's.

So substituent 1 (ester) has a methyl group (3 H's), substituent 2 (vinyl methyl) has another methyl group (3 H's), totaling 6 H's from methyl groups.

The NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups, so perhaps each methyl is in a different environment, leading to two separate signals.

Now, the substituent 2 (vinyl methyl) would also contribute its own H's. If substituent 2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then the substituent would have:

- CH2 group: 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

Wait, but the substituent would have a double bond, so the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would split each other.

In the NMR, this would lead to two signals for the vinyl H's. One might be a doublet (coupled with one neighboring H), and the other a doublet of quartets (coupled with two neighboring H's on either side).

Putting this together, the substituent 2 would contribute:

- 2 H's from the CH2 next to the ring.

- 2 H's from the CH2 at the end of the double bond.

So 4 H's in total.

Ester substituent contributes 5 H's (from CH2CH3).

Benzene ring contributes 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 H's (ester) +3 H's (substituent 2) =6 H's.

So total H's:5 (ester) +4 (substituent 2) +4 (ring) +6 (methyl) =19. That can't be right because the options don't go that high.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. The H's from substituent 2's CH2 groups are part of the 4 H's I already counted. So I shouldn't add them again.

Wait, let me recount properly.

Ester substituent: O-CO-CH2CH3 → 2 carbons in CH2CH3, contributing 5 H's.

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 → has 2 CH2 groups, each with 2 H's → 4 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Methyl groups: CH3 from ester (3 H's) and CH3 from substituent 2 (3 H's) → 6 H's.

Total H's: 5 (ester) +4 (substituent 2) +4 (ring) +6 (methyl) → 19. That's way too high. So I must have miscounted.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the number of H's each substituent contributes, including all H's on the substituent.

Ester substituent: O-CO-CH2CH3.

- The CH2CH3 group contributes 5 H's (2 from CH2, 3 from CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

- The CH2 next to the ring contributes 2 H's.

- The C(CH3) is double-bonded to CH2, so the CH2 contributes 2 H's.

So substituent 2 contributes 4 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent 2) =6 H's.

So total H's:5 +4 +4 +6=19.

Wait, that can't be right because the options have H counts around 12-14.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is something else. Maybe it doesn't have a methyl group but contributes to the methyl signals in another way.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond, like -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group that contributes two methyl groups. But the NMR only shows two signals for methyl groups, meaning two different methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the other substituent is a group like -O-CH2-CO-O-R, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, the structure could be that each substituent contributes a methyl group. For example, one substituent is an ester with a methyl group (like O-CO-CH3), and the other substituent is another group with a methyl group.

But let me check: O-CO-CH3 is a methyl ester. So substituent 1 would be O-CO-CH3, contributing 3 H's from the CH3.

Substituent 2 would then be another group with a methyl, perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl.

Wait, substituent 2 could be -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So that would add another methyl group with 3 H's.

So substituent 1: 3 H's.

Substituent 2: 3 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3) has 3 H's from CH3.

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 → 2 H's (CH2 attached to ring) and 2 H's (CH2 at end of double bond), so 4 H's.

So substituent 2 contributes 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent 2) =6 H's.

Ester substituent's H's:3 (CH3) and the CH2 group in O-CO-CH3 is attached via O, so perhaps no additional H's beyond the CH3.

Wait, no, O-CO-CH3 is a methyl ester, so substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 → that's 3 H's.

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 → CH2 (2 H's), C has a CH3 and double bond, CH2 (2 H's). So substituent 2 contributes 4 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Total H's: 3 (ester) +4 (substituent 2) +4 (ring) +6 (methyl) =17 H's. Still too high.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent 2 doesn't have a methyl group but another group that contributes to the methyl signals. Or maybe the substituent is a group with two methyl groups, but that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent 2 is a group that has a methyl group attached to a double bond, like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 has a methyl and some vinyl H's.

But I'm getting stuck on the H count. Let me think about the options again and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The molecular formula for benzene with two substituents would be C6H5-(substituent1)(substituent2).

If substituent1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester, 3 carbons: O, C, CH3), and substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 (3 carbons: CH2, C, CH2 with a CH3 attached).

So, substituent1:3 C, substituent2:4 C (CH2, C with CH3, CH2), wait no, substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which has 3 C's: the CH2, the C(CH3), and the CH2. So substituent2 adds 3 C's.

So total C's:6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =12.

So molecular formula is C12.

Looking at the options, B and C are C12.

Now, the H count.

Benzene: 6 C, but with two substituents, so 4 H's.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): contributes 3 H's (CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2):

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 4 H's.

So total H's:4 (ring) +3 (ester) +4 (substituent2) =11.

Plus, the methyl groups: O-CO-CH3 has CH3 (3 H's), and substituent2 has CH3 (3 H's). So 6 H's from methyl groups.

Wait, but substituent2's CH3 is part of the substituent2's 3 C's. So substituent2's structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which has a CH3 group (3 H's).

So, substituent1's CH3 and substituent2's CH3 contribute 3 +3=6 H's.

So, total H's:4 (ring) +3 (ester H) +4 (substituent2 H) +6 (methyl) =17. That's not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps substituent2 doesn't contribute a methyl group, but another group that contributes to the NMR's CH3 signals.

Wait, perhaps substituent2 is a group like CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl), but that doesn't have a vinyl group. Alternatively, substituent2 is a group like CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't fit the vinyl H's.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent2 is a group like CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm assuming the substituents are both attached to the ring, but perhaps one substituent is part of a larger group that includes both the ester and the vinyl groups.

Wait, for example, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a single substituent that is a more complex group, including both the ester and the vinyl and methyl groups.

Let me think: the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (ethyl ester). Wait, no, that's just the ester group.

Alternatively, substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't explain the vinyl H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation.

The molecular formula for the options:

For option B: C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 = (26 -14)/2=6.

So 6 degrees of unsaturation: which could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus two double bonds (like an ester and a vinyl group) and a ring from the ester's carbonyl.

Wait, benzene ring is 3 DoU (3 double bonds). An ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU). A vinyl group has a double bond (1 DoU). So total DoU:3 +1 +1=5. But the option B's DoU is 6, so that leaves one more DoU, which could be a ring or another double bond.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a ring.

But perhaps this approach isn't helping.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals. Each signal represents a set of equivalent H's.

- Two aromatic signals: likely due to para substituents, making two sets of equivalent H's.

- Two vinyl signals: perhaps each is a doublet, indicating coupling with one neighboring H.

- Two CH3 signals: likely two different methyl groups, each with three H's.

Wait, the NMR data's signals:

Aromatic: 2 signals.

Vinyl: 2 signals (doublet and doublet of quartets).

CH3: 2 signals.

So total of 6 signals. That makes sense.

So, the substituents must contribute the vinyl H's and the methyl groups.

If substituent1 is an ester (like O-CO-R), and substituent2 is a group with a vinyl and a methyl.

Let me consider substituent2 as a group like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That would have a methyl group and a vinyl group.

In this case, substituent2 contributes:

- Two H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond (could split into two signals, perhaps a doublet and a doublet of quartets).

- A methyl group (CH3) with 3 H's.

So substituent2 would contribute the two vinyl H signals and one methyl signal.

Substituent1 (ester) would contribute a methyl group (from R in the ester), which would be the other methyl signal.

So, the two methyl groups are from the ester's R group and substituent2's CH3.

Now, the ester substituent is O-CO-R. Let's say R is a methyl group (O-CO-CH3), then substituent1 contributes a methyl group (CH3) with 3 H's.

Substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which contributes a methyl group (CH3, 3 H's) and two vinyl H's.

So, the NMR would show:

- Two aromatic signals.

- Two vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets).

- Two methyl signals (each 3 H's).

Which matches the data.

Now, the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + substituent1 (O-CO-CH3: 3 C) + substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2: 4 C?) Wait, substituent2's structure: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, substituent2 has three carbons: CH2, C(CH3), and CH2. So substituent2 adds 3 C's.

Total C's:6 +3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =12.

So formula is C12H?O2.

Now, let's count the H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's (two signals, each 2 H).

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): 3 H's (CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2):

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =6 H's.

So total H's:4 (ring) +3 (ester) +4 (substituent2) +6 (methyl) =17. That's way too high.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake in counting the H's. Let me try again.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): contributes 3 H's (CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2):

- The CH2 groups have 2 H's each → 2*2=4 H's.

- The methyl group (CH3) contributes 3 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 4 H's from CH2 groups and 3 H's from CH3.

Wait, but substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent includes a CH2 (2 H's), a C(CH3) (which is connected to a double bond and a CH2), and a CH2 (2 H's). So substituent2 contributes 4 H's (from the CH2 groups) and 3 H's (from the CH3).

So substituent2:4 +3=7 H's.

Ester substituent:3 H's.

Benzene ring:4 H's.

Total H's:4 +3 +7=14. Plus, the methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =6 H's. So total H's would be 4 (ring) +3 (ester) +7 (substituent2) +6 (methyl) → 20. No, that can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each part separately.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): contributes 3 H's (from CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2): contributes:

- CH2 (next to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

- CH3: 3 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 2 +2 +3 =7 H's.

Benzene ring:4 H's.

Total H's:3 (ester) +7 (substituent2) +4 (ring) =14.

But the options have H counts of 12,14, etc.

Ah! So the molecular formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

Wait, because substituent1 (ester) is O-CO-CH3, which adds 3 C's and 3 H's.

Substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which adds 3 C's and 7 H's.

Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

So:

C:6 +3 +3=12.

H:4 (ring) +3 (ester) +7 (substituent2) =14.

O:2 (from ester).

So molecular formula is C12H14O2, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound contains an ester group (indicated by the FTIR spectrum) and exhibits six signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of signals for CH₂ groups suggests that the compound does not contain any methylene groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group indicates the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) and an oxygen atom in the structure.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, leaving two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest the presence of a vinyl group with protons in different environments.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two distinct methyl groups in the structure.

3. **Structural Interpretation**:
   - The benzene ring is para-substituted, with one substituent being an ester group (e.g., -O-CO-R) and the other substituent containing a vinyl group and a methyl group.
   - The ester group contributes one methyl group (e.g., -O-CO-CH₃), and the vinyl-containing substituent contributes another methyl group (e.g., -CH₃ attached to the vinyl group).

4. **Molecular Formula**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons.
   - The ester group contributes 3 carbons (e.g., -O-CO-CH₃).
   - The vinyl-containing substituent contributes 3 carbons (e.g., -CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂).
   - Total carbons: \(6 + 3 + 3 = 12\).
   - Hydrogen count:
     - Benzene ring: 4 hydrogens (two signals, each integrating to 2H).
     - Ester group: 3 hydrogens (from -CH₃).
     - Vinyl-containing substituent: 7 hydrogens (2 from -CH₂ groups and 3 from -CH₃).
     - Total hydrogens: \(4 + 3 + 7 = 14\).
   - Oxygen count: 2 (from the ester group).

   Thus, the molecular formula is \(C_{12}H_{14}O_{2}\).

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) \(C_{11}H_{14}O_{2}\)**: Incorrect, as it has one fewer carbon.
   - **B) \(C_{12}H_{14}O_{2}\)**: Correct, matches the derived molecular formula.
   - **C) \(C_{12}H_{12}O_{2}\)**: Incorrect, as it has two fewer hydrogens.
   - **D) \(C_{11}H_{12}O_{2}\)**: Incorrect, as it has two fewer carbons and two fewer hydrogens.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is \(C_{12}H_{14}O_{2}\), corresponding to option **B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given FTIR and NMR data.

Alright, let's start by looking at the FTIR data. It shows peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹, and the IR also shows O-H stretching for the ester, but wait, no, esters typically don't have O-H because they're carbonyl connected to an oxygen. Wait, no, wait. Esters have an O=C-O group, so the carbonyl peak would be there, but I'm not sure about other peaks. Maybe the ester's oxygen would show up in other regions. Maybe the C-O stretch, which is usually around 1050-1250 cm⁻¹. So the IR suggests the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

- Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Wait, but if it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But the number of signals would depend on that. For example, para substitution in benzene gives two sets of equivalent protons, so two signals. Wait, that's for para. Ortho would have maybe three signals or two, depending on symmetry. But if it's a di-substituted ring with substituents that don't have symmetry, maybe you get more signals. Hmm, but according to the NMR data, there are two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe it's para-substituted, giving two sets of equivalent protons. So that suggests the aromatic ring is para-substituted.

- Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds. Since there are two signals, perhaps there are two different types of vinyl protons. For example, in a structure like a styrene group or something similar. The doublet might be coupling with one neighboring proton, and the doublet of quartets could be coupling with two sets of protons—maybe adjacent to two different environments.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. And no signals for –CH2 groups. So the compound has two methyl groups. But how? If they are attached to the ring, perhaps as substituents, like in an ester group or something else.

Wait, but the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring. Each substituent could be a group. So perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that brings in some vinyl and methyl groups.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O. No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group with a vinyl and methyl?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that one substituent is an ester (like -OOCR) and the other substituent is something else that has vinyl protons and methyl groups.

Wait, let me think of possible structures. So if the aromatic ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Ester groups are often like -COO-. But wait, in an aromatic ester, the substituent could be something like -OOCR, where R is an alkyl group.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like a phenyl ester), and the other substituent is another group that contributes to the NMR signals.

Wait, but the NMR has two methyl groups. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group, or maybe one substituent has two methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, another thought: if the substituents are both ester groups, but that's unlikely because di-ester would probably have more oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, but that seems a bit vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methoxyl group, but that doesn't explain the vinyl protons.

Hmm. Let's think about the NMR signals again. The aromatic protons: two signals, so perhaps the substituents are in para positions, making the two equivalent sets of aromatic protons.

The vinyl protons: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests perhaps a structure where each vinyl proton is coupled to others. For example, in an allyl group, or maybe in a styryl group (like a substituted ethenyl group attached to the benzene ring).

Wait, another possibility: if one substituent is a methoxy group, but that wouldn't give vinyl protons. Hmm. Maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Or perhaps the substituents are two different groups, each contributing to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a substituent that has its own vinyl and methyl groups. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and a styryl group (like a vinyl group attached to another substituent that could have methyl groups). Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent, such as an acrylate group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with one substituent being an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3) and the other substituent being a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a group that includes a vinyl and methyl.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-R) and the other is a vinylmethyl group, such as -CH2CH2, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester (like -COO-) and the other being a vinyl group connected to a methyl (like -CH2CH2O- ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R) and another substituent is a group with a vinyl and methyl, such as a propenyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals in total. Let's break it down:

- Two aromatic protons (so maybe two sets, each integrating to 2H each? Or perhaps each integrating to 1H each?), but wait, in a benzene ring, the number of H's depends on substitution. Let's say it's para-substituted, so each set has two H's. So two signals, each integrating to 2H.

- Two vinyl protons: one is a doublet, so maybe one proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, maybe another proton. Wait, but NMR signals can represent multiple protons if they are equivalent. So perhaps the doublet is two equivalent protons (like a trans coupling), and the doublet of quartets is two protons that are coupled to two other sets. Or maybe each is a single proton. Hmm.

- Two methyl groups: perhaps each as singlets, but depending on neighboring groups. If they are attached to something that causes splitting, but in the NMR, they are two separate signals, each integrating to 3H. So maybe two different methyl groups, each with three H.

So putting this together, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. Wait, but a vinyl group would typically have two protons adjacent to it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the number of carbons in each option. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The formula of benzene is C6H6. Each substituent adds to that. Let's consider possible substituents.

If the molecule is di-substituted, then each substituent adds a certain number of carbons.

Let's think about ester groups. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So, suppose one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R'), and the other substituent is another group.

Wait, each substituent would add their own carbons. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like -O-CO-O-R, but that's not correct. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, the substituent would be O-CO-R' attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3, but that's a carbonate. Hmm, no, that's different. Let's think of a simple ester substituent, like -COO-R. So, for example, if R is CH2CH3, then the substituent is -COOCH2CH3. That substituent would add 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3 is COOCH2CH3, so 3 carbons including the benzene's carbon? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene. So the group is -O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (n-propoxy carbonyl?), which would add 3 carbons to the substituent.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like -O-CO-OCH3?), but that's more a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group like -COOCH2CH3. So, that's a substituent with 3 carbons: the COO is part of the ester, and the R group is ethyl.

But let's get back to the NMR data. The aromatic protons are two signals, so likely para substitution. The vinyl protons are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Hmm. Perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3 adjacent to the benzene? Or maybe the substituent is a propenyl group.

Wait, another possibility: One substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is an allyl group attached to a methyl. So, the substituent is -CH2CH2-O-CO-R? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a group like -CH2CH2O- (but I'm not sure that's right).

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2O-CO-R, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like -COOCH2CH3) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, such as -CH2CH2CH3. But that would be a propyl group, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That structure would have a vinyl group (double bond) with a methyl substituent. Then, the NMR would show vinyl protons. But how would that split?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2O- something, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about the vinyl protons. One is a doublet (maybe J= some Hz), and the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, in a trans configuration, each vinyl proton could be coupling with one proton on one side and another on the other. Alternatively, perhaps one is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are such that one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an allyl group. An allyl group would have protons in a certain coupling pattern. For example, an allyl group (CH2CHCH2) would have the middle CH proton as a triplet and the end CH2 protons as doublets. But in this case, we have two vinyl protons, each with specific coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like -CH2CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl group.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular formula.

The options have different H counts. The molecular formula is CxHyO2.

Since the compound is di-substituted on a benzene, the base formula is C6H5-. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons and hydrogens.

So, if one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R), and the other substituent is another group, let's count.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-R) and the other is a group with a vinyl and methyl group.

Let me try to outline the possible structure. Let's say the benzene ring has substituents at the para positions: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester), and the other substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-O-R, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl methyl group, such as -CH2CH2CH3, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the other substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. That would have a vinyl group (double bond) and a methyl group. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH2-CH3 attached via a double bond? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But I'm not sure how that would fit the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the number of hydrogens each substituent would contribute.

The benzene ring has 6 H's, but with two substituents, it's di-substituted, so the ring would have 4 H's left, but in the NMR, we have two signals for aromatic H's, which suggests that they are in two equivalent groups. So perhaps the ring has two substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent H's, each integrating for 2 H each.

The ester group would contribute some H's. If the ester is, say, ethyl, then the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is ethyl, then the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So that would add 2 carbons from the ethyl group (since the ester is O-CO-R, so R is ethyl, which is two carbons).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The substituent is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. If R is ethyl, then the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So that's two more carbons beyond the oxygen, making the substituent have 3 carbons (the oxygen is attached to the benzene, then the carbonyl, then the ethyl group). So the substituent (ester) would contribute 2 carbons (from ethyl) plus the oxygen and carbonyl.

Now, the other substituent. Let's say it's a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group, not a vinyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent could be a vinyl group, like -CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-O-R, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the other substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-O- attached to the ring, but that doesn't explain the methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond, like -CH2-CH(CH3). No, that's not a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So in that case, the substituent would have two CH2 groups, one of which is part of a double bond. But then, the NMR would show vinyl protons.

Wait, let's count the hydrogens. The substituent would have the structure -CH2-CH2-CH3 for propyl, but that's not vinyl. Or, as a propenyl group, -CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which would have a double bond. The substituent would be -CH2-CH=CH2 attached to the ring. Then, the vinyl protons would be the two protons on the double bond.

In that case, the NMR would show two vinyl protons. One proton (on CH2) would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH group), but wait, in that structure (CH2-CH=CH2), the protons on CH2 are next to the double bond, so they might be deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the other substituent is a group like -O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a group with both a vinyl and a methyl group. For example, a substituent like -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Or a substituent like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that would have a double bond and a methyl branch.

Wait, let's think about the number of H in the NMR. The aromatic Hs: 2 signals, 2 H each (so 4 H in total on the ring? No, wait, benzene has six H, but with two substituents, perhaps 4 H remain. Wait, if substituents are in para positions, each substituent takes one H each, leaving four H in two sets of two H each. So each aromatic signal integrates to 2 H.

Then, the vinyl H: two signals. Let's say each is a doublet or a doublet of quartets, each integrating to 2 H. Or perhaps each is a single H. Wait, vinyl groups typically have two H, but in certain structures, they might have more.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond and a methyl group. For example, substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, perhaps like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, that structure would have two vinyl H's (on the double bond) and a methyl group (CH3).

Let me try to sketch this out. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3), and the other is a group like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent would be a vinyl group attached to a methyl, leading to two vinyl H's and a methyl H.

Wait, but then the H's on the vinyl would be in different environments. Let's say in the substituent, the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Then, the protons on the double bond would be on either side of the double bond. The CH2 group before the double bond would have two H's, and the double bond would have two H's.

Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H's are split into different multiplets. Let me think about how that would work. The substituent's H's: the CH2 group adjacent to the ring would have H's that are perhaps split by the adjacent CH group (which is part of the double bond). So those H's (let's say they're on the CH2 next to the ring) would be a triplet or something. The double bond's H's would be split by their neighboring H's.

Wait, but according to the NMR description, the vinyl H's are two signals: one is a doublet, and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Or maybe it's a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. Then the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a para substituent. The propenyl group would have H's on the double bond (CH2=CH-CH2-). The H's on the double bond (CH2 and CH) would split each other's signals. For example, the CH2 group would be a triplet (coupled with the CH group), and the CH group would be a doublet. But wait, in the NMR data, the vinyl H's are two signals: a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl H's are each adjacent to two different sets of H's. For example, in a structure where each vinyl H is coupled with two other H's on either side.

Wait, another possibility: The substituent is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that would have ethylene groups but no vinyl H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a vinyl group. No, that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to figure out the molecular formula first. Let's see the options:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The benzene ring is C6H5, so the substituents add more carbons and hydrogens.

Assuming the substituents are two groups: one is an ester (like O-CO-R) and the other is some group with a vinyl and methyl.

Let's say one substituent is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). So that's 3 carbons (O, CO, and ethyl's 2 carbons?), so adding 2 carbons from the ethyl group.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-R, so R is the alkyl group. Let's say R is ethyl, which is two carbons. So the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So that's 2 carbons from R.

The other substituent is perhaps a group like CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a propyl group, not a vinyl). Alternatively, substituent could be a vinyl group with a methyl, like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That would add 4 carbons (CH2, C, two CH2's?), no, wait: the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the benzene. So that substituent has 4 carbons: the CH2 before the double bond, the C(CH3), and the CH2 after the double bond. No, wait, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which has three carbons: the CH2 attached to the ring, the C(CH3), and the CH2.

Wait, let me recount: The substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, that's three carbons: the CH2 (attached to the ring), the C(CH3), and the CH2 on the other side of the double bond.

So, the substituent adds three carbons.

So, the benzene ring is six carbons. The two substituents: one is O-CO-CH2CH3 (2 carbons beyond the oxygen), and the other is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 (3 carbons). So total carbons: 6 + 2 +3 = 11. But wait, the ester substituent O-CO-CH2CH3 would have 3 carbons (the O is attached to the ring, then the CO, then the CH2CH3, which is 2 carbons). So O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons (including the O). So, substituents contribute 3 (ester) +3 (vinyl methyl) =6 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total carbons would be 6+3+3=12? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the benzene is C6H5. Each substituent adds its own carbons. The ester substituent (O-CO-CH2CH3) has 3 carbons: O is attached to the benzene, then the CO, then CH2CH3 (2 carbons). So substituent has 3 carbons.

The other substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2: that's 4 carbons? Because the CH2 is attached to the ring, then the C(CH3), then CH2, making three carbons. Wait, the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is three carbons: the CH2, the C, and the CH2. Or is the substituent four carbons? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group. That's three carbons.

So, if the benzene is C6, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (3 carbons), substituent 2 is CH2-CH2-CH3 (3 carbons). So total carbons: 6 +3 +3 =12. So molecular formula would be C12HxO2.

Looking at the options, options B and C are C12H14O2 and C12H12O2.

But wait, the substituent with the vinyl group (if substituent 2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is three carbons, then the substituents would add 3 +3 =6, making 6+6=12. So, the molecular formula would be C12.

But then, what about the H's?

The benzene ring with two substituents would have 6 H's in the ring. With substituents, it's di-substituted, so the ring H's would be 4 H's, split into two signals of 2 H each.

Each substituent adds its own H's. The ester substituent, O-CO-CH2CH3, has CH2CH3, which contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H).

The other substituent, let's say it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent's structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would have the structure: CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH(CH3) connected via a double bond to a CH2. Wait, that's not possible because double bonds can't have two single bonds. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl group), which would contribute 2 H's on each CH2 group and 3 H's on the CH3. So that's 2 +2 +3 =7 H's.

Wait, but let's get back. The substituent with the vinyl group would have some H's. Let's say substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-R, but perhaps that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-. So the substituent has two H's on the double bond and two H's on the CH2 group attached to the ring.

So, substituent 2 contributes 4 H's: 2 from the CH2 next to the ring, and 2 from the double bond.

The ester substituent contributes 5 H's (from CH2CH3).

So, total H's from substituents:5 (ester) +4 (vinyl CH2 and CH2)=9 H's.

Benzene ring has 4 H's (two signals, each 2 H).

So total H's:4 +9=13.

But looking at the options, the H counts are 14, 12, etc.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.

The benzene ring: 6 carbons, with two substituents. So, 6 H's minus 2 H's (each substituent takes one H?), so 4 H's left.

Ester substituent: O-CO-CH2CH3 has CH2CH3 (5 H's).

Other substituent: Let's say it's a group like -CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl group), which has 2 H's on the first CH2, 2 H's on the second CH2, and 3 H's on the CH3. So that's 7 H's.

So substituents contribute 5 (ester) +7 (propyl) =12 H's.

Ring contributes 4 H's.

Total H's:12 +4=16. But none of the options have 16 H's. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is not a propyl group but something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent contributing the vinyl H's is a methylene group (CH2) attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that substituent would have a structure like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So, the substituent has three carbons: the CH2 attached to the ring, the central carbon with a CH3 group, and the CH2 at the end of the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That's three carbons: the CH2 attached to the ring, the C(CH3) connected via a double bond to CH2.

Wait, but that would make the substituent have a double bond between the second and third carbons. So, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Then, the substituent would have 5 H's: the CH2 has 2 H's, the C(CH3) has 1 H (since it's connected to the CH3), and the CH2 has 2 H's. Wait, but the double bond is between the C(CH3) and the CH2, so it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split.

So substituent 2 would contribute:

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3): 1 H (since it's a CH group attached to a CH3 and a double bond).

Wait, no, the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the C in the middle is connected to two CH2 groups via a double bond. Wait, no, that's not possible because a double bond can't have two single bonds to a CH2 groups on each side. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a propyl group without double bonds, which wouldn't explain the vinyl H's.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like, substituent is -CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with a double bond and a methyl group. For example, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's a single bond, so not a vinyl.

Alternatively, substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That way, the substituent has a double bond and a methyl group.

In that case, substituent 2 would contribute:

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's, and the C(CH3) has 1 H (since it's connected via a double bond to the CH2, and has a CH3 group).

Wait, no, in this structure, the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the substituent has three carbons. The CH2 group attached to the ring has 2 H's. The middle C has a CH3 and is double-bonded to CH2. So, the middle C would have no H's (it's a double bond, so sp² hybridized), but the CH2 on the end would have 2 H's.

So substituent 2's H's are 2 (from CH2) + 2 (from CH2 at end) =4 H's.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH2CH3) has 5 H's (CH2CH3).

So substituent 1:5 H's, substituent 2:4 H's.

Ring has 4 H's.

Total H's:5 +4 +4 =13. But the options don't have 13 H's.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The molecular formula options are C11H14O2, C12H14O2, etc.

The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons. Substituents add more carbons.

If the ester substituent is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (2 carbons), that adds 3 carbons (O, C from CO, and ethyl's 2 C's).

The other substituent must add the remaining carbons to reach the total in the options. Let's say the other substituent is a group with 6 carbons? No, that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent contributes a total of 6 carbons: for example, a propenyl group (3 C's) and something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group or something else, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has two methyl groups, each as a singlet or some other splitting.

In the substituent, if there are two methyl groups, each with 3 H's, that would contribute 6 H's.

Looking back, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So, two different methyl groups. For example, one methyl from the ester (like the ethyl group's CH3) and another methyl from a substituent like CH(CH3).

Wait, if the ester is O-CO-CH2CH3, that's a ethyl ester, which gives a CH3 at the end. So that's one methyl group. Then, the other substituent must have another methyl group.

Like, substituent 2 is a group that has a methyl, such as a CH(CH3) group.

So substituent 2 could be a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, such as CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In that case, substituent 2 would have a methyl group (CH3), contributing 3 H's.

So substituent 1 (ester) has a methyl group (3 H's), substituent 2 (vinyl methyl) has another methyl group (3 H's), totaling 6 H's from methyl groups.

The NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups, so perhaps each methyl is in a different environment, leading to two separate signals.

Now, the substituent 2 (vinyl methyl) would also contribute its own H's. If substituent 2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then the substituent would have:

- CH2 group: 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

Wait, but the substituent would have a double bond, so the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would split each other.

In the NMR, this would lead to two signals for the vinyl H's. One might be a doublet (coupled with one neighboring H), and the other a doublet of quartets (coupled with two neighboring H's on either side).

Putting this together, the substituent 2 would contribute:

- 2 H's from the CH2 next to the ring.

- 2 H's from the CH2 at the end of the double bond.

So 4 H's in total.

Ester substituent contributes 5 H's (from CH2CH3).

Benzene ring contributes 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 H's (ester) +3 H's (substituent 2) =6 H's.

So total H's:5 (ester) +4 (substituent 2) +4 (ring) +6 (methyl) =19. That can't be right because the options don't go that high.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. The H's from substituent 2's CH2 groups are part of the 4 H's I already counted. So I shouldn't add them again.

Wait, let me recount properly.

Ester substituent: O-CO-CH2CH3 → 2 carbons in CH2CH3, contributing 5 H's.

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 → has 2 CH2 groups, each with 2 H's → 4 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Methyl groups: CH3 from ester (3 H's) and CH3 from substituent 2 (3 H's) → 6 H's.

Total H's: 5 (ester) +4 (substituent 2) +4 (ring) +6 (methyl) → 19. That's way too high. So I must have miscounted.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the number of H's each substituent contributes, including all H's on the substituent.

Ester substituent: O-CO-CH2CH3.

- The CH2CH3 group contributes 5 H's (2 from CH2, 3 from CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

- The CH2 next to the ring contributes 2 H's.

- The C(CH3) is double-bonded to CH2, so the CH2 contributes 2 H's.

So substituent 2 contributes 4 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent 2) =6 H's.

So total H's:5 +4 +4 +6=19.

Wait, that can't be right because the options have H counts around 12-14.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is something else. Maybe it doesn't have a methyl group but contributes to the methyl signals in another way.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond, like -CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group that contributes two methyl groups. But the NMR only shows two signals for methyl groups, meaning two different methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the other substituent is a group like -O-CH2-CO-O-R, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, the structure could be that each substituent contributes a methyl group. For example, one substituent is an ester with a methyl group (like O-CO-CH3), and the other substituent is another group with a methyl group.

But let me check: O-CO-CH3 is a methyl ester. So substituent 1 would be O-CO-CH3, contributing 3 H's from the CH3.

Substituent 2 would then be another group with a methyl, perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl.

Wait, substituent 2 could be -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So that would add another methyl group with 3 H's.

So substituent 1: 3 H's.

Substituent 2: 3 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3) has 3 H's from CH3.

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 → 2 H's (CH2 attached to ring) and 2 H's (CH2 at end of double bond), so 4 H's.

So substituent 2 contributes 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent 2) =6 H's.

Ester substituent's H's:3 (CH3) and the CH2 group in O-CO-CH3 is attached via O, so perhaps no additional H's beyond the CH3.

Wait, no, O-CO-CH3 is a methyl ester, so substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 → that's 3 H's.

Substituent 2: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 → CH2 (2 H's), C has a CH3 and double bond, CH2 (2 H's). So substituent 2 contributes 4 H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's.

Total H's: 3 (ester) +4 (substituent 2) +4 (ring) +6 (methyl) =17 H's. Still too high.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent 2 doesn't have a methyl group but another group that contributes to the methyl signals. Or maybe the substituent is a group with two methyl groups, but that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent 2 is a group that has a methyl group attached to a double bond, like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 has a methyl and some vinyl H's.

But I'm getting stuck on the H count. Let me think about the options again and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The molecular formula for benzene with two substituents would be C6H5-(substituent1)(substituent2).

If substituent1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester, 3 carbons: O, C, CH3), and substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 (3 carbons: CH2, C, CH2 with a CH3 attached).

So, substituent1:3 C, substituent2:4 C (CH2, C with CH3, CH2), wait no, substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which has 3 C's: the CH2, the C(CH3), and the CH2. So substituent2 adds 3 C's.

So total C's:6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =12.

So molecular formula is C12.

Looking at the options, B and C are C12.

Now, the H count.

Benzene: 6 C, but with two substituents, so 4 H's.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): contributes 3 H's (CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2):

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 4 H's.

So total H's:4 (ring) +3 (ester) +4 (substituent2) =11.

Plus, the methyl groups: O-CO-CH3 has CH3 (3 H's), and substituent2 has CH3 (3 H's). So 6 H's from methyl groups.

Wait, but substituent2's CH3 is part of the substituent2's 3 C's. So substituent2's structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which has a CH3 group (3 H's).

So, substituent1's CH3 and substituent2's CH3 contribute 3 +3=6 H's.

So, total H's:4 (ring) +3 (ester H) +4 (substituent2 H) +6 (methyl) =17. That's not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps substituent2 doesn't contribute a methyl group, but another group that contributes to the NMR's CH3 signals.

Wait, perhaps substituent2 is a group like CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl), but that doesn't have a vinyl group. Alternatively, substituent2 is a group like CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't fit the vinyl H's.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent2 is a group like CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm assuming the substituents are both attached to the ring, but perhaps one substituent is part of a larger group that includes both the ester and the vinyl groups.

Wait, for example, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a single substituent that is a more complex group, including both the ester and the vinyl and methyl groups.

Let me think: the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (ethyl ester). Wait, no, that's just the ester group.

Alternatively, substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't explain the vinyl H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation.

The molecular formula for the options:

For option B: C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 = (26 -14)/2=6.

So 6 degrees of unsaturation: which could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus two double bonds (like an ester and a vinyl group) and a ring from the ester's carbonyl.

Wait, benzene ring is 3 DoU (3 double bonds). An ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU). A vinyl group has a double bond (1 DoU). So total DoU:3 +1 +1=5. But the option B's DoU is 6, so that leaves one more DoU, which could be a ring or another double bond.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a ring.

But perhaps this approach isn't helping.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals. Each signal represents a set of equivalent H's.

- Two aromatic signals: likely due to para substituents, making two sets of equivalent H's.

- Two vinyl signals: perhaps each is a doublet, indicating coupling with one neighboring H.

- Two CH3 signals: likely two different methyl groups, each with three H's.

Wait, the NMR data's signals:

Aromatic: 2 signals.

Vinyl: 2 signals (doublet and doublet of quartets).

CH3: 2 signals.

So total of 6 signals. That makes sense.

So, the substituents must contribute the vinyl H's and the methyl groups.

If substituent1 is an ester (like O-CO-R), and substituent2 is a group with a vinyl and a methyl.

Let me consider substituent2 as a group like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That would have a methyl group and a vinyl group.

In this case, substituent2 contributes:

- Two H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond (could split into two signals, perhaps a doublet and a doublet of quartets).

- A methyl group (CH3) with 3 H's.

So substituent2 would contribute the two vinyl H signals and one methyl signal.

Substituent1 (ester) would contribute a methyl group (from R in the ester), which would be the other methyl signal.

So, the two methyl groups are from the ester's R group and substituent2's CH3.

Now, the ester substituent is O-CO-R. Let's say R is a methyl group (O-CO-CH3), then substituent1 contributes a methyl group (CH3) with 3 H's.

Substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which contributes a methyl group (CH3, 3 H's) and two vinyl H's.

So, the NMR would show:

- Two aromatic signals.

- Two vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets).

- Two methyl signals (each 3 H's).

Which matches the data.

Now, the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + substituent1 (O-CO-CH3: 3 C) + substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2: 4 C?) Wait, substituent2's structure: CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, substituent2 has three carbons: CH2, C(CH3), and CH2. So substituent2 adds 3 C's.

Total C's:6 +3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =12.

So formula is C12H?O2.

Now, let's count the H's.

Benzene ring: 4 H's (two signals, each 2 H).

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): 3 H's (CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2):

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 4 H's.

Methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =6 H's.

So total H's:4 (ring) +3 (ester) +4 (substituent2) +6 (methyl) =17. That's way too high.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake in counting the H's. Let me try again.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): contributes 3 H's (CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2):

- The CH2 groups have 2 H's each → 2*2=4 H's.

- The methyl group (CH3) contributes 3 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 4 H's from CH2 groups and 3 H's from CH3.

Wait, but substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent includes a CH2 (2 H's), a C(CH3) (which is connected to a double bond and a CH2), and a CH2 (2 H's). So substituent2 contributes 4 H's (from the CH2 groups) and 3 H's (from the CH3).

So substituent2:4 +3=7 H's.

Ester substituent:3 H's.

Benzene ring:4 H's.

Total H's:4 +3 +7=14. Plus, the methyl groups: 3 (ester) +3 (substituent2) =6 H's. So total H's would be 4 (ring) +3 (ester) +7 (substituent2) +6 (methyl) → 20. No, that can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each part separately.

Ester substituent (O-CO-CH3): contributes 3 H's (from CH3).

Substituent2 (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2): contributes:

- CH2 (next to ring): 2 H's.

- C(CH3)=CH2: the CH2 has 2 H's.

- CH3: 3 H's.

So substituent2 contributes 2 +2 +3 =7 H's.

Benzene ring:4 H's.

Total H's:3 (ester) +7 (substituent2) +4 (ring) =14.

But the options have H counts of 12,14, etc.

Ah! So the molecular formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

Wait, because substituent1 (ester) is O-CO-CH3, which adds 3 C's and 3 H's.

Substituent2 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which adds 3 C's and 7 H's.

Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

So:

C:6 +3 +3=12.

H:4 (ring) +3 (ester) +7 (substituent2) =14.

O:2 (from ester).

So molecular formula is C12H14O2, which is option B.


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound contains an ester group (indicated by the FTIR spectrum) and exhibits six signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of signals for CH₂ groups suggests that the compound does not contain any methylene groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group indicates the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) and an oxygen atom in the structure.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, leaving two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest the presence of a vinyl group with protons in different environments.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two distinct methyl groups in the structure.

3. **Structural Interpretation**:
   - The benzene ring is para-substituted, with one substituent being an ester group (e.g., -O-CO-R) and the other substituent containing a vinyl group and a methyl group.
   - The ester group contributes one methyl group (e.g., -O-CO-CH₃), and the vinyl-containing substituent contributes another methyl group (e.g., -CH₃ attached to the vinyl group).

4. **Molecular Formula**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons.
   - The ester group contributes 3 carbons (e.g., -O-CO-CH₃).
   - The vinyl-containing substituent contributes 3 carbons (e.g., -CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂).
   - Total carbons: \(6 + 3 + 3 = 12\).
   - Hydrogen count:
     - Benzene ring: 4 hydrogens (two signals, each integrating to 2H).
     - Ester group: 3 hydrogens (from -CH₃).
     - Vinyl-containing substituent: 7 hydrogens (2 from -CH₂ groups and 3 from -CH₃).
     - Total hydrogens: \(4 + 3 + 7 = 14\).
   - Oxygen count: 2 (from the ester group).

   Thus, the molecular formula is \(C_{12}H_{14}O_{2}\).

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) \(C_{11}H_{14}O_{2}\)**: Incorrect, as it has one fewer carbon.
   - **B) \(C_{12}H_{14}O_{2}\)**: Correct, matches the derived molecular formula.
   - **C) \(C_{12}H_{12}O_{2}\)**: Incorrect, as it has two fewer hydrogens.
   - **D) \(C_{11}H_{12}O_{2}\)**: Incorrect, as it has two fewer carbons and two fewer hydrogens.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is \(C_{12}H_{14}O_{2}\), corresponding to option **B**.
