Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it out.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, sort of a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions of this structure. Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1.

Hmm, KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions (like E2) or maybe some substitution. But since it's a dibromide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two molecules of HBr. Wait, but I think when two adjacent or vicinal bromines are present, heating with a base can lead to elimination forming an alkene. But wait, in adamantane, the structure might be such that elimination isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, if you eliminate two HBr, you might form a double bond. But in the structure, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons? Or are they on opposite ends? Because adamantane has a diamond-like structure, so the 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent carbons, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination forms an alkene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). Oh wait, 1720 is in the range of a carbonyl, but maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait, but considering the reaction. Heating with KOH, which is a base. If it's a dehydrohalogenation, we might form an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide? No, an epoxide would have different NMR signals. Alternatively, the product could be an alkyne, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dibromide undergoes a substitution reaction. If it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps it undergoes an elimination to form a double bond. But the IR peak doesn't fit a double bond. Wait, but wait, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is about where you see OCH2 groups, like in ethers or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide (but epoxides usually have two protons as a singlet or multiplet, but 4.79 ppm is about right for epoxide protons). But wait, the IR at 1720 doesn't match an epoxide. Epoxides don't have carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. If the structure allows for that, maybe.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. Product 1 has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). What could that be? Maybe it's a CH2 group connected to an electronegative atom. For example, OCH2 or something else. Alternatively, it could be an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Also, the 2.41-2.23 ppm region (10H) suggests some CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps part of a cage structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another set of CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with KOH, especially in a strong base, elimination occurs to form alkenes. But that would produce an alkene, which would show a peak in the IR around 1650 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an alkene. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group, but in a dibromide, both would leave. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but without a good nucleophile, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of adamantane. But I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. That's probably a ketone, maybe. So perhaps the product is an ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement, but I'm not quite getting it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Benzil-type reaction, but no, that's for aryl halides.

Wait, maybe it's a decarboxylation? No, I don't see any carboxylic acid groups here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Because when vicinal dihalides react with a base, sometimes they form epoxides via an elimination mechanism. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a diepoxide, but then the NMR would show more than two protons, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a geminal diol, but that would be substitution and I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester or a ketone, which would explain the IR. Let me think about the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via elimination, and forms a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where both bromines are replaced by hydroxide, leading to a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the IR and NMR again. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong, probably C=O stretch. So the product likely has a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 group. Because in many ethers or esters, the OCH2 groups resonate around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So maybe it's an ether or a ketone.

Wait, but if it's a ketone, where are the carbonyl protons? Oh wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is R2C=O, so there are no protons attached. So if the product is a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't have a peak for the carbonyl protons.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be something like an epoxide. But in an epoxide, the protons are typically around 3.5–4.5 ppm and are split into a triplet or something. But the coupling would be with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait a minute. Another possibility is that the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-R, but that might not fit here either.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, which matches. But how would an ester form from a dibromide?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution with the hydroxide. But in that case, both bromines would be substituted, giving a diol. But that wouldn't form an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution followed by an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some elimination and oxidation, but I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 could be an ester or maybe an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 1720 cm-1 as well. But an aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm in the NMR for the aldehyde proton. Looking at the given NMR, the highest shift is 4.79, so no aldehyde proton. Therefore, more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But then, how would that form from a dibromide? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group formed through elimination, but I'm not quite seeing the mechanism.

Wait, maybe I should look at the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. I think aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst. So perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but that usually requires an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation.

Wait, but product 1 is the initial product. If product 1 is a ketone or ester, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of condensation.

Wait, another thought: product 1 could be a diol or an epoxide. Then heating with Al isopropoxide might induce some ring-opening or cyclization. Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination.

But perhaps I should get back to figuring out what product 1 is. Let's think about possible reactions of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, with each bridgehead carbon having three CH2 groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on two bridgehead carbons.

When reacted with KOH, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction. Let me imagine each Br is on a bridgehead. If each bridgehead has a Br, then elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads. But in adamantane, the bridgeheads are connected via two CH2 groups. So if two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads (like 1 and 3?), then elimination would form a double bond, releasing two HBr molecules.

Wait, but then the product would be an adamantane with a double bond. That's called dehydroadamantane. But does that produce a carbonyl group? No, elimination would form an alkene. So the IR should show a peak around 1650 cm-1. But the IR here is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So this can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that would require a better leaving group. Wait, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. Oh, but there's no carboxylic acid group here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure why the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone formed via some kind of pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol and then elimination to form a carbonyl. But in the starting material, we have 1,3-dibromide, which on elimination would form a diene, perhaps. Not directly a diol.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination, but here we have KOH, which is a base.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 group, as I thought before. So maybe product 1 is a diol. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is an ester. But how would an ester form from a dibromide? That doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a coupling. For example, a nucleophilic substitution where the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double elimination and forming a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure of the mechanism here.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about possible structures. If product 1 has a carbonyl, maybe it's a diketone. So 1,3-diketone adamantane. The NMR would show the carbonyl as a peak at around 210 ppm, but that's not mentioned here. The given NMR doesn't show a peak that high. So perhaps it's not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to some kind of hemiacetal or acetal group, but that's usually lower ppm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester, but I don't see how that would form from a dibromide. Maybe via substitution, but with what? Without an acid component, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a gem-diol, which then undergoes oxidation. But without an oxidizing agent, I don't see that happening.

Another thought: perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a conjugated diene, and then some other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some kind of elimination with two HBr molecules, but how? That would require a loss of HBr from each Br to form a double bond, but that gives an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each bromide to lose a proton and form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the Hofmann elimination. Hofmann elimination involves quaternary ammonium salts, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a rearrangement, like the Cope elimination, but that usually requires specific structures, such as 1,5-dienes.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the product is an epoxide, despite the IR not matching. Let's say product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it induces some ring-opening or further reaction.

Wait, but then what happens when an epoxide is treated with a Lewis acid? It could catalyze ring-opening, perhaps with a nucleophile. But in this case, product 2 is formed, and then product 3 is formed via ozonolysis.

But let me think further. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, so product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl-containing compounds.

But let's tie this back. If product 1 is an epoxide (but we have IR at 1720, so maybe an ester?), perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to make a table of the reaction steps.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
Step 2: product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2
Step 3: product 2 + ozone → product 3 (after workup with DMS)

The question is about the NMR of product 3, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps it would help to figure out each product step by step.

Let me start with product 1. The IR indicates a carbonyl. So possibly, product 1 is a ketone or ester.

But how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe via elimination of HBr and subsequent oxidation. But without an oxidizing agent, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via some mechanism I'm not familiar with.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzil-like structure, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol, which then tautomerizes or undergoes some rearrangement to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a cyclic ketone via some kind of elimination, but I can't visualize it.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone formed by the elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me imagine that: each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and upon elimination, each loss of HBr forms a double bond. Wait, but that would form a diene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group via a [2,3]-sigmatropic shift or some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but without an acid, how would that form? Unless the reaction is some kind of intramolecular reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Okay, perhaps I should move on to the next step, assuming product 1 is a ketone. Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, what could happen? Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but without an aromatic ring, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's used to catalyze an aldol condensation. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes aldol condensation, forming a larger ketone with a conjugated double bond. So product 2 would have a conjugated enone system.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone, which would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis of a conjugated enone would typically form two carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an enone, say, cyclohexenone or something similar, ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones or a ketone and an aldehyde, depending on the substitution.

But let's think about the structure. Since the starting material is adamantane, which is a cage structure, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Wait, but let's try to imagine product 3. After ozonolysis, the double bond would be cleaved. Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic ketone with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogens would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups. For example, the alpha protons. The coupling pattern would depend on their neighboring protons.

Wait, but the question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with D2O). So, perhaps it's a proton that's next to a carbonyl group, possibly in a conjugated system.

In ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond gives carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 had a double bond, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 was a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond between two carbons, ozonolysis would split it into two ketones.

But the exact structure is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more complex structure, such as a bicyclic diene, which upon ozonolysis gives a diketone.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible NMR of product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring protons.

In a typical case, a proton adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a ketone) would have coupling with adjacent protons. For example, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each proton would couple with the two adjacent in the same group and perhaps with others.

Wait, another scenario: if the structure after ozonolysis has a conjugated diene system, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a terminal aldehyde or ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone. The most deshielded proton would be the one adjacent to two carbonyl groups, maybe in a bridge structure.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis step, the workup is done with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is a mild reductant. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have two carbonyls.

Assuming product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene, product 3 would be a bridged bicyclic diketone.

So, the structure after ozonolysis would have two ketone groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one adjacent to both ketones, perhaps in a bridge position.

In that case, the proton would have coupling with two different sets of protons. Let's say it's a CH2 group between two ketones. Each proton on CH2 would couple with the other, giving a triplet (if two neighboring H's). But wait, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would couple with two equivalent H's on the same CH2 and maybe with H's from adjacent groups.

Wait, for example, if there's a structure like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R'-C=O

But that's a bit simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: if the proton is part of a CH2 group between two carbonyls, it would have neighboring H's on the same CH2 and perhaps others. So each H would have two neighboring H's on the same group, leading to a triplet. But if there are additional couplings, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, suppose the proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, it would couple with two H's from the CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not quite getting the exact structure. Let me think about the possible options for the coupling pattern.

The options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

For a proton that's coupled to two sets of non-equivalent protons, you could get a triplet of triplets (if each coupling is with two different protons, each with J1 and J2). Or, if it's coupled with two protons with the same J, it would be a triplet.

Wait, but in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each proton would couple with the two H's on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and perhaps with the adjacent CH2's H's, which could add more splitting.

But in such a case, each H would see two H's from the same group and two from the neighboring group. So each H would split into a doublet of doublets, perhaps.

But the options don't include doublet of doublets. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Wait, perhaps the proton is coupled with two different sets of two protons each, leading to a triplet of triplets. That would happen if each proton is coupled with two different groups, each with two H's.

Alternatively, if the proton is coupled with three different protons, each with different J values, it could lead to more complex splitting. But that's less likely here.

Wait, another possibility is that the proton is part of a CH2 group next to another CH2 group that's part of a larger structure. So each H would couple with two H's on its own CH2 and two H's on the adjacent CH2. If the coupling constants are all similar, this could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are different, it would be a doublet of triplets, but that's less likely.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. The most deshielded H is likely to be in a position where it's coupled to two different sets of two H's each. Let's say it's a CH2 group adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Each H would couple with two H's from each adjacent group. So for each adjacent group, two couplings, leading to triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridgehead H, which is coupled with two different H's on either side. But in adamantane derivatives, bridgehead H's are typically not present due to Bredt's rule, which disallows double bonds at bridgeheads. But in this case, it's after ozonolysis, which may form carbonyls.

Wait, in product 3, the structure might have a bridge with two carbonyl groups on either side, and the bridge H's would be the most deshielded.

So, the bridge H's would be adjacent to carbonyl groups on both sides. Each bridge H would have coupling with H's on the same bridge and maybe with H's on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group where each H is coupled with two H's from adjacent groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard. However, considering the options, a triplet of triplets would imply coupling with two different sets of two protons each, each with the same J value. Alternatively, a doublet of triplets implies coupling with two protons (giving a triplet) and another set (giving a doublet), which is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group which is itself adjacent to a carbonyl. So each H would couple with two H's on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and two H's on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). But this would give a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, considering the options, the coupling might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but another angle: the most deshielded H is part of a geminal diol, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton adjacent to two different double bonds, but that's less likely after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Wait, another thought: during ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the resulting carbonyl groups are formed. So any H's adjacent to the cleavage site would be next to carbonyl groups.

Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by a bridge. The bridge H's would be adjacent to carbonyls on both sides.

Each bridge H would be adjacent to two carbonyls, and perhaps each would have coupling with two H's on the bridge. For example, if the bridge is a CH2 group, each H would couple with the other H on the same CH2 (giving a triplet), and possibly with H's on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if the bridge is a CH2 group between two carbonyls, each H on CH2 would have coupling with the other H on the same CH2 (so triplet) and perhaps with H's on adjacent carbons. But if those adjacent H's are equivalent, it might not split further.

Alternatively, maybe the bridge is a CH group, but that's less likely. So, if it's a CH2 bridge between two carbonyls, each H on CH2 would couple with the other H, giving a triplet. But in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But the options include triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), etc.

Wait, perhaps the bridge H's are each coupled with two H's from adjacent groups. For example, each H on the bridge is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two H's. So each H would couple with two H's (giving a triplet) and another two H's (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's coupled with three different H's, leading to more splits, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded H in product 3 would be the one most downfield, which is likely to be near a carbonyl group. Suppose it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H would couple with the two H's on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So, each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with three different sets of protons, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would arise if each H is coupled with two sets of two H's each, each with the same J.

Alternatively, option C is doublet of triplets, which would happen if a H is coupled with two H's (giving a triplet) and another single H (giving a doublet). But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, if a H is coupled with two H's on one side (triplet) and another two H's on another side (another triplet), the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, considering all this, I'm leaning towards option B) triplet of triplets.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would see two H's on the same group (triplet) and two H's on the adjacent group (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Yes, that makes sense. So the coupling would be a triplet of triplets.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
- **Starting Material**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure with bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.
- **Reaction Conditions**: Heating with KOH at 240°C suggests a base-catalyzed reaction. Vicinal dihalides typically undergo elimination (E2) to form alkenes, but the IR spectrum of the product shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This indicates that the product is likely a ketone or ester.
- **NMR Analysis**: The product has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak suggests an OCH₂ group, and the IR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group. Thus, **product 1 is likely a ketone** derived from the elimination of two HBr molecules.

---

### Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with Aluminum Isopropoxide
- **Reagent**: Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃) is a Lewis acid, commonly used to catalyze reactions like aldol condensations or Friedel-Crafts alkylation/acylation.
- **Outcome**: Heating product 1 (a ketone) with Al(OiPr)₃ likely induces an aldol condensation, forming a conjugated enone (product 2). This enone contains a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2
- **Reagent**: Ozone (O₃) is used to cleave double bonds. When ozonolysis is performed at -78°C followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the double bond in product 2 is cleaved, forming two carbonyl groups in product 3.
- **Structure of Product 3**: Product 3 is a diketone, where the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to one or two carbonyl groups.

---

### Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen in Product 3
- The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to carbonyl groups. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group bridging two carbonyls. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with:
  1. The other hydrogen in the same CH₂ group (giving a triplet due to two equivalent couplings).
  2. Two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (giving another triplet).
- The combined coupling results in a **triplet of triplets** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

---

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it out.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, sort of a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions of this structure. Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1.

Hmm, KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions (like E2) or maybe some substitution. But since it's a dibromide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two molecules of HBr. Wait, but I think when two adjacent or vicinal bromines are present, heating with a base can lead to elimination forming an alkene. But wait, in adamantane, the structure might be such that elimination isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, if you eliminate two HBr, you might form a double bond. But in the structure, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons? Or are they on opposite ends? Because adamantane has a diamond-like structure, so the 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent carbons, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination forms an alkene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). Oh wait, 1720 is in the range of a carbonyl, but maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait, but considering the reaction. Heating with KOH, which is a base. If it's a dehydrohalogenation, we might form an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide? No, an epoxide would have different NMR signals. Alternatively, the product could be an alkyne, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dibromide undergoes a substitution reaction. If it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps it undergoes an elimination to form a double bond. But the IR peak doesn't fit a double bond. Wait, but wait, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is about where you see OCH2 groups, like in ethers or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide (but epoxides usually have two protons as a singlet or multiplet, but 4.79 ppm is about right for epoxide protons). But wait, the IR at 1720 doesn't match an epoxide. Epoxides don't have carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. If the structure allows for that, maybe.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. Product 1 has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). What could that be? Maybe it's a CH2 group connected to an electronegative atom. For example, OCH2 or something else. Alternatively, it could be an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Also, the 2.41-2.23 ppm region (10H) suggests some CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps part of a cage structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another set of CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with KOH, especially in a strong base, elimination occurs to form alkenes. But that would produce an alkene, which would show a peak in the IR around 1650 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an alkene. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group, but in a dibromide, both would leave. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but without a good nucleophile, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of adamantane. But I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. That's probably a ketone, maybe. So perhaps the product is an ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement, but I'm not quite getting it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Benzil-type reaction, but no, that's for aryl halides.

Wait, maybe it's a decarboxylation? No, I don't see any carboxylic acid groups here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Because when vicinal dihalides react with a base, sometimes they form epoxides via an elimination mechanism. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a diepoxide, but then the NMR would show more than two protons, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a geminal diol, but that would be substitution and I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester or a ketone, which would explain the IR. Let me think about the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via elimination, and forms a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where both bromines are replaced by hydroxide, leading to a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the IR and NMR again. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong, probably C=O stretch. So the product likely has a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 group. Because in many ethers or esters, the OCH2 groups resonate around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So maybe it's an ether or a ketone.

Wait, but if it's a ketone, where are the carbonyl protons? Oh wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is R2C=O, so there are no protons attached. So if the product is a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't have a peak for the carbonyl protons.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be something like an epoxide. But in an epoxide, the protons are typically around 3.5–4.5 ppm and are split into a triplet or something. But the coupling would be with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait a minute. Another possibility is that the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-R, but that might not fit here either.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, which matches. But how would an ester form from a dibromide?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution with the hydroxide. But in that case, both bromines would be substituted, giving a diol. But that wouldn't form an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution followed by an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some elimination and oxidation, but I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 could be an ester or maybe an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 1720 cm-1 as well. But an aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm in the NMR for the aldehyde proton. Looking at the given NMR, the highest shift is 4.79, so no aldehyde proton. Therefore, more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But then, how would that form from a dibromide? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group formed through elimination, but I'm not quite seeing the mechanism.

Wait, maybe I should look at the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. I think aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst. So perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but that usually requires an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation.

Wait, but product 1 is the initial product. If product 1 is a ketone or ester, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of condensation.

Wait, another thought: product 1 could be a diol or an epoxide. Then heating with Al isopropoxide might induce some ring-opening or cyclization. Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination.

But perhaps I should get back to figuring out what product 1 is. Let's think about possible reactions of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, with each bridgehead carbon having three CH2 groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on two bridgehead carbons.

When reacted with KOH, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction. Let me imagine each Br is on a bridgehead. If each bridgehead has a Br, then elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads. But in adamantane, the bridgeheads are connected via two CH2 groups. So if two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads (like 1 and 3?), then elimination would form a double bond, releasing two HBr molecules.

Wait, but then the product would be an adamantane with a double bond. That's called dehydroadamantane. But does that produce a carbonyl group? No, elimination would form an alkene. So the IR should show a peak around 1650 cm-1. But the IR here is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So this can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that would require a better leaving group. Wait, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. Oh, but there's no carboxylic acid group here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure why the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone formed via some kind of pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol and then elimination to form a carbonyl. But in the starting material, we have 1,3-dibromide, which on elimination would form a diene, perhaps. Not directly a diol.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination, but here we have KOH, which is a base.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 group, as I thought before. So maybe product 1 is a diol. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is an ester. But how would an ester form from a dibromide? That doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a coupling. For example, a nucleophilic substitution where the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double elimination and forming a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure of the mechanism here.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about possible structures. If product 1 has a carbonyl, maybe it's a diketone. So 1,3-diketone adamantane. The NMR would show the carbonyl as a peak at around 210 ppm, but that's not mentioned here. The given NMR doesn't show a peak that high. So perhaps it's not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to some kind of hemiacetal or acetal group, but that's usually lower ppm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester, but I don't see how that would form from a dibromide. Maybe via substitution, but with what? Without an acid component, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a gem-diol, which then undergoes oxidation. But without an oxidizing agent, I don't see that happening.

Another thought: perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a conjugated diene, and then some other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some kind of elimination with two HBr molecules, but how? That would require a loss of HBr from each Br to form a double bond, but that gives an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each bromide to lose a proton and form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the Hofmann elimination. Hofmann elimination involves quaternary ammonium salts, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a rearrangement, like the Cope elimination, but that usually requires specific structures, such as 1,5-dienes.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the product is an epoxide, despite the IR not matching. Let's say product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it induces some ring-opening or further reaction.

Wait, but then what happens when an epoxide is treated with a Lewis acid? It could catalyze ring-opening, perhaps with a nucleophile. But in this case, product 2 is formed, and then product 3 is formed via ozonolysis.

But let me think further. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, so product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl-containing compounds.

But let's tie this back. If product 1 is an epoxide (but we have IR at 1720, so maybe an ester?), perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to make a table of the reaction steps.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
Step 2: product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2
Step 3: product 2 + ozone → product 3 (after workup with DMS)

The question is about the NMR of product 3, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps it would help to figure out each product step by step.

Let me start with product 1. The IR indicates a carbonyl. So possibly, product 1 is a ketone or ester.

But how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe via elimination of HBr and subsequent oxidation. But without an oxidizing agent, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via some mechanism I'm not familiar with.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzil-like structure, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol, which then tautomerizes or undergoes some rearrangement to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a cyclic ketone via some kind of elimination, but I can't visualize it.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone formed by the elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me imagine that: each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and upon elimination, each loss of HBr forms a double bond. Wait, but that would form a diene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group via a [2,3]-sigmatropic shift or some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but without an acid, how would that form? Unless the reaction is some kind of intramolecular reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Okay, perhaps I should move on to the next step, assuming product 1 is a ketone. Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, what could happen? Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but without an aromatic ring, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's used to catalyze an aldol condensation. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes aldol condensation, forming a larger ketone with a conjugated double bond. So product 2 would have a conjugated enone system.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone, which would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis of a conjugated enone would typically form two carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an enone, say, cyclohexenone or something similar, ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones or a ketone and an aldehyde, depending on the substitution.

But let's think about the structure. Since the starting material is adamantane, which is a cage structure, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Wait, but let's try to imagine product 3. After ozonolysis, the double bond would be cleaved. Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic ketone with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogens would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups. For example, the alpha protons. The coupling pattern would depend on their neighboring protons.

Wait, but the question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with D2O). So, perhaps it's a proton that's next to a carbonyl group, possibly in a conjugated system.

In ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond gives carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 had a double bond, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 was a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond between two carbons, ozonolysis would split it into two ketones.

But the exact structure is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more complex structure, such as a bicyclic diene, which upon ozonolysis gives a diketone.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible NMR of product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring protons.

In a typical case, a proton adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a ketone) would have coupling with adjacent protons. For example, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each proton would couple with the two adjacent in the same group and perhaps with others.

Wait, another scenario: if the structure after ozonolysis has a conjugated diene system, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a terminal aldehyde or ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone. The most deshielded proton would be the one adjacent to two carbonyl groups, maybe in a bridge structure.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis step, the workup is done with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is a mild reductant. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have two carbonyls.

Assuming product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene, product 3 would be a bridged bicyclic diketone.

So, the structure after ozonolysis would have two ketone groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one adjacent to both ketones, perhaps in a bridge position.

In that case, the proton would have coupling with two different sets of protons. Let's say it's a CH2 group between two ketones. Each proton on CH2 would couple with the other, giving a triplet (if two neighboring H's). But wait, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would couple with two equivalent H's on the same CH2 and maybe with H's from adjacent groups.

Wait, for example, if there's a structure like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R'-C=O

But that's a bit simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: if the proton is part of a CH2 group between two carbonyls, it would have neighboring H's on the same CH2 and perhaps others. So each H would have two neighboring H's on the same group, leading to a triplet. But if there are additional couplings, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, suppose the proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, it would couple with two H's from the CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not quite getting the exact structure. Let me think about the possible options for the coupling pattern.

The options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

For a proton that's coupled to two sets of non-equivalent protons, you could get a triplet of triplets (if each coupling is with two different protons, each with J1 and J2). Or, if it's coupled with two protons with the same J, it would be a triplet.

Wait, but in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each proton would couple with the two H's on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and perhaps with the adjacent CH2's H's, which could add more splitting.

But in such a case, each H would see two H's from the same group and two from the neighboring group. So each H would split into a doublet of doublets, perhaps.

But the options don't include doublet of doublets. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Wait, perhaps the proton is coupled with two different sets of two protons each, leading to a triplet of triplets. That would happen if each proton is coupled with two different groups, each with two H's.

Alternatively, if the proton is coupled with three different protons, each with different J values, it could lead to more complex splitting. But that's less likely here.

Wait, another possibility is that the proton is part of a CH2 group next to another CH2 group that's part of a larger structure. So each H would couple with two H's on its own CH2 and two H's on the adjacent CH2. If the coupling constants are all similar, this could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are different, it would be a doublet of triplets, but that's less likely.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. The most deshielded H is likely to be in a position where it's coupled to two different sets of two H's each. Let's say it's a CH2 group adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Each H would couple with two H's from each adjacent group. So for each adjacent group, two couplings, leading to triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridgehead H, which is coupled with two different H's on either side. But in adamantane derivatives, bridgehead H's are typically not present due to Bredt's rule, which disallows double bonds at bridgeheads. But in this case, it's after ozonolysis, which may form carbonyls.

Wait, in product 3, the structure might have a bridge with two carbonyl groups on either side, and the bridge H's would be the most deshielded.

So, the bridge H's would be adjacent to carbonyl groups on both sides. Each bridge H would have coupling with H's on the same bridge and maybe with H's on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group where each H is coupled with two H's from adjacent groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard. However, considering the options, a triplet of triplets would imply coupling with two different sets of two protons each, each with the same J value. Alternatively, a doublet of triplets implies coupling with two protons (giving a triplet) and another set (giving a doublet), which is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group which is itself adjacent to a carbonyl. So each H would couple with two H's on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and two H's on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). But this would give a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, considering the options, the coupling might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but another angle: the most deshielded H is part of a geminal diol, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton adjacent to two different double bonds, but that's less likely after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Wait, another thought: during ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the resulting carbonyl groups are formed. So any H's adjacent to the cleavage site would be next to carbonyl groups.

Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by a bridge. The bridge H's would be adjacent to carbonyls on both sides.

Each bridge H would be adjacent to two carbonyls, and perhaps each would have coupling with two H's on the bridge. For example, if the bridge is a CH2 group, each H would couple with the other H on the same CH2 (giving a triplet), and possibly with H's on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if the bridge is a CH2 group between two carbonyls, each H on CH2 would have coupling with the other H on the same CH2 (so triplet) and perhaps with H's on adjacent carbons. But if those adjacent H's are equivalent, it might not split further.

Alternatively, maybe the bridge is a CH group, but that's less likely. So, if it's a CH2 bridge between two carbonyls, each H on CH2 would couple with the other H, giving a triplet. But in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But the options include triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), etc.

Wait, perhaps the bridge H's are each coupled with two H's from adjacent groups. For example, each H on the bridge is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two H's. So each H would couple with two H's (giving a triplet) and another two H's (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's coupled with three different H's, leading to more splits, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded H in product 3 would be the one most downfield, which is likely to be near a carbonyl group. Suppose it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H would couple with the two H's on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So, each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with three different sets of protons, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would arise if each H is coupled with two sets of two H's each, each with the same J.

Alternatively, option C is doublet of triplets, which would happen if a H is coupled with two H's (giving a triplet) and another single H (giving a doublet). But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, if a H is coupled with two H's on one side (triplet) and another two H's on another side (another triplet), the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, considering all this, I'm leaning towards option B) triplet of triplets.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would see two H's on the same group (triplet) and two H's on the adjacent group (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Yes, that makes sense. So the coupling would be a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
- **Starting Material**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure with bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.
- **Reaction Conditions**: Heating with KOH at 240°C suggests a base-catalyzed reaction. Vicinal dihalides typically undergo elimination (E2) to form alkenes, but the IR spectrum of the product shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This indicates that the product is likely a ketone or ester.
- **NMR Analysis**: The product has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak suggests an OCH₂ group, and the IR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group. Thus, **product 1 is likely a ketone** derived from the elimination of two HBr molecules.

---

### Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with Aluminum Isopropoxide
- **Reagent**: Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃) is a Lewis acid, commonly used to catalyze reactions like aldol condensations or Friedel-Crafts alkylation/acylation.
- **Outcome**: Heating product 1 (a ketone) with Al(OiPr)₃ likely induces an aldol condensation, forming a conjugated enone (product 2). This enone contains a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2
- **Reagent**: Ozone (O₃) is used to cleave double bonds. When ozonolysis is performed at -78°C followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the double bond in product 2 is cleaved, forming two carbonyl groups in product 3.
- **Structure of Product 3**: Product 3 is a diketone, where the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to one or two carbonyl groups.

---

### Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen in Product 3
- The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to carbonyl groups. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group bridging two carbonyls. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with:
  1. The other hydrogen in the same CH₂ group (giving a triplet due to two equivalent couplings).
  2. Two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (giving another triplet).
- The combined coupling results in a **triplet of triplets** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

---

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
