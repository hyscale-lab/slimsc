Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relative motion of media and light, it's not just straightforward addition of velocities like in classical mechanics because of relativity. Oh wait, but the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? But wait, wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass, not in a vacuum.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where n is the index of refraction. So in the glass, the speed is c/n. But the glass itself is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. The light is traveling through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the light. So I think we need to consider the relative velocity between the light and the medium.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the light is moving through the glass. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam towards the observer. Wait, no, the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Or maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass—the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the beam, as seen in the lab frame, is moving at a certain speed, but the glass is moving towards the observer, so from the lab's point of view, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.

So the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. But how does that translate to the lab frame?

Wait, but according to special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, u would be the speed of the light in the glass's frame, and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, let me think. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So using the velocity addition formula, the speed u' observed in the lab would be (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but u is c/n. So plugging that in: u' = (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v )/c² ].

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Wait, let me do the denominator correctly. Because (c/n)*v is (v c)/n. Then divide by c squared, you get v/(n c).

So the denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c).

So the entire expression is:

u' = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v)/(n c) ) )

Wait, I can multiply numerator and denominator by n c to simplify.

Numerator: (c + n v)/n * n c = (c + n v) * c.

Denominator: (n c + v)/(n c) * n c = (n c + v).

So u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v ) 

But wait, wait. Let me check the math again. Maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, let's write it differently. Let me compute u' as [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

Which is [ (c + n v ) / (n) ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ]

So the denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So putting it all together:

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Which equals [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ].

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels out. So [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, (c + n v) = n v + c, and (n c + v) is the same as c n + v. So the numerator is (c + n v) * c = c² + c n v.

Denominator is n c + v. So u' = (c² + c n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but let's factor out c from numerator and denominator. Let me see:

Numerator: c (c + n v) 

Denominator: v + n c = n c + v. So same as c (n) + v.

Wait, perhaps we can factor c:

u' = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, let's factor numerator and denominator. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because in the lab frame, the light is moving through a medium that's moving itself. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, another approach: the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light's speed in the glass is c/n, but relative to the lab frame, how does it look?

Alternatively, think about it as the medium (glass) is moving, and light's speed in the medium is c/n. To find the speed as observed in the lab, which is moving relative to the medium.

Wait, but in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So using the velocity addition formula, the lab frame (which is moving at velocity v relative to the medium) would see the light's speed as (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c²), where u is the light's speed in the medium, and v' is the relative velocity between the medium and lab.

Wait, no, the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the medium.

But the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the object's speed in the medium's frame, and v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, so u (light's speed in medium) is c/n. v is the medium's speed relative to lab, which is v (same direction as the light). So plugging into the formula:

u' = (c/n + v) / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is same as before: [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify: [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but n c + v is the same as v + n c. So the numerator is c(c + n v) = c^2 + n v c.

So u' = (c^2 + n c v)/(n c + v )

We can factor c from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c n + v = v + c n.

Wait, perhaps we can factor c from denominator: c (n) + v. Not sure.

Wait, but let's divide numerator and denominator by c:

u' = [c (c + n v)] / [c (n) + v ]

= [ c (c + n v) ] / [n c + v ]

Hmm, but that might not help much. Let me compute this expression for u':

u' = [c^2 + c n v ] / [n c + v ]

Hmm, but the options are all in terms of n and v, not c. But since c=1 in this problem, that simplifies things.

So substituting c=1, equation becomes:

u' = [1 + n v ] / [n + v ]

Which is (1 + n v) / (n + v) )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that would be the speed of the light in the glass as observed in the lab.

Wait, but wait, another thought: The speed of light in the glass is always c/n, regardless of the motion of the glass. Because the speed of light in a medium is a function of the medium's properties, not its motion. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be c/n, which would be 1/n since c=1.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier result. Which is correct?

Wait a second, perhaps I'm confusing the frame of reference. In the glass's rest frame, the light propagates at c/n. But if the glass is moving, in the lab frame, the light's speed isn't just c/n because the medium itself is moving.

Wait, no. Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion relative to the observer. Wait, no, in reality, the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties, and it doesn't depend on the medium's motion relative to the observer. Wait, but that's in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between Galilean and relativistic addition. Oh, right, in relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's in a vacuum. When light is traveling through a medium, the speed is c/n, and that would be measured relative to the medium's frame.

Wait, but how does that change when the medium is moving relative to the lab frame? Because in the lab frame, the medium is moving, so the speed of light relative to the lab would be affected.

So I think the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the initial calculation gives (1 +n v )/(n + v ), which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the glass is stationary. Then the speed would be 1/n. So the formula should reduce to 1/n when v=0. Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v )/(n + v ). When v=0, it becomes (1 +0)/(n +0 )=1/n. That's correct.

If the glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light. So, for example, if v is a small fraction of c, the observed speed would be a bit higher than 1/n.

Wait, but if the glass is moving in the opposite direction, v is negative. Hmm, but the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam. Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab frame would see the glass moving towards them, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, same direction.

In that case, the velocity addition formula applies as I did before.

So the correct answer should be option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1, which would be the speed of light in a vacuum. But the light is in glass, so it's slower than 1. So option B can't be right unless v is making it so. But when v=0, option B would be 1, which is not correct because the speed would be 1/n, which is less than 1.

So the conclusion is that option A is the correct answer.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and it is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{medium}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. However, since the glass is moving relative to the laboratory frame, we must account for the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u' = \frac{c (c + n v)}{n c + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, consider the limiting cases:
1. When \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches the expression \( \frac{1 + 0}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} \).
2. When \( v \) is small compared to \( c \), the expression correctly accounts for the relativistic addition of velocities.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}}
\]

Wait, but u is c/n. So plugging that in: u' = (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v )/c² ].

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Wait, let me do the denominator correctly. Because (c/n)*v is (v c)/n. Then divide by c squared, you get v/(n c).

So the denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c).

So the entire expression is:

u' = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v)/(n c) ) )

Wait, I can multiply numerator and denominator by n c to simplify.

Numerator: (c + n v)/n * n c = (c + n v) * c.

But wait, wait. Let me check the math again. Maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, let's write it differently. Let me compute u' as [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

So the denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So putting it all together:

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Which equals [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ].

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels out. So [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, (c + n v) = n v + c, and (n c + v) is the same as c n + v. So the numerator is (c + n v) * c = c² + c n v.

Denominator is n c + v. So u' = (c² + c n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but let's factor out c from numerator and denominator. Let me see:

Numerator: c (c + n v) 

Denominator: v + n c = n c + v. So same as c (n) + v.

Wait, perhaps we can factor c:

u' = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but n c + v is the same as v + n c. So the numerator is c(c + n v) = c^2 + n v c.

So u' = (c^2 + n c v)/(n c + v )

We can factor c from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c n + v = v + c n.

Wait, perhaps we can factor c from denominator: c (n) + v. Not sure.

So the correct answer should be option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1, which would be the speed of light in a vacuum. But the light is in glass, so it's slower than 1. So option B can't be right unless v is making it so. But when v=0, option B would be 1, which is not correct because the speed would be 1/n, which is less than 1.

So the conclusion is that option A is the correct answer.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and it is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{medium}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. However, since the glass is moving relative to the laboratory frame, we must account for the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u' = \frac{c (c + n v)}{n c + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, consider the limiting cases:
1. When \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches the expression \( \frac{1 + 0}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} \).
2. When \( v \) is small compared to \( c \), the expression correctly accounts for the relativistic addition of velocities.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}}
\]

Answer: A
