Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I need to parse that. I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So, (3i, 4) would be a two-component vector where the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So that's like:

ψ = [3i; 4]. Right, that makes sense. Now, the spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. So σ_y is the matrix:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Got it.

The expectation value of an observable is calculated as <ψ| S_y |ψ>. So I need to compute that. Let me write out the steps.

First, I'll write out ψ as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Then, the conjugate transpose (bra) ψ† would be [ -3 (since 3i becomes -3i when conjugated) , 4 ].

So ψ† is [ -3i*, 4 ] but wait, 3i is a complex number, so its conjugate is -3i. Wait, no: 3i is (3)(i), so the conjugate is 3*(-i) = -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait no, wait: ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† would be the row vector [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is 3i, its complex conjugate is -3i. 4 is real, so it's 4. So ψ† is [ -3i , 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. So let me compute S_y first.

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So to compute the expectation value <S_y>, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ.

Let me compute that expression. Let's break it down:

ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i; 4 ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute without the (ħ/2) factor first and then multiply it at the end. So let me compute the matrix product first.

First, compute the product σ_y * ψ.

σ_y is the 2x2 matrix, ψ is 2x1. So their product is:

[0*(3i) + (-i)*(4), ... ] Wait, no, matrix multiplication is rows of first matrix times columns of second.

Wait, σ_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Multiplying by ψ = [3i,4]^T:

So first entry of the resulting vector is (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second entry is (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4) = 3i² + 0. Since i² is -1, this is 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * ψ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so ψ† * (σ_y ψ) is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

Compute that:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So the sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

But wait, this is the product of ψ† and σ_y ψ. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 * ħ) / 2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. Hmm, that doesn't match my result here. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the matrix multiplication.

Wait, when I calculated σ_y * ψ:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i. That seems correct.

Second component: (i)*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3. That's correct.

Then ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

So first term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Sum is -24. Then multiplied by ħ/2 gives (ħ/2)(-24) = -12 ħ.

But the given options have a denominator of 25. So I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine the initial state vector.

Wait, wait, the initial state is (3i, 4). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So maybe I forgot to normalize it. Because the coefficients might not form a unit vector.

Wait, because the given state is (3i,4), but the norm is sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt( (9)(1) + 16 ) = sqrt(25) =5.

Oh right! So I forgot to normalize the state. That's probably where I went wrong. Because the state given is not normalized. So ψ is [3i;4], and its norm is 5, so the actual state is ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4].

Wait wait no, the question says the spin state is (3i,4), so perhaps that's the state vector, but maybe it's not normalized. So when calculating expectation values, I have to use the normalized state. Because expectation values require the state to be a unit vector.

So to compute <S_y>, I need to use ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4].

Ah, that makes sense because when I computed S_y, I didn't account for the normalization factor. So let's redo the calculation with the normalized state.

So ψ = [3i;4] / 5. So ψ is (1/5) [3i;4].

Then ψ† is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So, let's redo the calculation.

Compute S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So ψ† S_y ψ = (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) σ_y * (1/5) [3i;4]

Which is (ħ/2) * (1/25) [ -3i,4 ] σ_y [3i;4 ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out the 1/25.

So first, let's compute the matrix product σ_y [3i;4].

As before, σ_y [3i;4] is [ -4i; -3 ]

Now, [ -3i,4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So first term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So now, putting it all together:

ψ† S_y ψ = (1/5)(-3i,4) * (ħ/2) * (σ_y) * (1/5)(3i;4) 

Wait, no, actually, the ψ† is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ], and S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and ψ is (1/5) [3i;4].

So the product is:

(1/5) [ -3i,4 ] * (ħ/2) σ_y * (1/5) [3i;4 ]

Which is (ħ/2) * (1/5)^2 [ -3i,4 ] σ_y [3i;4 ]

Which is (ħ/2) * (1/25) [ -3i,4 ] σ_y [3i;4 ]

So [ -3i,4 ] σ_y [3i;4 ] is -24 as before.

So the expectation value is:

(ħ/2) * (1/25) * (-24) = (-24 ħ) / (2*25) ) = (-12 ħ) /25.

Wait, that's -12 ħ /25. Which matches option A.

So the correct answer would be option A: -12*hbar/25.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin State Normalization**:  
   The given state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin Operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value Formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \psi_{\text{normalized}}.
   \]

4. **Matrix Multiplications**:  
   - Compute \( \sigma_y \psi_{\text{normalized}} \):  
     \[
     \sigma_y \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - Compute \( \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{normalized}}) \):  
     \[
     \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{normalized}}) = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
     Breaking this down:  
     - First term: \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12 \).  
     - Second term: \( 4(-3) = -12 \).  
     - Sum: \( -12 + (-12) = -24 \).

5. **Final Expectation Value**:  
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{25} \cdot (-24) = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
