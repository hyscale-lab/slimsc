Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. I need to find the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. 

Wait, p orbital means l=1 for each electron. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Oh right, that notation is |l1, l2, l, m>, so l is the total orbital angular momentum, which is 1+1=2, and m is -1. 

So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, which are the individual z-components of each electron's angular momentum. Each Lz will have eigenvalues of mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, the measurement is for both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So each must have m=-1, but wait each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. 

So for electron 1, L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. Same for electron 2. The joint state is a coupled state, which probably is a combination of the product states of the individual states. 

Wait, but the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So this is a state with total angular momentum L=2 and Mz=-1. How does this state relate to the product of individual states? 

I remember that when combining two angular momenta, you can express the coupled states in terms of the product of individual states. The expansion coefficients are given by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of |l1=1, m1> |l2=1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m_total = -1. 

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are: (-1, 0), (0, -1). Because m1 must be between -1 and +1. So for each of these, there's a term in the expansion. 

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l1=1, m1 and l2=1, m2 into L=2, M=-1. 

The expansion would be something like:

|1 1 2 -1> = Σ [ ( coefficients ) |m1, m2> ]

But which pairs (m1, m2) contribute? They must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

Wait, because 1 + (-2) would be -1, but wait, m can't be less than -l. So m2 can't be -2 since l2=1. So only the two pairs I mentioned before.

Now, what are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these? 

I think the C.G. coefficients for |l1 m1> |l2 m2> to |L M> are needed. Let me think: The general formula is complicated, but for specific cases, maybe I can remember some. 

For coupling l1=1 and l2=1 to L=2, M=-1.

The state |1 1 2 -1> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. 

So the possible product states are |m1, m2> = | -1, 0 > and |0, -1 >.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each of these is sqrt( (something) ).

Wait, I recall that for |1, m1> |1, m2> to make |2, M>, the coefficients can be determined. 

For M = m1 + m2 = -1. 

The possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

The coefficients can be found from standard tables or by the formula. 

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) is sqrt( (2 - 1 + 1)/(2*(2+1)) )^(1/2) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe better to look it up mentally.

Alternatively, I can think about the expansion. For L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>?

Wait, no, because when you have L=2, the states are built from the possible combinations. The coefficient for each product state can be found using the formula:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = sqrt( [ ( 2 l1 + 1 )( 2 l2 + 1 ) ] / ( 2 L + 1 ) ) * [ ... something involving factorials and signs ... ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to recall that for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the L=2 state can be written as a linear combination of the product states.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Since the state is |1,1,2,-1>, meaning that the total angular momentum L is 2 and M is -1, it must be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So, as I thought before, the two product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how are these combined in the Clebsch-Gordan expansion?

I think the expansion is: 

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( 2/(3) ) | -1, 0 > + sqrt( 1/3 ) | 0, -1 >.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of the general case. For combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M.

I remember that the states |L, M> are built from the product states |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, with m1 + m2 = M. 

For specific cases, like when l1=l2=1 and L=2, the coefficients can be determined.

From what I remember, the state |2, 1> would be |1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1>, but normalized.

But for |2, 0>, it's a different combination. Let me think. 

Wait, perhaps looking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

I think for L=2, M=-1, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> ?

Wait, no, I think it's:

Wait, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric. Let me think: when M is positive, the coefficients are for m1 > m2, and when M is negative, it might switch.

Wait, another approach: the state |L, M> is a combination of all |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = M.

So for L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are -1 and 0.

The expansion is:

|2,-1> = c1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + c2 |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Now, normalization requires that |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1.

I think I can find the coefficients using the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The formula is:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = 

sqrt( [ (2L + 1)(l1 + l2 - L)(l1 + l2 + L + 1) ] / [ (l1 + l2 + L)(l1 + l2 - L +1) (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ] )

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the recursion relations.

Wait, another approach: for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible L values are 0,1,2.

The state |2, -1> must be a combination of |1, -1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1, -1>.

The coefficient can be found from the generating function or some symmetry.

Alternatively, I remember that for L=2, M=-2: that would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>, but that's not our case.

Wait, perhaps looking for a pattern. For two p orbitals, the L=2 states are:

|2, 2> = |1,1> |1,1> (coefficient 1)

|2, 1> = sqrt( (2/3) ) |1,1> |1,0> + sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,0> |1,1>

|2, 0> = sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,1> |1,-1> + sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,-1> |1,1> + sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,0> |1,0> 

Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact coefficients.

Wait, the question is about the joint probability of L1z and L2z being -ħ each. So the product state would have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So the product state is | -1, -1 >.

But our coupled state |2,-1> is a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >.

So if the state is |2,-1>, then when we expand it, it's a sum of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >.

So the product state | -1, -1 > is not part of this coupled state. So the amplitude for | -1, -1 > in the coupled state |2,-1> is zero.

Therefore, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but that would mean the probability is zero. So the answer is D) 0.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is |2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1,m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So when you're in this state, what is the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1? Since the state doesn't include that component, the probability is zero.

So the joint measurement of L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ would have zero probability.

Therefore, the answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$. 

For a single electron in a $p$ orbital ($l=1$), the possible $m$ values are $-1, 0, +1$, and the eigenvalue of $L_{z}$ is $m\hbar$. The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ represents a total angular momentum $L=2$ with $M=-1$. This state is a linear combination of the product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. 

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients describe how these product states combine to form the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$. However, the product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$ does not satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$, so it is not part of the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Therefore, the amplitude of $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$ in the coupled state is zero.

Since the probability of a state is proportional to the square of its amplitude, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero. 

Thus, the answer is:

But which pairs (m1, m2) contribute? They must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

Wait, because 1 + (-2) would be -1, but wait, m can't be less than -l. So m2 can't be -2 since l2=1. So only the two pairs I mentioned before.

Now, what are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these? 

I think the C.G. coefficients for |l1 m1> |l2 m2> to |L M> are needed. Let me think: The general formula is complicated, but for specific cases, maybe I can remember some.

The state |1 1 2 -1> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

For M = m1 + m2 = -1. 

The possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

The coefficients can be found from standard tables or by the formula. 

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) is sqrt( (2 - 1 + 1)/(2*(2+1)) )^(1/2) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe better to look it up mentally.

Alternatively, I can think about the expansion. For L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>?

Wait, no, because when you have L=2, the states are built from the possible combinations. The coefficient for each product state can be found using the formula:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = sqrt( [ ( 2 l1 + 1 )( 2 l2 + 1 ) ] / ( 2 L + 1 ) ) * [ ... something involving factorials and signs ... ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to recall that for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the L=2 state can be written as a linear combination of the product states.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Since the state is |1,1,2,-1>, meaning that the total angular momentum L is 2 and M is -1, it must be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So, as I thought before, the two product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how are these combined in the Clebsch-Gordan expansion?

I think the expansion is: 

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( 2/(3) ) | -1, 0 > + sqrt( 1/3 ) | 0, -1 >.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of the general case. For combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M.

I remember that the states |L, M> are built from the product states |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, with m1 + m2 = M.

I think for L=2, M=-1, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> ?

Wait, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric. Let me think: when M is positive, the coefficients are for m1 > m2, and when M is negative, it might switch.

Wait, another approach: the state |L, M> is a combination of all |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = M.

So for L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are -1 and 0.

The expansion is:

|2,-1> = c1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + c2 |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Now, normalization requires that |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1.

I think I can find the coefficients using the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The formula is:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = 

sqrt( [ (2L + 1)(l1 + l2 - L)(l1 + l2 + L + 1) ] / [ (l1 + l2 + L)(l1 + l2 - L +1) (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ] )

|2, 2> = |1,1> |1,1> (coefficient 1)

|2, 1> = sqrt( (2/3) ) |1,1> |1,0> + sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,0> |1,1>

|2, 0> = sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,1> |1,-1> + sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,-1> |1,1> + sqrt( (1/3) ) |1,0> |1,0>

So the product state | -1, -1 > is not part of this coupled state. So the amplitude for | -1, -1 > in the coupled state |2,-1> is zero.

Therefore, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but that would mean the probability is zero. So the answer is D) 0.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is |2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1,m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So when you're in this state, what is the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1? Since the state doesn't include that component, the probability is zero.

So the joint measurement of L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ would have zero probability.

Therefore, the answer is D) 0.
