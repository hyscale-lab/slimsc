Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the setup: There are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—it's three times shorter than Planet_2's. And both have circular orbits. The stars they orbit have the same radii, but different masses: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one more. The options give different probabilities, so I need to figure out which is higher.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is roughly given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - e²))^0.5, where R_p is the planet's radius, a is the semi-major axis, and e is the eccentricity. But since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so the probability simplifies to P = R_p / a. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is a bit different. Oh right, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's alignment. The geometric probability is (R*/a) * (1 + (R_p/a))^-1, but if R_p << a, then it approximates to (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius. So the transit probability is higher when a is smaller, since R* is in the numerator and a is in the denominator.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is given by (R_*/a) times some function, but also depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. So the main factors are the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. A smaller a (closer orbit) means a higher probability because the planet is more likely to pass in front from our perspective.

But wait, let's get the exact formula. I think the probability P is approximately equal to (R_star / a) for small planets, but more accurately, it's the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the orbit's disk. So P = (π (R_star)^2) / (π (a)^2 (1 - e²)) ) which simplifies to (R_star / a)^2 / (1 - e²). But since e is zero, it's (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the probability inversely proportional to a squared. But I must be mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability is actually the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a). Because the region where the planet can cause a transit is a circle with diameter R_star, and the orbital area is a circle with radius a. So the probability is (R_star / (2a)) squared? Or wait, no, the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can transit—so it's the area of the star divided by the area of the orbit in the sky. So it's (π (R_star)^2) / (π (2a)^2 ), which is (R_star / (2a))². But wait, that would imply it's (R_star / (2a)) squared, which is (R_star^2)/(4a²). But then, if a is in astronomical units, etc., but in this case, both stars have the same radius, so that part is same.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the formula. Oh, wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to remember. The transit probability is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately (R_star / a). But wait, actually, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star, so perhaps the formula is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + ...)), but no, perhaps it's more like the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but in a certain way.

Wait, another approach: the probability depends on the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the size of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. So the angular size of the star is (R_star / D), where D is the distance to the star. The angular size of the orbit is (a / D) * 2, because the semi-major axis is a, so the diameter is 2a. So the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, which is (R_star / (2a)). So P ≈ (R_star) / (2a). Because if R_star is much smaller than 2a, then the probability is small, but if a is small, R_star/(2a) is larger.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (R_planet / R_star)^0.5)) )? No, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, but that's a different concept.

Alternatively, I've heard that the probability of a transit is roughly (R_star / a). So for each planet, the probability is (R*/a) for the star's radius and the planet's semi-major axis.

So in this problem, both stars have the same radius, R*. So the probability is inversely proportional to a, the semi-major axis.

Wait, but what determines the semi-major axis? The orbital period and the mass of the star. Because orbital period is given by Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M* + M_p)) ) a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M*, M_p can be neglected. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_* )) a³.

We can rearrange this to find a in terms of P and M*.

So a³ = (G M_* P²) / (4 π² )

So a = [ (G M_* P²) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

But Wait, G is a constant, and 4 pi^2 is another constant.

But for the purpose of comparing a for Planet_1 and Planet_2, let's compute the ratio of a1 to a2.

Let’s denote M1 as the mass of the star with Planet_1, and M2 as the mass of the star with Planet_2. From the question, M1 = 2 M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 / 3, since it's three times shorter. Let's let P1 = P2/3.

So for Planet_1, a1³ = (G M1 (P1)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Similarly, for Planet_2, a2³ = (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Taking the ratio a1/a2:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ (G M1 (P1)^2 ) / same denominator ] / [ (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / same denominator ]

So (a1/a2)^3 = (M1 / M2 ) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

We know that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3.

Substituting:

= (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )

= 2 * ( (P2² /9) / P2² )

= 2 * (1/9 )

= 2/9

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

What is (2/9)^(1/3)? Let me compute that.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 = 0.216; 0.605^3 ≈ 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period and a more massive star, its a is smaller.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since both stars have the same R*, the probability for Planet_1 is (R*/a1), and for Planet_2 it is (R*/a2).

So the ratio of P1 to P2 is (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3), so a2/a1 is (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3). What's cube root of 4.5? 4.5 is between 1.5^3=3.375 and 1.6^3=4.096 and 1.7^3=4.913. So cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 → which means Planet_1 has about 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Wait, no, wait. Because P1 is (R*/a1), and P2 is (R*/a2). So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1. Which is (9/2)^(1/3). Since 9/2 is 4.5, as before. So this ratio is about 1.65, so P1 is 1.65 times P2. That would mean Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation. Because if a1 is smaller than a2, then R*/a1 is bigger than R*/a2, so P1 is bigger than P2. So yes, Planet_1 has higher transit probability.

So the researchers would prefer the one with higher probability, which is Planet_1. So looking at the options, which one says Planet_1 is preferred, with a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 higher.

So according to our calculation, P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2, so Planet_1 is preferred. So options C or D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the earlier steps, I assumed the transit probability P is proportional to R*/a. But is that correct?

I think I might have made a mistake in the transit probability formula. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for the transit probability is (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximately R* / a.

Wait, but actually, the formula for the probability is (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (R_p / R*)) )^(1/2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source I recall says that the transit probability is roughly (R*/a) * [(1) / (1 + (a_p / a) ) ] where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm mixing terms.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the fraction of the star's disk that the planet can cover when passing in front. The probability depends on the alignment between the planet's orbit and our line of sight. The probability is given by:

P = (R_star / a) * (some geometric factor).

The exact probability is P = [ (R_star + R_planet) / a ]^2 * [ (1 + (R_planet / R_star) ) / (1 + (R_planet / R_star) ) ] or something like that. No, perhaps it's better to refer to the formula as:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_p / R_star)) / (1 + (R_p / R_star)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the area of the star's disk (as seen from Earth) divided by the area of the planet's orbit (as seen from Earth). So the area of the star is π(R*)², and the area of the orbit is π(a)^2 (since the orbit is circular with radius a). So the probability is (R*^2) / (a^2) → (R*/a)^2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a is the semi-major axis, the area of the orbit is πa², but the star's disk is much smaller. So the probability is (R* / (2a))^2, since the orbit's radius is a, so the diameter is 2a, and the star's diameter is 2R*. So the probability is (R* / (2a))² * (some factor due to alignment), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ). But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this approximates to R_star/(a). So my initial approach was correct.

Therefore, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a. Since R* is the same for both stars, the probability for each planet is inversely proportional to a.

So, given that a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So, the transit probability ratio is P1/P2 = a2/a1.

Earlier calculation found a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2. Thus, Planet_1 has a higher probability, so the researchers should observe Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So according to our calculation, the correct option is C, which says ~1.65 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated (a1/a2).

Let me re-calculate (a1/a2).

We have:

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Take the ratio:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 / 3.

So:

= (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2)^2 )

= 2 * ( P2^2 / 9 ) / P2^2

= 2 * (1/9 )

= 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Thus, P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

So P1 = R*/a1 = (R*/a2) * (a2/a1 ) = P2 * (a2/a1 )

But a2/a1 is 1.65, so P1 = 1.65 * P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher probability than Planet_2.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \).

### Step 1: Relating semi-major axis to orbital period and stellar mass
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is given by:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. Taking the ratio of \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}
\]

Given \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), we substitute:

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit probability ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65 \), we find:

\[
P_1 \approx 1.65P_2
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing it. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**

Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the setup: There are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—it's three times shorter than Planet_2's. And both have circular orbits. The stars they orbit have the same radii, but different masses: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one more. The options give different probabilities, so I need to figure out which is higher.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is roughly given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - e²))^0.5, where R_p is the planet's radius, a is the semi-major axis, and e is the eccentricity. But since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so the probability simplifies to P = R_p / a. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is a bit different. Oh right, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's alignment. The geometric probability is (R*/a) * (1 + (R_p/a))^-1, but if R_p << a, then it approximates to (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius. So the transit probability is higher when a is smaller, since R* is in the numerator and a is in the denominator.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is given by (R_*/a) times some function, but also depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. So the main factors are the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. A smaller a (closer orbit) means a higher probability because the planet is more likely to pass in front from our perspective.

But wait, let's get the exact formula. I think the probability P is approximately equal to (R_star / a) for small planets, but more accurately, it's the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the orbit's disk. So P = (π (R_star)^2) / (π (a)^2 (1 - e²)) ) which simplifies to (R_star / a)^2 / (1 - e²). But since e is zero, it's (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the probability inversely proportional to a squared. But I must be mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability is actually the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a). Because the region where the planet can cause a transit is a circle with diameter R_star, and the orbital area is a circle with radius a. So the probability is (R_star / (2a)) squared? Or wait, no, the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can transit—so it's the area of the star divided by the area of the orbit in the sky. So it's (π (R_star)^2) / (π (2a)^2 ), which is (R_star / (2a))². But wait, that would imply it's (R_star / (2a)) squared, which is (R_star^2)/(4a²). But then, if a is in astronomical units, etc., but in this case, both stars have the same radius, so that part is same.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the formula. Oh, wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to remember. The transit probability is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately (R_star / a). But wait, actually, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star, so perhaps the formula is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + ...)), but no, perhaps it's more like the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but in a certain way.

Wait, another approach: the probability depends on the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the size of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. So the angular size of the star is (R_star / D), where D is the distance to the star. The angular size of the orbit is (a / D) * 2, because the semi-major axis is a, so the diameter is 2a. So the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, which is (R_star / (2a)). So P ≈ (R_star) / (2a). Because if R_star is much smaller than 2a, then the probability is small, but if a is small, R_star/(2a) is larger.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (R_planet / R_star)^0.5)) )? No, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, but that's a different concept.

Alternatively, I've heard that the probability of a transit is roughly (R_star / a). So for each planet, the probability is (R*/a) for the star's radius and the planet's semi-major axis.

So in this problem, both stars have the same radius, R*. So the probability is inversely proportional to a, the semi-major axis.

Wait, but what determines the semi-major axis? The orbital period and the mass of the star. Because orbital period is given by Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M* + M_p)) ) a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M*, M_p can be neglected. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_* )) a³.

We can rearrange this to find a in terms of P and M*.

So a³ = (G M_* P²) / (4 π² )

So a = [ (G M_* P²) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

But Wait, G is a constant, and 4 pi^2 is another constant.

But for the purpose of comparing a for Planet_1 and Planet_2, let's compute the ratio of a1 to a2.

Let’s denote M1 as the mass of the star with Planet_1, and M2 as the mass of the star with Planet_2. From the question, M1 = 2 M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 / 3, since it's three times shorter. Let's let P1 = P2/3.

So for Planet_1, a1³ = (G M1 (P1)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Similarly, for Planet_2, a2³ = (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Taking the ratio a1/a2:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ (G M1 (P1)^2 ) / same denominator ] / [ (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / same denominator ]

So (a1/a2)^3 = (M1 / M2 ) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

We know that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3.

Substituting:

= (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )

= 2 * ( (P2² /9) / P2² )

= 2 * (1/9 )

= 2/9

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

What is (2/9)^(1/3)? Let me compute that.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 = 0.216; 0.605^3 ≈ 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period and a more massive star, its a is smaller.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since both stars have the same R*, the probability for Planet_1 is (R*/a1), and for Planet_2 it is (R*/a2).

So the ratio of P1 to P2 is (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3), so a2/a1 is (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3). What's cube root of 4.5? 4.5 is between 1.5^3=3.375 and 1.6^3=4.096 and 1.7^3=4.913. So cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 → which means Planet_1 has about 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Wait, no, wait. Because P1 is (R*/a1), and P2 is (R*/a2). So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1. Which is (9/2)^(1/3). Since 9/2 is 4.5, as before. So this ratio is about 1.65, so P1 is 1.65 times P2. That would mean Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation. Because if a1 is smaller than a2, then R*/a1 is bigger than R*/a2, so P1 is bigger than P2. So yes, Planet_1 has higher transit probability.

So the researchers would prefer the one with higher probability, which is Planet_1. So looking at the options, which one says Planet_1 is preferred, with a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 higher.

So according to our calculation, P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2, so Planet_1 is preferred. So options C or D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the earlier steps, I assumed the transit probability P is proportional to R*/a. But is that correct?

I think I might have made a mistake in the transit probability formula. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for the transit probability is (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximately R* / a.

Wait, but actually, the formula for the probability is (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (R_p / R*)) )^(1/2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source I recall says that the transit probability is roughly (R*/a) * [(1) / (1 + (a_p / a) ) ] where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm mixing terms.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the fraction of the star's disk that the planet can cover when passing in front. The probability depends on the alignment between the planet's orbit and our line of sight. The probability is given by:

P = (R_star / a) * (some geometric factor).

The exact probability is P = [ (R_star + R_planet) / a ]^2 * [ (1 + (R_planet / R_star) ) / (1 + (R_planet / R_star) ) ] or something like that. No, perhaps it's better to refer to the formula as:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_p / R_star)) / (1 + (R_p / R_star)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the area of the star's disk (as seen from Earth) divided by the area of the planet's orbit (as seen from Earth). So the area of the star is π(R*)², and the area of the orbit is π(a)^2 (since the orbit is circular with radius a). So the probability is (R*^2) / (a^2) → (R*/a)^2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a is the semi-major axis, the area of the orbit is πa², but the star's disk is much smaller. So the probability is (R* / (2a))^2, since the orbit's radius is a, so the diameter is 2a, and the star's diameter is 2R*. So the probability is (R* / (2a))² * (some factor due to alignment), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ). But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this approximates to R_star/(a). So my initial approach was correct.

Therefore, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a. Since R* is the same for both stars, the probability for each planet is inversely proportional to a.

So, given that a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So, the transit probability ratio is P1/P2 = a2/a1.

Earlier calculation found a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2. Thus, Planet_1 has a higher probability, so the researchers should observe Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So according to our calculation, the correct option is C, which says ~1.65 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated (a1/a2).

Let me re-calculate (a1/a2).

We have:

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Take the ratio:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 / 3.

So:

= (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2)^2 )

= 2 * ( P2^2 / 9 ) / P2^2

= 2 * (1/9 )

= 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Thus, P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

So P1 = R*/a1 = (R*/a2) * (a2/a1 ) = P2 * (a2/a1 )

But a2/a1 is 1.65, so P1 = 1.65 * P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher probability than Planet_2.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \).

### Step 1: Relating semi-major axis to orbital period and stellar mass
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is given by:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. Taking the ratio of \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}
\]

Given \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), we substitute:

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit probability ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65 \), we find:

\[
P_1 \approx 1.65P_2
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing it. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
