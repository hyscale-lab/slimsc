Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Oh right, Pauli matrices are those 2x2 matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ · n would be a dot product, meaning the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the equation det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, for Pauli matrices, I remember that each σ_i has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So if H is a scaled version of a Pauli matrix, then maybe the eigenvalues would scale accordingly.

Wait, but here H isn't just one Pauli matrix, it's a combination σ · n. But since n is a unit vector, the sum σ · n is equivalent to the Pauli matrices in some direction. Oh right, σ · n is the same as the Pauli matrix in the direction of n. So H would be ε times a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1. So the eigenvalues of H would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, right? So if you have a matrix like H = a σ · n, where a is a scalar, then the eigenvalues would be a times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, multiplying by a scalar a gives eigenvalues ±a.

In this case, a is ε. So the eigenvalues should be ε and -ε. Let me look at the options. Option B is +ε, -ε. Option C is with hbar over 2, which I don't think is right because the Pauli matrices usually have eigenvalues without factors of hbar.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices are scaled in terms of spin. Spin operators are (σ/2) times ħ. Oh right! Because the spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2) σ, right? Because the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2. So if H is ε σ · n, then the operator H would have eigenvalues ± ε because each Pauli term is multiplied by ε. But wait, wait another thought: if the Pauli matrices are σ_i and their eigenvalues are ±1, then σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. So H = ε (σ · n) would have eigenvalues ε * 1 and ε * (-1), so ±ε. That makes sense.

So looking at the options, option B is ±ε. Option C includes ħ, but in the problem statement, ε is given as an energy constant, so I don't think ħ comes into play here. Because the Pauli matrices are unit matrices in a certain way, so their eigenvalues are ±1. So I think the correct eigenvalues are ±ε, so option B is correct.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices and \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by recognizing that \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a combination of the Pauli matrices in the direction of \( \vec{n} \). Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), and since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) also has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

When multiplied by the scalar \( \varepsilon \), which is an energy constant, the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This corresponds to option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A (\( \pm 1 \)) does not account for the scaling by \( \varepsilon \).
- Option C (\( \pm \varepsilon \hbar/2 \)) introduces an unnecessary factor of \( \hbar/2 \), which is not present in the given Hamiltonian.
- Option D (\( \pm \hbar/2 \)) is unrelated to the problem, as it does not involve the parameter \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Answer: B
