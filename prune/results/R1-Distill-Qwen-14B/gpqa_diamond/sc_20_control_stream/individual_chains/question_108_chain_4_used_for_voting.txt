Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, paramagnetic coupling term—oh right, that's probably the term in the Hamiltonian due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. And the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels when an electron transitions, emitting or absorbing a photon.

The setup: the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis (so that's the z-direction), and it's 1 Tesla. The problem mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for the orbital angular momentum, but in the context of paramagnetism, I think the main contributor is the spin magnetic dipole interaction. So wait, maybe m here refers to the spin magnetic quantum number, which is ±1/2. But the question says small values, so perhaps m is small in magnitude. But I'm a bit confused here, maybe I should think more about the problem.

The problem compares the paramagnetic coupling term (which I'll call H') with the transition energy ΔE. So I need to find the ratio of these two terms and see which is larger.

Let me think about the paramagnetic coupling term. The Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is the Zeeman term, which is H' = -μ·B. The magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the Landé factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. For an electron, g is approximately 2 for the spin part. So H' = g μ_B B S_z. But wait, in the problem statement, B is 1 Tesla, which is a strong magnetic field, but for Hydrogen, the energy levels are split by the Zeeman effect in the presence of B.

Wait, but wait, also, the magnetic dipole interaction energy is H' = -μ·B. So more precisely, the energy is E' = -μ·B. For an electron, μ is given by μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2.

Wait, but the orbital contribution is another term. Wait, no, the orbital Zeeman effect is H_orbital = (e/(2m_e c)) * (L·B), but that's part of the fine structure. But in the case of paramagnetism, I think the dominant term is the spin part, especially for small m. Wait, but the question says m is small. So maybe m is the orbital quantum number l, but since m is the magnetic quantum number, m can be -l, ..., +l. But if m is small, like m=0, perhaps the orbital contribution is negligible? Or maybe the problem is referring to the spin quantum number, which is only ±1/2, but that's small.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating. Let's think of the paramagnetic contribution as the spin Zeeman term. So the energy shift for the spin part is E_spin = -μ_B g_s m_s B, where m_s is ±1/2. But wait, in the problem statement, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so m is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the orbital contribution. So the orbital magnetic dipole energy is E_orbital = (μ_0/(4π)) * (μ0/(4π)) * something? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the Zeeman effect. 

The orbital Zeeman energy is E_orbital = (e^2/(2 m_e c^2)) * B * m_l, where m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, but that's the form for the orbital contribution. The spin contribution is E_spin = -g_s μ_B m_s B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the total paramagnetic coupling would be the sum of both, but in hydrogen, the orbital contribution might be smaller because it's proportional to m_l, which is small, but the spin contribution is fixed for each state. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says "paramagnetic coupling term"—paramagnetism is usually due to the spin, not the orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin term. So for the spin part, the energy shift would be E_spin = g_s μ_B m_s B. Since m_s can be ±1/2, the maximum energy shift is ±(g_s μ_B B)/2.

But wait, for the problem, the paramagnetic term is the expectation value of H', which would be E_param = <H'> = g_s μ_B m_s B, where m_s is ±1/2.

Then, the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen is given as the energy difference corresponding to a photon with wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, I think. The Balmer-alpha line is at about 0.486 μm, so that corresponds to the transition between n=2 and n=3 in hydrogen? Or wait, wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so from n=3 to n=2, which is the 656 nm line (red). The 0.486 μm line is the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2, right? So ΔE is the energy difference between n=4 and n=2.

But wait, the exact value depends on the Rydberg constant. Let me compute ΔE. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV. But the energy levels are given by E_n = - R_H / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. So for the transition between n=2 and n=3 (Balmer-alpha?), or another transition. Wait, no, wait, the wavelength λ=0.4861e-6 meters is in the blue part of the spectrum, so that's the Balmer-beta line, which is the 4→2 transition.

So the energy difference ΔE is E_2 - E_4. Since E_n is negative, E_2 = -R_H/(2²) = -R_H/4, E_4 = -R_H/(4²) = -R_H/16. So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-R_H/4) - (-R_H/16) )= (-4 R_H + R_H)/16 = (-3 R_H)/16. Wait, but the energy is emitted when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, so ΔE is the absolute value of the difference. So |ΔE| = (3 R_H)/(16). 

Wait, R_H is about 13.6 eV, so 3/(16) *13.6 eV is approximately (0.1875)*13.6 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a rough calculation, but let me get the exact formula.

Alternatively, since the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where n2 > n1. For Balmer-beta, n1=2 and n2=4. So 1/λ = R_H (1/4 - 1/16) = R_H (3/16). So λ = 16/(3 R_H) in meters. Wait, but I need to compute the energy difference. The energy difference is given by ΔE = E2 - E4 = ( - R_H/(2²) ) - ( - R_H/(4²) ) )= (-R_H/4 ) + ( R_H/16 ) )= (-4 R_H + R_H)/16 )= (-3 R_H)/16. So the magnitude is 3 R_H /16 eV. Since R_H is about 13.6 eV, 3 *13.6 /16 ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic term. The paramagnetic coupling energy is E_param = g μ_B B m_s. Wait, let's think about the expectation value. For the spin part, the magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the Landé factor for spin, which is approximately 2 for an electron. m_s is ±1/2. So E_param = -μ·B = -μ_s B_z (since B is along Oz), so E_param = -g_s μ_B m_s B. The expectation value would be E_param = g_s μ_B m_s B, because energy is E = -μ·B. Wait no, wait, E = -μ·B. So if μ is in the same direction as B, the energy is negative. But I'm getting a bit confused here; perhaps I should just compute the magnitude.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So E_param = g_s μ_B m_s B. Let's plug in the numbers.

g_s ≈ 2, μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T, m_s = ±1/2, B=1 T.

So E_param ≈ 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * (1/2) * 1 T.

Simplify: The 2 and 1/2 cancel each other, so E_param ≈ 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait a second. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So converting 9.274e-24 J to eV: 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ approximately 5.8e-5 eV. So about 5.8 × 10^-5 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling energy is about 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

So comparing the two: 5.8e-5 eV (H') versus 2.55 eV (ΔE). So H' is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait—am I missing any factors? Because the question says the paramagnetic coupling term is compared with the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman shift, which is E_param ~ 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy is ~2.55 eV. So H' is much less than ΔE. So the expectation value of H' (paramagnetic coupling term) is much smaller than ΔE.

So the question is whether the paramagnetic term is much smaller or larger. So the options are:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → unlikely, as they're orders of magnitude apart.

B) ⟨H⟩≫ΔE → no, because 5.8e-5 is much smaller than 2.55.

C) ⟨H⟩≪ΔE → yes, because 5.8e-5 is much less than 2.55.

D) ⟨H⟩>ΔE → no.

So the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩≪ΔE.

Wait, but wait a minute—am I confusing the paramagnetic term with the fine structure splitting? Because the fine structure splitting is due to relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling, and is much smaller than the main energy levels. But in this question, the paramagnetic term would be the Zeeman effect, which could be significant. But in this case, since the magnetic field is 1 T, which isn't extremely strong, perhaps the paramagnetic shift is small compared to ΔE.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Let's compute E_param in eV again.

E_param = g μ_B m_s B.

g is about 2, μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T, m_s is 1/2, B=1 T.

So E_param = 2 * 9.274e-24 * (1/2) * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

Yes, that's about 5.8e-5 eV. So much smaller than the transition energy of ~2.55 eV.

So the paramagnetic term is much smaller, so option C is correct.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze both terms:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The transition energy corresponds to the energy difference between two hydrogen energy levels. Given the wavelength $\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}$, this corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition (n=4 → n=2). Using the Rydberg formula, the energy levels are $E_n = -R_H / n^2$, where $R_H \approx 13.6 \, \text{eV}$.  
   The energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = |E_2 - E_4| = \left| -\frac{R_H}{4} - \left(-\frac{R_H}{16} \right) \right| = \frac{3 R_H}{16}.
   \]  
   Substituting $R_H \approx 13.6 \, \text{eV}$:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{3 \cdot 13.6}{16} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\langle H \rangle$):**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field $\vec{B}$. For an electron, the magnetic moment is $\vec{\mu} = -g \mu_B \vec{S}$, where $g \approx 2$ is the Landé factor, $\mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\vec{S}$ is the spin operator. The energy shift is:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B} = g \mu_B m_s B,
   \]  
   where $m_s = \pm 1/2$ is the spin magnetic quantum number, and $B = 1 \, \text{T}$. Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx 2 \cdot 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The transition energy $\Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}$ is much larger than the paramagnetic coupling term $\langle H \rangle \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}$. Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Among the options:  
   - (A) $\langle H \rangle = \Delta E$: Incorrect, as they differ by orders of magnitude.  
   - (B) $\langle H \rangle \gg \Delta E$: Incorrect, as $\langle H \rangle$ is much smaller.  
   - (C) $\langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E$: Correct, as $\langle H \rangle$ is much smaller than $\Delta E$.  
   - (D) $\langle H \rangle > \Delta E$: Incorrect, as $\langle H \rangle$ is smaller.
