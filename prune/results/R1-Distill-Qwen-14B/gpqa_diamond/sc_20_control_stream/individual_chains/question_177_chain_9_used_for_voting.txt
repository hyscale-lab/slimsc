Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. But wait, the question isn't about mass directly, it's about luminosity. Oh right, because luminosity relates to how much light they emit.

The question says that the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same. Hmm, that's probably about black body radiation. Black bodies emit light peaking at a wavelength determined by their temperature. Oh, right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the wavelength at which the emission is a maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but I thought the luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. Luminosity L is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T and σ is a constant, the luminosity should depend on R squared.

So let's compute the ratio of their luminosities. L1 over L2 would be (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4). But since T1 = T2, that simplifies to (R1/R2)^2. R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. Squared that is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, but option B is ~2.32, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe there's a catch here.

Wait, no, the problem says that astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, the factor would be 2.25. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh right, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, how does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the apparent brightness. Radial velocity would affect the observed brightness due to Doppler shift, but the question says they computed the luminosity, which is an intrinsic property.

Wait, but could the velocities affect the observed wavelengths, which were used to determine the brightness? Oh, but the problem states that the brightest wavelengths are the same. So any Doppler shift must have been accounted for. Because if a star is moving towards or away, the observed wavelength would shift. But the question says that the brightest wavelengths are the same, so maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect that, or perhaps they've corrected for it.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects the luminosity calculation. But wait, no. Luminosity is the actual energy output, not the observed flux. So if Star_2 is moving, the flux we receive would change because of Doppler boosting. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity using black body radiation, so I think they would account for any Doppler effects when determining the actual luminosity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness. But when a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed flux changes. The flux is given by F = L / (4πd²), but if the star is moving towards us, the Doppler effect makes the observed wavelengths shorter, and could increase the flux. But in this case, the problem states that the stars were observed to have the same peak wavelengths. So perhaps the Doppler shift has been accounted for, which would mean that the actual temperatures are the same, which is what I assumed earlier.

Wait, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the peak wavelength? Let me think. The Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) when v_r is much smaller than the speed of light, but this is a rough approximation. Wait, no, the relativistic Doppler shift is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but this is for motion directly towards or away from the observer. Wait, but the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s for Star_2. But Star_1 has radial velocity zero, so it's stationary.

Wait, but how does this affect the peak wavelength? The problem says the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted. So without any other factors, Star_2 would have a shorter peak wavelength. But in the problem, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the actual temperatures are different, but the observed wavelengths are same because of Doppler shift.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to model this.

Assume that the actual (intrinsic) temperature of Star_1 is T1, and Star_2 is T2. But due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ), but since v_r is positive (moving away?) or negative (moving towards?), I need to clarify.

Wait, the radial velocity is given for Star_2 as 700 km/s. But the sign matters. If the radial velocity is positive, it could mean moving away (redshift), negative moving towards (blueshift). But the question doesn't specify the direction; it just says 700 km/s. Hmm, possibly, but perhaps it's moving away, so its observed wavelength would be longer. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So if Star_2 is moving away, its intrinsic peak wavelength would be shorter than Star_1's, which is stationary.

Alternatively, perhaps Star_2 is moving towards us, which would blueshift its emission, making the observed wavelength shorter than its rest frame. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same, so that would require Star_2's intrinsic peak wavelength to be longer than Star_1's.

Wait, okay, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think step by step.

Let me denote:

λ_obs,1 = λ_1 (since Star_1 is stationary, no Doppler shift)

λ_obs,2 = λ_2_observed = λ_2 * Doppler factor.

But the problem states λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. So λ_1 = λ_2_observed.

Now, the Doppler factor for Star_2 depends on its velocity. Let me calculate the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, if the star is moving towards us, v is negative (since v is the radial velocity away from us). So suppose Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. Then, the observed wavelength would be shorter than its rest wavelength.

But since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, we have:

λ_1 = λ_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, let me think about the signs. If Star_2 is moving towards us, v is negative. So the formula becomes:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - |v|/c) / (1 + |v|/c) )

Wait, maybe I should define the velocity as positive when moving away. So for Star_2, radial velocity is v = 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away, so positive v.

So for Star_2, the observed wavelength is λ_obs,2 = λ_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, and λ_obs,1 = λ_1,

So λ_1 = λ_2 * Doppler factor.

But λ_1 is for Star_1 (no Doppler shift), and λ_2 is the rest wavelength of Star_2.

So, λ_1 = λ_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But since λ = b / T (Wien's law), where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So λ is inversely proportional to T.

So, λ_1 = b / T1
λ_2 = b / T2

Substituting into the Doppler equation:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Rearranging:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, but the problem states that the stars' luminosities are to be compared, which depends on R and T.

Earlier, I thought T1 = T2, but that's only if they have the same observed peak wavelength without Doppler shift. But in this case, because Star_2 is moving, their actual temperatures might be different.

So that complicates things. Let me re-express this.

We have:

λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2

So (b / T1) = λ_obs,1

And (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 = b / T1

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Simplify, cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Hmm, that's interesting. So T2 is larger than T1, because the sqrt term is greater than 1 if v is positive (moving away). Because if Star_2 is moving away, then v is positive, so (1 + v/c) > (1 - v/c), so the ratio is greater than 1, so sqrt is greater than 1, so T2 is larger than T1.

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. But the problem states that both have the same observed wavelength, which is the same as Star_1's. So if Star_2 is moving away, its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when you redshift a shorter wavelength, you get the same observed wavelength as a longer one without redshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it numerically.

Suppose Star_1 has T1, so λ1 = b/T1.

Star_2, with T2, emits at λ2 = b/T2.

But due to Star_2 moving with radial velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) = λ1.

So:

λ2 = λ1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Then, λ2 = λ1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

But λ2 = b / T2, and λ1 = b / T1.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b:

1 / T2 = (1 / T1) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is what I had before.

So T2 is greater than T1, because the sqrt factor is greater than 1 if v is positive (i.e., moving away, v is positive).

Wait, but then how does that affect luminosity?

L = 4πR² σ T^4.

So, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4

So, L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1 / R2 = 1.5.

So R1^2 / R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T2 is greater than T1, as per earlier.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1/T2)^4

But T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 − v/c) )

So,

T1/T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 − v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 − v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = ( (1−v/c)/(1+v/c) )^2

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( (1−v/c)/(1+v/c) )^2

Now, we need to compute this factor, considering v is 700 km/s.

Wait, what's the speed of light in km/s? Approximately 3e5 km/s, because 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s.

So v = 700 km/s. So v/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

Very small compared to 1.

So we can approximate the (1 ± v/c) terms as roughly 1 ± (v/c).

But let's compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c):

(1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ let's compute that.

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ approximately 1.00467 (since 1.002333 * 1.00467 ≈ 1.007, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that (1+x)/(1-x) ≈ 1 + 2x for small x.

Wait, x = v/c = 0.002333.

So (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + 2x = 1 + 2*(0.002333) = 1.004666.

So sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ sqrt(1.004666) ≈ 1.00233.

But in any case, let's compute (1−v/c)/(1+v/c) = (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x.

So 1 - 2x = 1 - 2*(0.002333) = 1 - 0.004666 ≈ 0.995334.

So ( (1−v/c)/(1+v/c) )^2 ≈ (0.995334)^2.

What's 0.995334 squared? Let me compute that.

0.995334 * 0.995334 ≈ (1 - 0.004666)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004666) + (0.004666)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009332 + 0.0000217 ≈ approximately 0.990689.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990689 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229075.

Hmm, approximately 2.23.

But wait, let me do a more precise calculation. Let me compute (1−x)/(1+x) where x=0.002333...

(1−x) = 0.997667

(1+x) = 1.002333

(0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 0.997667 by 1.002333.

We can write this as (0.997667) / (1.002333) ≈ 0.995333 (since 1.002333 * 0.995333 ≈ 1.002333*(1 - 0.004667) ≈ 1.002333 - 0.004671 ≈ 0.997662. That's close to 0.997667, so yes, 0.995333 is a good approximation.

So ( (1−v/c)/(1+v/c) )² = (0.995333)^2 ≈ 0.99067.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, so the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).
   - Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_1 is stationary (\( v = 0 \)).

2. **Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:
   - Wien's Law states \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant and \( T \) is the temperature.
   - For Star_2, the observed wavelength is affected by its radial velocity due to the relativistic Doppler shift:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
   - Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), the intrinsic temperature of Star_2 (\( T_2 \)) is related to the temperature of Star_1 (\( T_1 \)) by:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - The ratio of the luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \), we get:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}\right)^4
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - The speed of light is \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so \( v/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \).
   - Compute \( \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.995334} \approx 0.997667
     \]
   - Raise this to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left(0.997667\right)^4 \approx 0.99067
     \]
   - Finally, compute \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99067 \approx 2.229
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2.
