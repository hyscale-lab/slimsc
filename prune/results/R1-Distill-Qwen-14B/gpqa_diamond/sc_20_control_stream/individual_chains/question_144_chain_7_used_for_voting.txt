Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me the production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, the lifetime is related to the width Γ via the uncertainty principle. 

Right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, the lifetime τ is roughly ħ divided by Γ. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. The natural linewidth is Γ, so the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, so Δt is ħ/(Γ). So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's ħ/(2Γ) or something else. Oh, well, perhaps I should just go with the approximation τ ≈ ħ/Γ for now.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying by the velocity v. So, mean distance L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity? Since the mass is given, I can calculate the velocity based on the energy, which is the production energy E_X. 

Wait, but E_X is the production energy, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, I think E_X here is the total energy of the meson. Because when they say production energy, perhaps it's the energy at which it's produced, so that's the total energy.

So, the total energy E is given by E = γ m c². The rest mass energy is m_X c² = 1.2 GeV. So gamma (γ) would be E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. 

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). So, from gamma, I can find v. Alternatively, I can use the relation between E, m, and v. Since E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So, the momentum p can be found from E and m.

Let me write that down:

E² = (p c)² + (m c²)²

So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 )

Then, p = sqrt( (E^2) - (m c^2)^2 ) / c

But I might need the velocity v. Alternatively, another approach: The velocity can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), so 1 - β² = 1/(γ²), so β² = 1 - 1/(γ²), so β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Given that γ is approximately 6.6667, so β = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).

Let me compute that. 6.6667 squared is about 44.444. So 1/44.444 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is about 0.9887 c.

But wait, maybe I can calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 6.6667^2: 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/(44.4444) is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, as I thought. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So the velocity is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ. Let me remember the values. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, let me check: Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 ×10^-34 J·s. But when working in units where c=1 and using GeV, we can express ħ in GeV·s. Let me compute that.

Since 1 GeV = 1.602 ×10^-10 J. So, ħ in GeV·s is approximately (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = approx 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

But wait, the width Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ to GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. Since v is about 0.9887 c, and c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So let me compute L:

L = v * τ = 0.9887 * c * τ.

Plugging in the numbers:

c = 3e8 m/s.

τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So:

0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ (2.966e8) * (2.056875e-24) ) m.

Multiplying 2.966e8 and 2.056875e-24:

2.966e8 = 2.966 * 10^8
2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 10^-24

Multiplying 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.117 (approx 6.117 )

Then 10^8 * 10^-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.117e-16 m.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So 6e-16 would be about 6e-16, but looking at the options, the closest is option D: 4.0655e-16 m, or option A:5.02e-16.

Hmm, maybe my approximation is off because I used beta as 0.9887, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me recalculate beta more accurately.

Gamma is E/mc² = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

So gamma equals 20/3.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444.

So 1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98872.

Wait, more accurately, 0.9775 is 0.9887^2? Let's compute (0.9887)^2.

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

First, 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

But wait, 0.9887 is 0.98 + 0.0087.

So,

(0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*(0.98)*(0.0087) = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.

(0.0087)^2 = 0.00007569.

Adding all together: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

So, 0.9887^2 ≈ 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So maybe the exact beta is a tiny bit less than 0.9887. Let's see, perhaps 0.9887 is a little more than necessary. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a better method.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approximation. Let me think, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it using delta. Let me let x = 0.9887, x^2 = 0.97752769.

But I need x such that x^2 = 0.9775. So perhaps x is approximately 0.9887 - delta.

Wait, let's assume x = 0.9887 - delta, then x^2 ≈ (0.9887)^2 - 2*0.9887 * delta.

We have x^2 = 0.9775.

So, 0.97752769 - 2*0.9887 * delta = 0.9775.

So, 0.97752769 - 0.9775 = 2 * 0.9887 * delta.

0.97752769 - 0.9775 = 0.00002769.

So, 0.00002769 = 2 * 0.9887 * delta.

delta ≈ 0.00002769 / (2 * 0.9887) ≈ 0.00002769 / 1.9774 ≈ approx 1.4e-5.

So x ≈ 0.9887 - 0.000014 ≈ 0.988686. So beta is approximately 0.988686, which is about 0.9887. So my initial approximation was good enough.

So, using 0.9887 is okay for the calculation.

Now, let's re-calculate L.

v = 0.9887 * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying these together:

2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Calculating the numbers:

2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ Let me compute that.

2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375.

2.056875 * 0.9661 ≈ Let's see:

2.056875 * 0.9 = 1.8511875.

2.056875 * 0.0661 ≈ approx 0.1363.

Adding up: 1.8511875 + 0.1363 ≈ 1.9875.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.9875 = 6.10125. So approximately 6.10125.

So 6.10125e-16 m. So L ≈ 6.10e-16 meters.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option A)5.0223e-16 m, and option C)5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, none of them are 6e-16. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Oh wait, wait. The mean decay length formula I used is L = v * ctau, where ctau is the lifetime multiplied by c. Wait, no, L = v * tau (lifetime), which is v multiplied by tau. But wait, tau is lifetime, which is in seconds, and velocity is in m/s. So the units would be meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute c * tau multiplied by beta.

Because, L = beta c tau. Oh wait, yes, because v = beta c, so L = beta c * tau.

So tau is in seconds, c is in m/s, beta is a dimensionless factor.

So L = beta c tau.

So let me recompute tau. Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / (Gamma).

So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, beta is approximately 0.9887.

So L = beta * c tau ≈ 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 m.

0.9887 * 6.170625 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.1689.

So approximately 5.9322 + 0.1689 ≈6.1011.

So L≈6.1011e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total energy being 8 GeV, but perhaps the energy is not the total energy. Because when a particle is produced, sometimes the energy is given as its center-of-mass energy or something else. Wait, no, in this case, production energy is given as E_X =8 GeV, which I think is the total energy. So E is 8 GeV, so I think that part was correct.

Wait another thought: the decay width Gamma is 320 MeV. So when calculating tau, I used Gamma in GeV. That part is correct.

Hmm, what if I made a mistake in the calculation of beta? Let me compute beta more accurately.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Wait, another approach: beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).

Because, for a relativistic particle, beta = sqrt(1 - (m²c^4)/(E²)).

But in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, E² = p² + m². So, beta = p/E.

But p can be expressed as sqrt(E² - m²) / c. Wait, no, in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(E² - m²).

So beta = p/E = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).

So, m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So (m/E)^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 =0.0225.

So sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887, as I had before.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator-like approach.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that 0.9887^2 ≈0.97752769, which is a bit above 0.9775, so perhaps the exact value is a bit less than 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps compute it more accurately.

Let me consider x = 0.988686 (from earlier approximation). Let's square it:

0.988686^2 = ?

0.988 * 0.988 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 0.988686 * 0.988686.

Let me compute:

0.988686 * 0.988686.

Break it down:

(0.98 + 0.008686)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.008686) + (0.008686)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.008686 = 2 * 0.00851228 ≈ 0.01702456.

(0.008686)^2 ≈ 0.00007543.

Adding all together: 0.9604 + 0.01702456 = 0.97742456 + 0.00007543 ≈ 0.97749999, which is very close to 0.9775. So x=0.988686 gives x^2≈0.9775, so beta is approximately 0.988686.

So using beta=0.988686, let's compute L = beta * c tau.

c tau = (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 0.988686 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Calculating 0.988686 *6.170625:

Let me first calculate 6.170625 * 0.988686.

6 * 0.988686 = 5.932116.

0.170625 *0.988686 ≈ let's compute that.

0.1 *0.988686=0.0988686.

0.07 *0.988686≈0.069208.

0.000625 *0.988686≈0.000618.

Adding these: 0.0988686 + 0.069208 = 0.1680766 + 0.000618≈0.1686946.

So total is 5.932116 + 0.1686946 ≈6.1008106.

So L≈6.1008e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m
D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm, none of the options match 6e-16 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime tau.

Wait, let's double-check tau. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

I used ħ ≈6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau= (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV )= 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps 6.582 divided by 0.32 is more accurately 20.56875.

Yes, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582.

Yes, so 6.582 / 0.32 =20.56875.

So yes, tau is 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me think: perhaps I can compute beta using another formula.

Another approach: The kinetic energy K = E - mc².

So, K =8 GeV -1.2 GeV =6.8 GeV.

But I don't think that's necessary because beta can be found from E and m.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between gamma and beta.

Gamma = E/(m c^2) =8/(1.2) =6.6667.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2).

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1 - beta^2.

So,

beta^2 =1 - (1/gamma^2) =1 - (1/(400/9)) ) = 1 - (9/400) )= (400-9)/400=391/400=0.9775. So beta= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So that part is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using relativistic equations differently.

Wait, perhaps the mean decay length is given by (c tau) * beta, which is the same as what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product beta * c tau.

Wait, let me recompute beta * c tau again.

Beta is approximately 0.9887.

c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

3e8 is 3*1e8=300,000,000.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 *1e-24.

Multiplying: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 *2.056875 * 1e8 *1e-24 =6.170625 * 1e-16 =6.170625e-16 m.

Then, multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.170625e-16 *0.9887 ≈6.1008e-16 m.

Hmm, again, this is about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: the decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, in particle physics, the width is often given in the natural units where ħ = c =1. So, when calculating tau, it's tau = ħ /Γ. But perhaps I should use the exact value with correct units.

Let me recompute tau using proper unit conversion.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

But when using the formula tau=ħ / Gamma, the units need to be consistent.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

Thus, tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV) = (6.582 /0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 =20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L = c tau * beta.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is c * tau * beta.

So, c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

beta=0.9887.

So, L =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

So compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 *0.9887 ≈6.1e-16 m.

No, same result.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute 6.170625e-16 *0.9887.

Breaking it down:

6.170625e-16 * 0.9 =5.5535625e-16.

6.170625e-16 *0.08=4.9365e-17.

6.170625e-16 *0.0087=5.37434e-18.

So adding up:

5.5535625e-16 =5.5535625e-16.

+ 0.049365e-15 (since 4.9365e-17 is 0.049365e-15) → 5.5535625e-16 + 0.49365e-16 =5.5535625e-16 +0.49365e-16 =6.0472125e-16.

+0.00537434e-15 (since 5.37434e-18 is 0.00537434e-15) →6.0472125e-16 +0.0537434e-16=6.1009559e-16 m.

So, around 6.101e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the width is given in GeV instead of MeV? No, the question says 320 MeV.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says the width Γ_X=320 MeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is the center-of-mass energy, and the decay products are at rest? No, that seems unlikely because it's a resonance, so it's produced with some energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the width is in the mass, not in the energy. Wait, no, the width is given as 320 MeV, which is energy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * tau) * beta.

But perhaps I should compute it in a different way. Wait, another approach: Compute the lifetime in seconds, then compute the velocity, then multiply.

Tau = ħ/(Gamma).

Gamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

So, tau =6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s.

Velocity v is beta c = (sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)) ) * c.

Which gives v=0.9887 *3e8 m/s =2.9661e8 m/s.

So, L = v * tau =2.9661e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

So L =2.9661e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 *2.056875) * 1e-16.

2.9661 *2.056875 = let's compute that.

2*2.056875=4.11375.

0.9661 *2.056875 ≈ let's compute 0.9 *2.056875=1.8511875.

0.0661 *2.056875≈0.1363.

Adding: 1.8511875 +0.1363≈1.9874875.

So total is 4.11375 +1.9874875≈6.1012375.

So L=6.1012375e-16 m ≈6.101e-16 meters.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the width is given as 320 MeV, but the formula for lifetime uses Γ/2 instead of Γ. Because sometimes the resonance width is defined as Γ=2*Gamma, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in particle physics, the natural linewidth is Γ, the total decay width, and the lifetime is tau=ħ/(Gamma). So that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution, where the width is Gamma. So I think my approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check my calculation of beta again. Because perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, let me compute beta again using exact numbers.

E =8 GeV.

m=1.2 GeV.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2)= sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for beta, like beta≈v/c= sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) ≈ 1 - (m^2)/(2 E^2).

Wait, maybe it's using a Taylor expansion for small m/E.

Let me try that approach. So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) ≈ 1 - (1/2)(m/E)^2.

Because when (m/E) is small, which it is here (m/E=0.15), the expansion would be a good approximation.

So,

beta ≈ 1 - (0.15)^2 / 2 = 1 - (0.0225)/2 =1 -0.01125=0.98875.

Which is very close to the actual beta of 0.9887. So, perhaps this approximation is used, leading to a slightly different calculation.

But that would give beta as ~0.98875, which would change the L by a tiny fraction, but not enough to make it match the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using more precise values of ħ. Because I approximated ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV·s, but maybe I should use more precise numbers.

The exact value of ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582×10^(-25) GeV·s. So perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

So, tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute this accurately.

6.582 divided by 0.32.

0.32 *20=6.4.

6.582 -6.4=0.182.

0.182 /0.32 =0.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.

No change here.

Hmm, perhaps the mean decay distance is calculated using gamma instead of beta?

Wait, no, that's not correct. The mean distance is v multiplied by tau, and v is beta c.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of the Planck constant. Let me double-check.

Planck constant h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

Reduced Planck constant ħ = h/(2pi) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Convert ħ to GeV·s.

1 GeV = 1.602176634e-10 J.

So,

1 J = 1/(1.602176634e-10) GeV ≈6.242e+9 GeV.

So, ħ in GeV·s is:

1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 GeV /1.602176634e-10 J) ) = 1.0545718e-34 * (1 /1.602176634e-10) GeV·s.

Compute that:

1.0545718e-34 /1.602176634e-10 = approx 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Yes, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula I should be using is L = gamma * c tau * beta.

Wait, no. L = v tau, which is beta c tau. Which I have already computed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity in terms of the momentum.

Wait, another approach: compute the momentum p.

p = gamma m v.

But E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So,

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

p c = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So, p =7.91 GeV /c.

Then, beta = (p c) / E =7.91 /8=0.98875.

Again, same as before.

So, beta is 0.98875.

So, L = beta * c tau =0.98875 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 *0.98875.

Compute 6.170625 *0.98875.

Let me compute 6.170625 * 0.98875.

Break it into 6.170625 * (1 -0.01125) ) =6.170625 - 6.170625 *0.01125.

6.170625 *0.01125 = approx 0.069348.

So, 6.170625 -0.069348 ≈6.101277.

So, L=6.101277e-16 meters.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, the options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of beta should use (m/E) = (1.2 GeV)/(8 GeV) =0.15.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values for the square root.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

We can use the Newton-Raphson method. Let me start with x=0.9887.

x0=0.9887.

f(x) =x^2 -0.9775.

f(0.9887)=0.97752769 -0.9775=0.00002769.

f'(x)=2x=2*0.9887=1.9774.

Next approximation: x1 =x0 -f(x0)/f'(x0) =0.9887 - (0.00002769/1.9774) ≈0.9887 - 1.4e-5 ≈0.98869.

Compute x1^2: (0.98869)^2.

Compute 0.98869 *0.98869.

Let me compute:

(0.98 + 0.00869)^2 =0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.00869 + (0.00869)^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.00869 =2 *0.0085182=0.0170364.

(0.00869)^2≈0.0000755.

Total: 0.9604+0.0170364=0.9774364 +0.0000755=0.9775119.

Which is 0.9775119. Which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So, f(x1)=0.9775119-0.9775=0.0000119.

Compute next iteration:

f(x1)=0.0000119.

f'(x1)=2x1=2*0.98869=1.97738.

x2 =x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1)= 0.98869 - (0.0000119 /1.97738) ≈0.98869 -5.98e-6 ≈0.988684.

Compute x2^2=(0.988684)^2.

Compute:

0.988684 *0.988684.

Let me compute 0.98 *0.98=0.9604.

0.98 *0.008684=0.00850.

0.008684 *0.98=0.00850.

0.008684^2≈0.0000754.

So,

(0.98 +0.008684)^2=0.98^2 +2*0.98*0.008684 + (0.008684)^2 =0.9604 + 0.0170832 +0.0000754=0.9604+0.0170832=0.9774832 +0.0000754=0.9775586.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 0.98 plus 0.008684 is 0.988684.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.988684 *0.988684 as:

(988684e-6)^2 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that beta is approximately 0.988684, and the square is 0.9775586, which is still a bit higher than 0.9775.

But perhaps after a few more iterations, it converges to a more precise value, but for practical purposes, it's approximately 0.98868.

So, beta is approximately 0.98868.

So, L=beta * c tau =0.98868 *6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 0.98868 *6.170625.

6 *0.98868≈5.93208.

0.170625 *0.98868≈0.16879.

Adding:5.93208 +0.16879≈6.10087.

So, L≈6.10087e-16 m.

Hmm, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using a different approximation for beta, like beta ≈1 - (m/(2E))^2.

Wait, using beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) ≈ 1 - (1/2)(m/E)^2.

Which would be 1 - (0.15)^2/2 =1 - 0.01125=0.98875.

So, with beta=0.98875.

Compute L=0.98875 *6.170625e-16 m.

0.98875 *6.170625=?

6 *0.98875=5.9325.

0.170625 *0.98875≈0.170625 *1=0.170625 minus 0.170625 *0.01125=0.0019203125.

So, 0.170625 -0.0019203125=0.1687046875.

So total is 5.9325 +0.1687046875≈6.1012046875.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses an approximate value for sqrt(0.9775), perhaps 0.9886 instead of 0.9887.

So, using beta=0.9886.

Compute L=0.9886 *6.170625e-16=?

0.9886 *6.170625.

6 *0.9886=5.9316.

0.170625 *0.9886≈0.1687.

Total≈5.9316 +0.1687=6.1003.

Still, same.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option A:5.0223e-16 m.

Option D:4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, 5.0223 is close to 5 times 1e-16, which is 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c tau.

Wait, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Then, beta is 0.9887, so L =6.170625e-16 *0.9887≈6.10e-16 m.

But none of the options are close to 6e-16.

Wait, perhaps the question meant the mass is 1200 MeV instead of 1.2 GeV? No, the question says 1.2 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the width is given as 320 GeV? No, the question says 320 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me check the value of ħ again.

Planck constant ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

1 J =1 kg·m²/s².

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So, 1 GeV =1e9 eV =1.60218e-10 J.

So, ħ in GeV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) ) = (1.0545718e-34 /1.60218e-10 ) GeV·s.

Compute that:

1.0545718e-34 /1.60218e-10 = (1.0545718 /1.60218 )e-24 ≈0.6582e-24=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, perhaps the decay length is calculated as (E/(m c^2)) * (ħ c)/(Gamma).

Wait, let me think.

Yes, sometimes decay lengths are given by L = (E/(m c^2)) * (ħ c)/(Gamma).

Wait, but let me double-check the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (gamma * ħ c )/(Gamma).

Because, gamma is E/(m c^2), and ħ c is a unit conversion factor.

Wait, gamma = E/(m c²) =8 GeV/(1.2 GeV) =6.6667.

So, gamma=20/3.

Then, L = gamma * (ħ c ) / (Gamma).

But what is the unit of ħ c?

In units where c=1, ħ c is ħ multiplied by c, but when using SI units, perhaps I should compute it.

Wait, let me compute ħ c.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, ħ c=6.582e-25 GeV·s *3e8 m/s =1.9746e-16 GeV·m.

But GeV is energy, so 1 GeV =1.602e-10 J.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express L in terms of units.

So, L= gamma * (ħ c ) / (Gamma).

Gamma is given in GeV.

So, gamma=6.6667.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

L = (6.6667) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s *3e8 m/s) / (0.32 GeV).

Compute numerator: 6.582e-25 *3e8 =1.9746e-16 GeV·m.

So,

L= (6.6667) * (1.9746e-16 GeV·m ) / (0.32 GeV) ).

The GeV cancels out.

So,

L=6.6667/0.32 *1.9746e-16 m.

6.6667/0.32=20.8333.

So,

20.8333 *1.9746e-16 =41.208e-16 m=4.1208e-15 m.

Which is 4.12e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is5.02e-15 m.

Hmm, but 4.12e-15 is closer to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 6.6667 /0.32.

6.6667 /0.32 =20.8334375.

So,

20.8334375 *1.9746e-16 = ?

Compute 20.8334375 *1.9746.

20 *1.9746=39.492.

0.8334375 *1.9746≈ approx 1.647.

Adding: 39.492 +1.647 ≈41.139.

So, 41.139e-16 m=4.1139e-15 m.

Which is about 4.11e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is close.

Hmm, but why did this approach give a different result than the earlier one? Because in this approach, I used L=gamma*(ħ c)/(Gamma).

Wait, perhaps this is the correct formula.

Let me think: The mean path length L is given by L = (gamma * c tau) * beta.

But wait, earlier I used L= beta c tau.

But perhaps in this approach, when calculating in terms of gamma, it's L=gamma * c tau * beta?

Wait, no, because tau is ħ/(Gamma), and beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (m/(gamma m))^2 )= sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)).

Wait, perhaps I should dig deeper.

Wait, tau= ħ/(Gamma)=6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV=2.056875e-24 s.

c tau =3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s=6.170625e-16 m.

Then, L=beta * c tau=0.9887 *6.170625e-16=6.10e-16 m.

But in the other approach, using gamma*(ħ c)/(Gamma), I get 4.1e-15 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used earlier is incorrect, and the correct formula is L=gamma * (ħ c)/(Gamma).

But why?

Let me think about the units.

Gamma has units of GeV.

ħ c has units of GeV·m.

Gamma is in GeV.

So, (ħ c)/Gamma has units of m.

Gamma is width, ħ c in GeV m.

So, (ħ c)/Gamma is in meters.

But multiplied by gamma, which is dimensionless, gives meters.

Hmm.

Wait, but in the previous approach, using beta * c tau, I got around 6e-16 m, but using this new approach, I get around4.1e-15 m.

Wait, but these are different by a factor of about 7.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by using the wrong relation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is L= (gamma * beta * c tau).

Which is the same as beta * c tau multiplied by gamma.

Wait, but no, because tau is already multiplied by c and beta.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time dilation.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.

But wait, proper lifetime is tau_0= ħ/(Gamma).

So, in the lab frame, tau=gamma * tau_0.

So, tau=gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Then, L= v tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which is beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Which is (beta gamma) (c ħ / Gamma).

But beta gamma is (gamma beta) = (gamma ) * (sqrt(1-1/gamma^2)).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this correctly.

Beta gamma is (gamma beta) = gamma * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) )=sqrt( gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2) )=sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ).

So, gamma^2= (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444.

gamma^2 -1=43.444.

sqrt(43.444)=6.59.

So, beta gamma=6.59.

Then, L= beta gamma * (c ħ / Gamma).

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

c ħ =3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s =1.9746e-16 GeV m.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So, (c ħ ) / Gamma =1.9746e-16 /0.32=6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma=6.59.

So, L=6.59 *6.170625e-16 m≈40.5e-16 m=4.05e-15 m.

Which is about 4.05e-15 m, which is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Ah! So that's where the option B comes from.

But wait, why did I get a different answer earlier?

Because in the previous approach, I used L=beta * c tau.

But tau is gamma tau_0.

So, tau=gamma tau_0.

So, L=beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is, L= (beta gamma) (c tau_0 ).

But tau_0 is ħ/(Gamma).

So,

L= (beta gamma) (c ħ / Gamma ).

Which gives:

beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )≈sqrt(44.444 -1)=sqrt(43.444)=6.59.

So, L=6.59 * (c ħ / Gamma ).

Which is what I just calculated.

So, why did the initial approach give a different result?

Because I didn't consider that tau=gamma tau_0.

Ah! So that's the mistake. In the initial approach, I used tau=tau_0, which is the proper lifetime, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So, I should have multiplied tau by gamma.

So, the correct decay length is L=beta * c tau_lab.

And tau_lab=gamma tau_0=gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

So,

L=beta * c * gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Which is:

L= (beta gamma) * (c ħ / Gamma).

Which is what I computed now.

So, using this approach, L≈4.05e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So, the correct answer is Option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \),
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \beta \)
The production energy \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) in natural units is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \gamma \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 \approx 44.444 \):

\[
\beta \gamma = \sqrt{44.444 - 1} = \sqrt{43.444} \approx 6.59
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.59 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \, \text{m}
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Then, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.59 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
