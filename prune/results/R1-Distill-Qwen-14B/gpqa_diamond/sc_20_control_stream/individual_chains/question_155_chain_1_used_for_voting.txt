Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, then apply this formula.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. So, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

And the operator P_z is given as a matrix with first row [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0, 0, 0], third row [0,0,-ħ]. So P_z is diagonal, which might make things easier.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state |ψ⟩ can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors. Let me think: the basis vectors for diagonal P_z would correspond to the eigenvectors. So each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z.

But wait, the state here is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So when I compute expectation values, I can just take the components squared multiplied by the eigenvalues.

Because in an eigenbasis, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalue for each eigenstate. So for P_z, each component in |ψ⟩ corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Let me see.

The matrix P_z is diagonal, so the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: for the first state, eigenvalue is ħ, second is 0 (since middle diagonal is 0), third is -ħ.

Wait, but looking at the matrix again: P_z is [[ħ,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-ħ]]. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, right?

So our state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. So when I express |ψ⟩ as a sum, the coefficients are the components of the vector. So |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = (-1/2) |1⟩ + (1/√2) |2⟩ + (-1/2) |3⟩,

where |1⟩ corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, |2⟩ to 0, |3⟩ to -ħ.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

So let's compute each term:

For |1⟩: coefficient is -1/2. |c|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. λ is ħ. So term is (1/4)*ħ.

For |2⟩: coefficient is 1/√2. |c|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. λ is 0. So term is 0.

For |3⟩: coefficient is -1/2. |c|^2 is 1/4. λ is -ħ. So term is (1/4)*(-ħ).

Adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

Now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, its square is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the eigenvalues for P_z squared would be (ħ)^2, 0^2=0, (-ħ)^2=ħ².

So the same approach: |c_i|^2 multiplied by (λ_i)^2, then sum.

Calculating each term:

|1⟩: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².

|2⟩: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

|3⟩: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².

Summing these: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

We have ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, so (⟨P_z⟩)^2 is 0.

So uncertainty ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps. Hmm, the coefficients when squared give their magnitudes. So the probabilities are correct. The eigenvalues for P_z are correct. So the expectation values are as I computed.

So the answer should be option B, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the coefficients of $|\psi\rangle$). From $|\psi\rangle$, the coefficients are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. Thus:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting into $\langle P_z \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, so its eigenvalues are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$: $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$, $\lambda_2^2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities $|c_i|^2$, we calculate:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle^2 = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
