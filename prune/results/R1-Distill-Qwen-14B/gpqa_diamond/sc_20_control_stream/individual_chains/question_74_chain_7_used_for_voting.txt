Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about the probability that a specific atom will decay within a certain time. 

Alright, the setup is that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. Now, they say that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. And we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, wait. So the next 150 minutes from when? Let me read again.

Wait, so the initial monitoring started, and 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? Or is it the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes? Because that makes a difference. Oh wait, the question says, "the next 150 minutes." So from the current time, which is 50 minutes after starting. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the initial given decay probability is for 100 minutes. So perhaps 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed, meaning 200 minutes in total? Or is it something else?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The 32% is the probability within 100 minutes. So the time frame was 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Oh, wait, but the next 150 minutes would be from the current time, which is 50 minutes into the monitoring. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So we need to find the probability of decay in 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of decay constants and exponential decay. Because radioactive decay follows an exponential model. So the probability of decay is independent of time, and depends only on the time elapsed.

The decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ can be found from that. The formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). Wait, no, actually, no. Let me get this right. The probability that a nucleus has decayed by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). So if P(100) is 32%, then 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So solving for λ.

Let me compute that. 1 - 0.32 is 0.68. So e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -λ *100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative because 0.68 is less than 1. So the negative would make λ positive, which makes sense. Let me calculate that. 

Calculating ln(0.68): I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e^-0.385) is about 0.45, but wait, let me think. Alternatively, using a calculator approach: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute. 

Wait, but maybe I should use exact numbers. Let me compute ln(0.68):

Using calculator: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.

So λ ≈ 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So we're to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but the next 150 minutes from the current time (after 50 minutes) would make the total time 200 minutes. So P(200) is the total probability up to 200 minutes. But since it hasn't decayed in the first 50, we're looking for the conditional probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes (starting from 50 minutes), regardless of what happened before. But in radioactive decay, the probability is independent of past events. So does that mean that the probability is the same as if we started fresh?

Wait, no. If the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, that gives us information. We have to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50. So it's a conditional probability.

The formula for conditional probability here would be P(decays in 50 to 200 | hasn't decayed in 0 to 50). That is, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50, given that it didn't decay in the first 50.

But in exponential decay, the probability of decay in a given interval is the same regardless of when you start. Because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute period, regardless of the time elapsed previously. So the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about this. Because the probability P(t) is the cumulative probability up to time t. So the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first t0 minutes, is equal to the probability that it decays in the interval (t0, t0+T). 

In the exponential distribution, the probability that an event occurs between t0 and t0 + T is P(t0+T) - P(t0). And since P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t}, this becomes [1 - e^{-λ (t0+T)}] - [1 - e^{-λ t0}] = e^{-λ t0} (1 - e^{-λ T}).

So the conditional probability is [P(t0 + T) - P(t0)] / [1 - P(t0)] because given that it hasn't decayed by t0, the probability is conditioned on that. 

Wait, no. The conditional probability is [P(t0 + T) - P(t0)] divided by the probability of not decaying by t0. Because the condition is that it hasn't decayed by t0. So the conditional probability is [P(t0+T) - P(t0)] / (1 - P(t0)).

Alternatively, I think whether the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any T-minute period, regardless of how much time has already passed. Because the exponential distribution has no memory. 

Wait, that's a key point. If the decay follows an exponential distribution, then the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same, regardless of how long it has been "waiting." So the 50 minutes that have passed don't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. So the probability would be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero.

But wait, in the problem, it's given that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the question is, what is the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay.

But due to the memoryless property, the chance for it to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as in any 150-minute interval. So it's not dependent on the previous 50 minutes.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The 32% is after 100 minutes. So let me first compute the decay constant, then calculate the probability for 150 minutes. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is from 50 to 200 minutes. So the probability would be P(200) - P(50). 

So let me compute that.

P(200) = 1 - e^{-λ * 200}

And P(50) = 1 - e^{-λ *50}

So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^{-200λ}] - [1 - e^{-50λ}] = e^{-50λ} (1 - e^{-150λ} )

But since the decay is memoryless, this is equivalent to P(150) because the probability of decay in any 150-minute period is the same. So regardless, the probability is 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, but according to the problem, the 32% is for 100 minutes. So perhaps the method is to first find λ, then compute the probability over 150 minutes.

So, let's proceed.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → 100λ = -ln(0.68) → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.4693) / 100 ≈ 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 min⁻¹.

Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute period.

P(150) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Calculating λ *150: 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

e^{-0.57849} is approximately e^(-0.578). Let me compute that.

I know that e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488. Let's compute 0.578.

Approximate e^(-0.578):

Using the Taylor series might be tedious, but perhaps it's easier to note that 0.578 is about 0.577, which is 1/√3 ≈ 0.57735. So e^(-1/√3) ≈ 0.5613.

Wait, but 1/√3 is about 0.57735, so 0.578 is almost that. So e^(-0.578) ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - e^{-0.578} ≈ 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So a 44% chance. 

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A) 44%.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Because sometimes the approximation can be off.

Let me compute e^(-0.57849) more accurately.

We can calculate e^x where x = -0.57849.

Using the calculator formula: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

But since x is negative, maybe it's easier to compute 1/(e^0.57849).

Compute e^0.57849:

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

e^0.57849 ≈ e^(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

e^0.07849: Let's compute 0.07849.

e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725, e^0.08 ≈ 1.0833.

0.07849 is between 0.07 and 0.08.

Approximating, e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 + (0.07849)^3/6.

0.07849^2 ≈ 0.006162, so 0.006162/2=0.003081.

0.07849^3 ≈ 0.000483, divided by 6 is 0.0000805.

So sum is approximately 1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849 + 0.003081 = 1.08157 + 0.0000805 ≈ 1.08165.

So e^0.07849 ≈ 1.08165.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165 ≈ Let's calculate:

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872; 1.64872 *0.08 = 0.1318976. Sum is 1.7806176.

But more accurately, 1.08165 is 1.08 + 0.00165.

So 1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

1.64872 * 0.00165 ≈ 0.002725.

So total is 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.002725 ≈ 1.78334.

So e^0.57849 ≈ approximately 1.7833.

So 1/1.7833 ≈ 0.5608.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5608.

Thus, 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is approximately 43.92%, so 44% when rounded to the nearest whole number.

So the probability is 44%, which is option A.

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential model. The probability of decay by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. Using the formula for \( P(t) \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.57849} \), we approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5608 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5608 \approx 0.4392 \, \text{or} \, 43.92\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the probability is approximately 44%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So we're to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but the next 150 minutes from the current time (after 50 minutes) would make the total time 200 minutes. So P(200) is the total probability up to 200 minutes.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes (starting from 50 minutes), regardless of what happened before. But in radioactive decay, the probability is independent of past events. So does that mean that the probability is the same as if we started fresh?

Wait, no. If the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, that gives us information. We have to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50. So it's a conditional probability.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about this. Because the probability P(t) is the cumulative probability up to time t. So the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first t0 minutes, is equal to the probability that it decays in the interval (t0, t0+T). 

In the exponential distribution, the probability that an event occurs between t0 and t0 + T is P(t0+T) - P(t0). And since P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t}, this becomes [1 - e^{-λ (t0+T)}] - [1 - e^{-λ t0}] = e^{-λ t0} (1 - e^{-λ T}).

So the conditional probability is [P(t0 + T) - P(t0)] / [1 - P(t0)] because given that it hasn't decayed by t0, the probability is conditioned on that. 

Wait, no. The conditional probability is [P(t0 + T) - P(t0)] divided by the probability of not decaying by t0. Because the condition is that it hasn't decayed by t0. So the conditional probability is [P(t0+T) - P(t0)] / (1 - P(t0)).

Alternatively, I think whether the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any T-minute period, regardless of how much time has already passed. Because the exponential distribution has no memory. 

Wait, that's a key point. If the decay follows an exponential distribution, then the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same, regardless of how long it has been "waiting."

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is from 50 to 200 minutes. So the probability would be P(200) - P(50). 

So let me compute that.

P(200) = 1 - e^{-λ * 200}

And P(50) = 1 - e^{-λ *50}

So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^{-200λ}] - [1 - e^{-50λ}] = e^{-50λ} (1 - e^{-150λ} )

But since the decay is memoryless, this is equivalent to P(150) because the probability of decay in any 150-minute period is the same. So regardless, the probability is 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, but according to the problem, the 32% is for 100 minutes. So perhaps the method is to first find λ, then compute the probability over 150 minutes.

So, let's proceed.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → 100λ = -ln(0.68) → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.4693) / 100 ≈ 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 min⁻¹.

Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute period.

P(150) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Calculating λ *150: 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

e^{-0.57849} is approximately e^(-0.578). Let me compute that.

I know that e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488. Let's compute 0.578.

Approximate e^(-0.578):

Using the Taylor series might be tedious, but perhaps it's easier to note that 0.578 is about 0.577, which is 1/√3 ≈ 0.57735. So e^(-1/√3) ≈ 0.5613.

Wait, but 1/√3 is about 0.57735, so 0.578 is almost that. So e^(-0.578) ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - e^{-0.578} ≈ 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So a 44% chance. 

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A) 44%.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Because sometimes the approximation can be off.

Let me compute e^(-0.57849) more accurately.

We can calculate e^x where x = -0.57849.

Using the calculator formula: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

But since x is negative, maybe it's easier to compute 1/(e^0.57849).

Compute e^0.57849:

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

e^0.57849 ≈ e^(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

e^0.07849: Let's compute 0.07849.

e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725, e^0.08 ≈ 1.0833.

0.07849 is between 0.07 and 0.08.

Approximating, e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 + (0.07849)^3/6.

0.07849^2 ≈ 0.006162, so 0.006162/2=0.003081.

0.07849^3 ≈ 0.000483, divided by 6 is 0.0000805.

So sum is approximately 1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849 + 0.003081 = 1.08157 + 0.0000805 ≈ 1.08165.

So e^0.07849 ≈ 1.08165.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165 ≈ Let's calculate:

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872; 1.64872 *0.08 = 0.1318976. Sum is 1.7806176.

But more accurately, 1.08165 is 1.08 + 0.00165.

So 1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

1.64872 * 0.00165 ≈ 0.002725.

So total is 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.002725 ≈ 1.78334.

So e^0.57849 ≈ approximately 1.7833.

So 1/1.7833 ≈ 0.5608.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5608.

Thus, 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is approximately 43.92%, so 44% when rounded to the nearest whole number.

So the probability is 44%, which is option A.

P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. Using the formula for \( P(t) \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.57849} \), we approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5608 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5608 \approx 0.4392 \, \text{or} \, 43.92\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the probability is approximately 44%. Therefore, the correct answer is:
