Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. Alright, the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities in a spherical detector. The setup involves Lorentz factors and the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls.

Hmm, the initial scenario says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so the main variables here are the Lorentz factor and the fraction of particles that reach the detector. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime.

So, the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame measures a longer lifetime, gamma * tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall is important because if the particle's lifetime is too short, it decays before reaching the wall.

Let me think about the problem step by step.

First, in the initial case, gamma is 20. One third of the particles reach the inner walls. Let's model the situation. If a particle is created at the center of the sphere, it has to travel a distance equal to the radius of the sphere to reach the wall. The radius is 30 meters.

The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is t = distance / velocity. But since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their velocity is very close to the speed of light. So, v ≈ c. Therefore, t ≈ R/(c).

Wait, but in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau. But from the lab's perspective, due to time dilation, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the particle will survive for gamma * tau in the lab frame.

So, the condition for a particle to reach the wall is that the time it takes to travel to the wall (t) must be less than the lifetime as observed in the lab (gamma * tau).

So, t = R/(v) ≈ R/(c), since v is approximately c.

So, if gamma * tau > R/c, then the particle will reach the wall. But wait, that's not quite right. Because the proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The particle must live longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

So, the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is determined by the exponential decay law. The probability that it hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall is the fraction that makes it.

The decay follows N(t) = N0 * exp(-t/(tau_lab)), where tau_lab is gamma * tau. So, the fraction that survive is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial case, gamma is 20, and one third survive. So, 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

But wait, t is R/(v). Again, v is approximately c, so t ≈ R/(c). Let's compute t for R=30 meters.

R = 30 m, c = 3e8 m/s, so t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. Hmm, that's 0.1 microseconds.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 30 meters divided by 3e8 m/s is 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 100 nanoseconds. Yeah, that's correct.

So, t = 1e-7 seconds.

So, for the initial case, 1/3 = exp( - (1e-7) / (20 tau) ).

Wait, but wait, the equation is the fraction that survive is exp( -t/(gamma tau) ), and that's equal to 1/3.

Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(1/3) = -t/(gamma tau).

So, ln(1/3) is equal to - (1e-7) / (20 tau).

Let me compute ln(1/3): that's about -1.0986.

So, -1.0986 = - (1e-7) / (20 tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = 1e-7 / (20 tau)

Wait, rearranging, 20 tau = 1e-7 / 1.0986

So, 20 tau = approx 9.1e-8 seconds.

Thus, tau = (9.1e-8) / 20 = 4.55e-9 seconds.

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime. So, tau ≈ 4.55e-9 s.

Now, the question asks what gamma is needed so that two-thirds of the particles reach the wall. That means the fraction surviving is 2/3.

So, 2/3 = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )

Take ln on both sides: ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma tau).

ln(2/3) is about -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = - (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

But from the initial condition, we found tau = 4.55e-9 s, as per gamma=20.

Wait, but wait. Since tau is a property of the particle, it's the same in both cases. So, in the second scenario, we can use the same tau but a different gamma.

So, from initial scenario:

gamma_initial * tau = 20 * tau.

In the second scenario, gamma_new * tau.

We set up the equation for the second scenario:

0.4055 = (1e-7) / (gamma_new * tau )

We can solve for gamma_new:

gamma_new = (1e-7 ) / (0.4055 * tau )

But from the initial condition, tau = (1e-7) / (20 *1.0986 )

Wait, let me recalculate tau. Earlier we had:

From initial case:

gamma_initial = 20,

fraction = 1/3 = exp( - t/(gamma_initial tau) )

So, ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau )

=> 20 tau = t / ( - ln(1/3) )

t is 1e-7 s.

ln(1/3) is -1.0986, so 20 tau = 1e-7 / 1.0986 ≈ 9.1e-8 s.

So tau = 9.1e-8 / 20 = 4.55e-9 s.

So, tau is 4.55e-9 s.

Now, in the second scenario, we have:

fraction = 2/3 = exp( - t/(gamma_new * tau) )

So, ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau )

=> gamma_new tau = t / ( - ln(2/3) )

We know ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, so:

gamma_new tau = t / 0.4055

t is 1e-7 s.

So, gamma_new = (1e-7) / (0.4055 * tau )

But tau is 4.55e-9 s.

Plugging in:

gamma_new = (1e-7) / (0.4055 * 4.55e-9 )

Compute denominator: 0.4055 * 4.55e-9 = ?

0.4055 * 4.55 = approx 1.843.

So, 0.4055 *4.55e-9 = 1.843e-9.

So denominator is 1.843e-9.

So, gamma_new = (1e-7) / (1.843e-9 ) = (1e-7 ) / (1.843e-9 ) = (1e2 ) / (1.843 ) ≈ 54.22.

Wait, 1e-7 divided by 1.843e-9 is 1e2 / 1.843 = approximately 54.22.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. So the required gamma is approximately 54.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute 0.4055 *4.55e-9.

0.4055 * 4.55 = let's compute it.

4 *0.4055 = 1.622, 0.55 *0.4055= 0.223. So total is around 1.845.

So, 0.4055 *4.55e-9 = 1.845e-9.

So, t is 1e-7 s, so 1e-7 / (1.845e-9 ) = (1e-7)/(1.845e-9 ) = (1e2)/(1.845) ) = approx 54.16.

So, gamma_new is approximately 54.2, which is option A (54).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the earlier steps. Let's go through the equations once more.

Another approach: Since the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), and the initial fraction was 1/3 with gamma=20, then for the new fraction 2/3, set up the ratio.

Let me denote gamma1 =20, f1=1/3; gamma2=gamma_new, f2=2/3.

We have:

f1 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)),

f2 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)).

Take the ratio f2/f1 = (exp(-t/(gamma2 tau )) ) / (exp(-t/(gamma1 tau )) )

Which is exp( t/(gamma1 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) )

But f2/f1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2.

So,

exp( t/(gamma1 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2.

Take natural log on both sides:

t/(gamma1 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) = ln 2.

Factor out t/(tau):

t/(tau) [1/(gamma1) - 1/(gamma2)] = ln 2.

But from the initial condition, we can find t/(tau) * (1/gamma1) = ln(1/f1).

Because f1 = exp( - t/(gamma1 tau) ), so ln f1 = - t/(gamma1 tau).

So, t/(gamma1 tau) = - ln f1 = ln(1/f1 ) = ln 3 ≈1.0986.

So,

t/(tau) [ (1/gamma1) - (1/gamma2) ] = ln 2.

But t/(gamma1 tau ) is ln 3.

So,

ln3 [ 1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ] = ln2.

Let me write this as:

[1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ] = ln2 / ln3.

Compute ln2 ≈0.6931, ln3≈1.0986.

So,

ln2/ln3 ≈ 0.6931/1.0986 ≈ 0.6309.

So,

1/gamma1 -1/gamma2 = 0.6309.

We know gamma1 is 20, so 1/20 =0.05.

So,

0.05 - 1/gamma2 = 0.6309.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.05 is less than 0.6309. That would imply 1/gamma2 is negative, which can't be.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, from earlier:

t/(gamma tau) = - ln f.

So, t/(gamma1 tau) = ln3.

So, ln3 [ 1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ] = ln 2.

So,

[1/20 - 1/gamma2 ] * ln3 = ln2.

Wait, maybe I messed up the algebra.

Wait, the equation is:

(1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ) * ln3 = ln2.

So,

1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 = (ln2)/(ln3).

Which is 0.6309.

So,

1/gamma2 = 1/gamma1 - (ln2)/(ln3).

But wait, 1/gamma1 is 0.05.

0.05 - 0.6309 would be negative, which would imply gamma2 is negative, which can't be.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me re-derive this.

We have:

ln(f2/f1) = [ t/(gamma1 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) ]

Which is [ (t/(tau)) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2) ]

So,

ln(f2/f1) = [ (t/(tau)) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2) ]

But from the initial condition, t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/f1) = ln3.

So, t/(tau) = gamma1 * ln3.

Substituting,

ln(f2/f1) = (gamma1 ln3) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 )

= ln3 ( 1/gamma1 ( gamma1 ln3 ) - 1/gamma2 (gamma1 ln3 ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I think the problem is that I set f2/f1 =2, but actually, f2 is 2/3 and f1 is 1/3, so f2/f1=2.

But when I set up the equation, perhaps I should have:

f2 = exp( - t/(gamma2 tau) )

f1 = exp( - t/(gamma1 tau) )

So,

f2/f1 = exp( t/(gamma1 tau ) - t/(gamma2 tau) )

Which is exp( t/(tau) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ) )

Which is exp( (gamma1 ln3 ) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2) )

Because t/(gamma1 tau) = ln3, so t/(tau) = gamma1 ln3.

So,

f2/f1 = exp( gamma1 ln3 (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2) )

Simplify inside the exponent:

gamma1 ln3 ( (gamma2 - gamma1) / (gamma1 gamma2) ) )

= ln3 * (gamma2 - gamma1 )/(gamma2 )

So,

ln(f2/f1 ) = ln3 * (gamma2 - gamma1 )/( gamma2 )

Because f2/f1=2, ln2 = ln3 * (gamma2 - gamma1 )/gamma2

Rearranged:

gamma2 ln2 = ln3 (gamma2 - gamma1 )

gamma2 ln2 = gamma2 ln3 - gamma1 ln3

gamma2 (ln3 - ln2 ) = gamma1 ln3

gamma2 = [ gamma1 ln3 ] / ( ln3 - ln2 )

Compute ln3 ≈1.0986, ln2≈0.6931.

ln3 - ln2 ≈0.4055.

So,

gamma2 = (20 *1.0986 ) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.2.

Which is about 54. So option A) 54 is the right answer.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the proper lifetime of the particles, and the time it takes for the particles to travel the radius of the detector.

### Key Information:
1. **Detector Radius**: \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \).
2. **Speed of Light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
3. **Initial Lorentz Factor**: \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), with one-third (\( \frac{1}{3} \)) of the particles reaching the wall.
4. **New Fraction**: Two-thirds (\( \frac{2}{3} \)) of the particles need to reach the wall, requiring a new Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \).

### Relativistic Decay and Survival Probability:
The survival probability of a particle reaching the wall is given by:
\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]
where:
- \( t = \frac{R}{c} \) is the time it takes for a particle to travel the radius of the detector.
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame.
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

From the initial condition (\( \gamma_1 = 20 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \)), we solve for \( \tau \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
\]
\[
\ln(3) = \frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma_1 \ln(3)}.
\]
The time \( t \) is:
\[
t = \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]
Substituting \( t \), \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), and \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \):
\[
\tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \times 1.0986} = 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
\]

### New Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma_2 \)):
For the new fraction \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \), the survival probability is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]
\[
-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]
Using \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \), we solve for \( \gamma_2 \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{t}{\tau \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}.
\]
Substituting \( t = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \), \( \tau = 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), and \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{4.55 \times 10^{-9} \times (-0.4055)}.
\]
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{-1.843 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 54.2.
\]

### Final Answer:
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \). Comparing with the options, the closest match is **A) 54**.
