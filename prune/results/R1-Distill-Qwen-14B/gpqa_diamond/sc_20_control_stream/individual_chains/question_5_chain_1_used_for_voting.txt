Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to parse it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components.

Wait, the problem gives me the matrices for each component. Let me jot them down. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which has [0, -i] in the first row and [i, 0] in the second. And P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, which is diagonal with 1 and -1.

So the operator P is probably the vector sum of P_x, P_y, and P_z in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction must be something like (x,0,z), right? So the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, perhaps.

Wait, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ must be zero or π, so n is in the x-z plane. So the direction of P is along the x-z plane. So the operator we're looking at is P = (P_x, 0, P_z), because the component along y is zero. Or wait, no, the operator is the vector operator, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Wait, no, wait. The operator along n would be the sum of the components scaled by the direction. So for a direction n = (a, 0, c) (since in x-z plane), the operator would be P = a P_x + c P_z. Because the y-component is zero, so the P_y term doesn't contribute.

Wait, but how is the operator constructed? Oh right, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product: P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But what are the components of n? Since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me denote n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since φ is zero (because in x-z plane), it's just sinθ.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. Let's say n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. So θ ranges from 0 to π/2 (if in x and z positive), but I think it can go up to π as well. But the exact value isn't given, so I have to find the eigenvector in terms of θ.

So the operator P is given by (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z. Because n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So let me write that out. Let me compute P as:

P = sinθ (ħ/2) σ_x + cosθ (ħ/2) σ_z.

Where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix and σ_z is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the matrix form of P would be:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that. The matrix would be:

First row: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1 ] = (ħ/2) cosθ, and (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 1 + 0 ] = (ħ/2) sinθ.

Wait, no. Let me compute each element:

The (1,1) element is (0 * sinθ + 1 * cosθ) * (ħ/2) → (cosθ)(ħ/2).

The (1,2) element is (1 * sinθ + 0 * cosθ) * (ħ/2) → (sinθ)(ħ/2).

Similarly, the (2,1) element is (1 * sinθ) * (ħ/2) → (sinθ)(ħ/2).

The (2,2) element is (0 * sinθ + (-1) * cosθ) * (ħ/2) → (-cosθ)(ħ/2).

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Hmm. Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the question states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, but quantum mechanical operators often have eigenvalues of ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. Wait, but here, since P is a component of angular momentum (like spin), perhaps the eigenvalue being ħ/2 suggests that it's aligned along the direction n.

Wait, but the operator P is the component of angular momentum along n. So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the case when the spin is aligned along n.

So the eigenvector we're looking for is the one where the system is in the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So to find the eigenvector, we solve (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) is:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-(ħ/2 cosθ)) - (ħ/2) ] ]

Simplify each element:

For (1,1): (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)

(1,2): (ħ/2) sinθ

(2,1): (ħ/2) sinθ

(2,2): (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 ) = -(ħ/2)(1 + cosθ )

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (cosθ -1) , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ , -(1 + cosθ) ] ] multiplied by ħ/2, but since we're working with the matrix equation, the scalar can be factored out. So the equation is:

( [ (cosθ -1) , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ , -(1 + cosθ) ] ) times [v1; v2] = 0.

So the two equations are:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 - (1 + cosθ) v2 = 0

I can write these as:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

Equation 2: sinθ v1 - (1 + cosθ) v2 = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for v2 from the first equation. Rearranging Equation 1:

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Similarly, from Equation 2:

sinθ v1 = (1 + cosθ) v2 → v2 = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ] v1

Wait, but [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] and [ sinθ/(1 + cosθ) ] should be the same, right?

Let me compute:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2)

Similarly, sinθ/(1 + cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos²(theta/2) ] ] = tan(theta/2 )

So yes, both expressions are equal. So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [v1, tan(theta/2) v1 ].

Let me factor v1 out: [1, tan(theta/2) ] multiplied by v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2) ].

But we need to normalize it. Let's compute the normalization condition:

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

v1 = 1, v2 = tan(theta/2 )

So |v1|^2 = 1, |v2|^2 = tan^2(theta/2 )

So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2) ) ) = 1/ sqrt( sec^2(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, because v2 = tan(theta/2) v1 → v2 = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) v1. So the vector is [ v1, v2 ] = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] multiplied by a normalization factor. Wait, wait: to get the normalized vector, let me see.

Wait, let's represent the vector as [1, tan(theta/2)].

The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = sqrt( 1 + tan^2(theta/2) ) ) = sec(theta/2 )

So to normalize, divide each component by sec(theta/2 ), which is 1/cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because [1, tan(theta/2)] / sec(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches exactly.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I derived the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is P for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So the eigenvectors are spin-up along direction n.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is represented as a column vector. So the first component is cos(theta/2), the second is sin(theta/2).

Yes, so the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that must be the correct answer.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as the sum of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, where:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (assuming $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis). Substituting these into $\vec{P}$, the matrix form of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation $(\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2}I)|v\rangle = 0$. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2}I$ from $\vec{P}$, the matrix becomes:

\[
\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2}I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector must satisfy the equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta v_1 - (1 + \cos\theta)v_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, $v_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_1 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1$. Substituting $v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1$ into the second equation confirms consistency. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, the magnitude of the eigenvector is:

\[
\sqrt{1^2 + \tan^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta/2)}.
\]

Dividing each component by $\frac{1}{\cos(\theta/2)}$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived components.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and additional terms.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to parse it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components.

Wait, the problem gives me the matrices for each component. Let me jot them down. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which has [0, -i] in the first row and [i, 0] in the second. And P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, which is diagonal with 1 and -1.

So the operator P is probably the vector sum of P_x, P_y, and P_z in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction must be something like (x,0,z), right? So the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, perhaps.

Wait, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ must be zero or π, so n is in the x-z plane. So the direction of P is along the x-z plane. So the operator we're looking at is P = (P_x, 0, P_z), because the component along y is zero. Or wait, no, the operator is the vector operator, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Wait, no, wait. The operator along n would be the sum of the components scaled by the direction. So for a direction n = (a, 0, c) (since in x-z plane), the operator would be P = a P_x + c P_z. Because the y-component is zero, so the P_y term doesn't contribute.

Wait, but how is the operator constructed? Oh right, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product: P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But what are the components of n? Since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me denote n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since φ is zero (because in x-z plane), it's just sinθ.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. Let's say n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. So θ ranges from 0 to π/2 (if in x and z positive), but I think it can go up to π as well. But the exact value isn't given, so I have to find the eigenvector in terms of θ.

So the operator P is given by (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z. Because n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So let me write that out. Let me compute P as:

P = sinθ (ħ/2) σ_x + cosθ (ħ/2) σ_z.

Where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix and σ_z is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the matrix form of P would be:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that. The matrix would be:

First row: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1 ] = (ħ/2) cosθ, and (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 1 + 0 ] = (ħ/2) sinθ.

Wait, no. Let me compute each element:

The (1,1) element is (0 * sinθ + 1 * cosθ) * (ħ/2) → (cosθ)(ħ/2).

The (1,2) element is (1 * sinθ + 0 * cosθ) * (ħ/2) → (sinθ)(ħ/2).

Similarly, the (2,1) element is (1 * sinθ) * (ħ/2) → (sinθ)(ħ/2).

The (2,2) element is (0 * sinθ + (-1) * cosθ) * (ħ/2) → (-cosθ)(ħ/2).

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Hmm. Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the question states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, but quantum mechanical operators often have eigenvalues of ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. Wait, but here, since P is a component of angular momentum (like spin), perhaps the eigenvalue being ħ/2 suggests that it's aligned along the direction n.

Wait, but the operator P is the component of angular momentum along n. So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the case when the spin is aligned along n.

So the eigenvector we're looking for is the one where the system is in the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So to find the eigenvector, we solve (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) is:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-(ħ/2 cosθ)) - (ħ/2) ] ]

Simplify each element:

For (1,1): (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)

(1,2): (ħ/2) sinθ

(2,1): (ħ/2) sinθ

(2,2): (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 ) = -(ħ/2)(1 + cosθ )

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (cosθ -1) , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ , -(1 + cosθ) ] ] multiplied by ħ/2, but since we're working with the matrix equation, the scalar can be factored out. So the equation is:

( [ (cosθ -1) , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ , -(1 + cosθ) ] ) times [v1; v2] = 0.

So the two equations are:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 - (1 + cosθ) v2 = 0

I can write these as:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

Equation 2: sinθ v1 - (1 + cosθ) v2 = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for v2 from the first equation. Rearranging Equation 1:

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Similarly, from Equation 2:

sinθ v1 = (1 + cosθ) v2 → v2 = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ] v1

Wait, but [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] and [ sinθ/(1 + cosθ) ] should be the same, right?

Let me compute:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2)

Similarly, sinθ/(1 + cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos²(theta/2) ] ] = tan(theta/2 )

So yes, both expressions are equal. So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [v1, tan(theta/2) v1 ].

Let me factor v1 out: [1, tan(theta/2) ] multiplied by v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2) ].

But we need to normalize it. Let's compute the normalization condition:

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

v1 = 1, v2 = tan(theta/2 )

So |v1|^2 = 1, |v2|^2 = tan^2(theta/2 )

So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2) ) ) = 1/ sqrt( sec^2(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, because v2 = tan(theta/2) v1 → v2 = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) v1. So the vector is [ v1, v2 ] = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] multiplied by a normalization factor. Wait, wait: to get the normalized vector, let me see.

Wait, let's represent the vector as [1, tan(theta/2)].

The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = sqrt( 1 + tan^2(theta/2) ) ) = sec(theta/2 )

So to normalize, divide each component by sec(theta/2 ), which is 1/cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because [1, tan(theta/2)] / sec(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches exactly.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I derived the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is P for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So the eigenvectors are spin-up along direction n.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is represented as a column vector. So the first component is cos(theta/2), the second is sin(theta/2).

Yes, so the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that must be the correct answer.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as the sum of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, where:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (assuming $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis). Substituting these into $\vec{P}$, the matrix form of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation $(\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2}I)|v\rangle = 0$. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2}I$ from $\vec{P}$, the matrix becomes:

\[
\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2}I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector must satisfy the equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta v_1 - (1 + \cos\theta)v_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, $v_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_1 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1$. Substituting $v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1$ into the second equation confirms consistency. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, the magnitude of the eigenvector is:

\[
\sqrt{1^2 + \tan^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta/2)}.
\]

Dividing each component by $\frac{1}{\cos(\theta/2)}$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived components.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and additional terms.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
