Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. It involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Hmm, I remember that dithiocyanato complexes are those where the cobalt is bound by two thiocyanate ions.

The problem gives me some stability constants, which I think are the formation constants for the complexes. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, right? So the higher the β, the more stable the complex with that many ligands. But the β4 is lower than β3 here, so that's a bit confusing. Maybe β4 is for a different structure or maybe I'm misremembering.

The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. I need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the Co(SCN)_2^+ complexes. Wait, no, wait, dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ ? Or maybe it's a neutral complex? Not sure, but the key point is that the blue ones are the dithiocyanato.

I think the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up, then find the percentage for the desired complex.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants (formation constants) to determine the distribution of species in solution. The species present would be Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, assuming four possible complexes.

Wait, but the stability constants given are for each step. Wait, no, the stability constants are for each complex. So the β for n ligands is the formation constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(something). Wait, but I think each β is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for example, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the four possible complexes are:

Co^2+ (free ion)
[CoSCN]^+ (monooxonuclear, one SCN)
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 (dithiocyanato)
[Co(SCN)_3]^-
[Co(SCN)_4]^2-

Wait, but the problem only gives four β's, so maybe the solution doesn't go beyond four ligands. Hmm, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So to find the percentage of this species, I need to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to all Co species.

But how do I compute that? I think I can use the method of successive approximations or the formation of complexes step by step.

Alternatively, I can model each complex's concentration using the formation constants and the given concentrations.

I remember that the fractions can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_k [Co^2+][SCN^-]^k) for k=0 to 4)

Wait, but wait, [Co^2+] is not just free Co^2+, because the complexes also contribute. Oh, right, the total concentration of cobalt is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of [Co^2+] and all the complex species must equal 0.01 M.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the distribution of the species using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me write down the possible complexes and their formation constants:

n = 0: Co^2+ → β0 = 1 (since it's the free ion)
n = 1: [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = 9
n = 2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2 = 40
n = 3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3 = 63
n = 4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → β4 = 16

Wait, but wait, the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3, which is 63. That's a bit odd because higher n usually have higher β, but maybe in this case, the fourth complex isn't as stable. Hmm, but that's okay, I'll proceed with the given values.

The concentrations of each complex depend on the stability constants and the concentrations of the reactants.

The concentration of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] can be written in terms of the free [Co^2+] and [SCN^-], using the formation constant:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But since the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all Co species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n]

So,

c_total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Let me factor out [Co^2+]:

c_total = [Co^2+] [1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ]

We can solve for [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] = c_total / [1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ]

Once [Co^2+] is known, each complex's concentration can be found.

But wait, the given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Let me compute each term in the denominator:

Compute each term:

β0 term is 1.

β1 term: β1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 term: β2 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4.

β3 term: β3 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

β4 term: β4 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 → 2.3646

So the denominator is 2.3646.

c_total is 0.01 M.

So [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, let me calculate that:

0.01 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.004225.

Now, compute each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] =9 * 0.004225 *0.1 = 9 * 0.004225 *0.1 → 9 * 0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 =40 *0.004225*(0.1)^2 →40 *0.004225 *0.01 =40 *0.00004225=0.00169 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 =63 *0.004225*(0.1)^3 →63 *0.004225 *0.001 =63 *0.000004225= approx 0.000266275 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4=16 *0.004225*(0.1)^4 → 16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 *0.0000004225= 0.00000676 M.

Wait, but wait, what about the free Co^2+? It was 0.004225 M.

So summing all the concentrations:

Co^2+: 0.004225

CoSCN^+: 0.0038025

Co(SCN)_2^0: 0.00169

Co(SCN)_3^-: 0.000266275

Co(SCN)_4^{2-}: 0.00000676

Let me sum these to check if they add up to 0.01 M.

0.004225 + 0.0038025 = 0.0080275

+0.00169 → 0.0097175

+0.000266275 →0.009983775

+0.00000676 →0.009990535.

Wait, that's about 0.00999 M, which is very close to 0.01 M. The discrepancy is due to rounding errors in my calculations.

So the fractions of each species are their concentrations divided by 0.01.

So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, concentration is 0.00169 M.

Fraction f = (0.00169) / 0.01 = 0.169 → 16.9%?

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So that would be 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So 16.9% is option D.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the denominator was 2.3646, so [Co^2+] is 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225.

Then [Co(SCN)_2]^0= β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2.

Let me compute that again.

0.004225 * (0.1)^2 = 0.004225 * 0.01 = 0.00004225.

Multiply by 40: 0.00004225 *40=0.00169. So yes, 0.00169 M.

Divided by 0.01, that's 0.169, or 16.9%.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16), the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

### Step 1: Total cobalt species
The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the following species:
- Free Co²⁺
- [CoSCN]⁺
- [Co(SCN)_2]⁰
- [Co(SCN)_3]⁻
- [Co(SCN)_4]²⁻

The formation constants relate the concentration of each complex to the free cobalt ion and thiocyanate ion:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]
The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

### Step 2: Solve for [Co²⁺]
Factoring out \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\), we get:
\[
c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 1 + 9(0.1) = 1.9
\]
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40(0.1)^2 = 40(0.01) = 0.4
\]
\[
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63(0.1)^3 = 63(0.001) = 0.063
\]
\[
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16(0.1)^4 = 16(0.0001) = 0.0016
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]
Thus:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{2.3646} = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰
The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)_2]⁰ is:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.01 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰
The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰ relative to all cobalt species is:
\[
f = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} = 0.169
\]
Converting to percentage:
\[
f \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
