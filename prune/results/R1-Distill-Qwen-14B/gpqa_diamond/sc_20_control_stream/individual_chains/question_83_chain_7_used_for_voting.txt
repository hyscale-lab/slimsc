Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says we take 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think about what happens when you dilute a solution. Diluting with equal volumes, so the concentration should change. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and after adding the same volume of water, the new concentration should be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is fixed. So 0.05 M divided by 2 gives 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate it properly. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, making it 40 cm³ total. The moles of acetic acid stay the same. The initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

But first, let's figure out the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to calculate how much NaOH is used at that point.

Wait, let's find the equivalence point first. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% of that would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, so the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. 

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This setup is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The Ka given is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.743 (since 1e-5 is 5, but 1.85 is 10^0.267, so 5 -0.267=4.733? Wait, wait. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 -0.477 ≈ 4.253. That's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and D is 4.57. So the first value is around 4.26, so perhaps option A or D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when I do ratios, I might make a mistake.

So moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.00075, acetate 0.00025. The ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) = -0.477. So pKa is 4.73, so pH = 4.73 -0.477 = 4.253, which rounds to 4.25. So option A is 4.26, which is close.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted to form acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So for 0.001 moles of acetic acid, 0.001 moles of NaOH are added. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ (x^2)/0.02, since x is very small. So x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17;6.73
C)4.73;7.00
D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of the options for equivalence point is around 9.02. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) =5.405e-10. So x²=5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11. x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, so pOH is 4.98, pH=9.02. So equivalence point pH is about 9.02, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Or maybe I messed up the volume calculation.

Wait, after equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added would be in excess if it's beyond equivalence, but at equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution is sodium acetate. So the calculation should hold.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate? Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles. At equivalence, those 0.001 moles are converted to acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³. 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis equation more accurately, without the approximation.

So Kb = 5.405e-10, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

The equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02, so x² =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. x=1.04e-5. That gives [OH-]≈1.04e-5.

pOH=-log(1.04e-5)= about 4.98, pH=9.02.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the equivalence point is wrong? Let me double-check.

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol. Then diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol. So volume is 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³. That's correct.

So the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³, added to 40 cm³, making 50 cm³.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is not in a 50 cm³ volume. Wait, no, when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of solution, yes, it becomes 50 cm³.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the Kb or the Ka.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for the equivalence point pH of a weak acid titrated with strong base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

The formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because for a weak acid HA, the equivalence point is when you have A^- in solution. The pH is given by the hydrolysis of A^-.

Wait, pKw is 14, so pH = ½ (4.73 +14) = ½ (18.73) =9.365. So about 9.36. Hmm, that's even higher than the 9.02 I calculated earlier. But neither matches the options.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately without approximation.

The Kb expression: Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So the same as before.

But perhaps the x isn't that small? Let me compute without the approximation.

x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x -0.02 Kb =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4*0.02*Kb)}]/2

But Kb is 5.405e-10, very small, so the sqrt term is sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*0.02 *5.405e-10 )

Which is sqrt( (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Wait, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's second value of 8.52. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but why the difference? Because when I assumed x was negligible, I got [OH-]=1.04e-5, pH=9.02, but with more accurate calculation, the [OH-] is about 3.29e-6, so pOH is 5.48, pH=8.52. So the correct pH at equivalence point is about 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the pH at equivalence should be around 9, but that's when I used the approximation. So perhaps the correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation.

So, why did I get two different results based on the same Kb?

Ah, because in the first approach, I neglected x in the denominator, which may not be accurate if Kb is not very small. But in this case, Kb is 5.4e-10, which is very small, so x would be tiny compared to 0.02. So why the quadratic method gave a higher x?

Wait, let me compute the numbers again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Alternative approach: Let's compute it more accurately.

Set up the equation: x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02 *5.405e-10) → c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/2.

Since x must be positive, take the positive root:

x=(6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=-log(3.288e-6)=5.486. So pH=14-5.486=8.514. So approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.51.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I thought the pH was around 9, but the quadratic calculation brings it down to around 8.5. So perhaps the correct equivalence pH is around 8.5.

But why did the initial approach using pKa + pKw/2 give 9.36, which is higher than this? Because that's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps that approach is incorrect. Let me think. The pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

So the correct method is to calculate it with Kb, either via approximation or quadratic.

So, in this case, with Kb=5.405e-10 and concentration 0.02 M, the accurate value using quadratic gives pH ≈8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

So, putting it together:

At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26.

At equivalence point, pH is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, I thought the initial calculation at 25% gave pH 4.25, which is close to 4.26. So option A is the choice.

Wait, but earlier I thought the equivalence point would be around 9, but it's actually around 8.5. So that's why I must have made a mistake earlier.

So the correct answer should be option A: 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, that's a different set. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the 25% titration part. Let me re-examine that.

At 25% titration, we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 M. Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M= 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, after reaction, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.00075 mol, and acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³= 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647) = pKa + log(1/3) ≈4.73 + (-0.477)=4.253.

So about 4.25, which is closest to 4.26 in option A.

Then equivalence point pH is 8.51, which is option A's second value.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Initial moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since NaOH is a strong base, it reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\).

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, \([OH^-] \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), and:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\).

Finally, comparing the calculated values (\(4.26\) at 25% titration and \(8.52\) at the equivalence point) with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says we take 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think about what happens when you dilute a solution. Diluting with equal volumes, so the concentration should change. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and after adding the same volume of water, the new concentration should be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is fixed. So 0.05 M divided by 2 gives 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate it properly. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, making it 40 cm³ total. The moles of acetic acid stay the same. The initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

But first, let's figure out the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to calculate how much NaOH is used at that point.

Wait, let's find the equivalence point first. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% of that would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, so the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. 

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This setup is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The Ka given is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.743 (since 1e-5 is 5, but 1.85 is 10^0.267, so 5 -0.267=4.733? Wait, wait. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 -0.477 ≈ 4.253. That's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and D is 4.57. So the first value is around 4.26, so perhaps option A or D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when I do ratios, I might make a mistake.

So moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.00075, acetate 0.00025. The ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) = -0.477. So pKa is 4.73, so pH = 4.73 -0.477 = 4.253, which rounds to 4.25. So option A is 4.26, which is close.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted to form acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So for 0.001 moles of acetic acid, 0.001 moles of NaOH are added. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ (x^2)/0.02, since x is very small. So x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17;6.73
C)4.73;7.00
D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of the options for equivalence point is around 9.02. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) =5.405e-10. So x²=5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11. x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, so pOH is 4.98, pH=9.02. So equivalence point pH is about 9.02, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Or maybe I messed up the volume calculation.

Wait, after equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added would be in excess if it's beyond equivalence, but at equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution is sodium acetate. So the calculation should hold.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate? Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles. At equivalence, those 0.001 moles are converted to acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³. 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis equation more accurately, without the approximation.

So Kb = 5.405e-10, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

The equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02, so x² =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. x=1.04e-5. That gives [OH-]≈1.04e-5.

pOH=-log(1.04e-5)= about 4.98, pH=9.02.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the equivalence point is wrong? Let me double-check.

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol. Then diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol. So volume is 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³. That's correct.

So the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³, added to 40 cm³, making 50 cm³.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is not in a 50 cm³ volume. Wait, no, when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of solution, yes, it becomes 50 cm³.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the Kb or the Ka.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for the equivalence point pH of a weak acid titrated with strong base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

The formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because for a weak acid HA, the equivalence point is when you have A^- in solution. The pH is given by the hydrolysis of A^-.

Wait, pKw is 14, so pH = ½ (4.73 +14) = ½ (18.73) =9.365. So about 9.36. Hmm, that's even higher than the 9.02 I calculated earlier. But neither matches the options.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately without approximation.

The Kb expression: Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So the same as before.

But perhaps the x isn't that small? Let me compute without the approximation.

x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x -0.02 Kb =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4*0.02*Kb)}]/2

But Kb is 5.405e-10, very small, so the sqrt term is sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*0.02 *5.405e-10 )

Which is sqrt( (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Wait, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's second value of 8.52. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but why the difference? Because when I assumed x was negligible, I got [OH-]=1.04e-5, pH=9.02, but with more accurate calculation, the [OH-] is about 3.29e-6, so pOH is 5.48, pH=8.52. So the correct pH at equivalence point is about 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the pH at equivalence should be around 9, but that's when I used the approximation. So perhaps the correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation.

So, why did I get two different results based on the same Kb?

Ah, because in the first approach, I neglected x in the denominator, which may not be accurate if Kb is not very small. But in this case, Kb is 5.4e-10, which is very small, so x would be tiny compared to 0.02. So why the quadratic method gave a higher x?

Wait, let me compute the numbers again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Alternative approach: Let's compute it more accurately.

Set up the equation: x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02 *5.405e-10) → c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/2.

Since x must be positive, take the positive root:

x=(6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=-log(3.288e-6)=5.486. So pH=14-5.486=8.514. So approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.51.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I thought the pH was around 9, but the quadratic calculation brings it down to around 8.5. So perhaps the correct equivalence pH is around 8.5.

But why did the initial approach using pKa + pKw/2 give 9.36, which is higher than this? Because that's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps that approach is incorrect. Let me think. The pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

So the correct method is to calculate it with Kb, either via approximation or quadratic.

So, in this case, with Kb=5.405e-10 and concentration 0.02 M, the accurate value using quadratic gives pH ≈8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

So, putting it together:

At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26.

At equivalence point, pH is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, I thought the initial calculation at 25% gave pH 4.25, which is close to 4.26. So option A is the choice.

Wait, but earlier I thought the equivalence point would be around 9, but it's actually around 8.5. So that's why I must have made a mistake earlier.

So the correct answer should be option A: 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, that's a different set. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the 25% titration part. Let me re-examine that.

At 25% titration, we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 M. Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M= 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, after reaction, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.00075 mol, and acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³= 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647) = pKa + log(1/3) ≈4.73 + (-0.477)=4.253.

So about 4.25, which is closest to 4.26 in option A.

Then equivalence point pH is 8.51, which is option A's second value.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Initial moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since NaOH is a strong base, it reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\).

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, \([OH^-] \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), and:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\).

Finally, comparing the calculated values (\(4.26\) at 25% titration and \(8.52\) at the equivalence point) with the options, the correct answer is:
