Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

So, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound which makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene's sequence, especially in the first exon area, where some changes happened.

The question is asking which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or changing the protein structure so it doesn't produce the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different mutation in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations there can affect the protein product. Missense mutations change an amino acid, while nonsense mutations create a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.

Let's look at each mutant's change. The intact gene is given first, so I can compare each mutant to that.

The wild type (intact) sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
So, looking at the beginning:

Positions 1-15: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT

Now, let me compare each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the change is at the fifth or sixth position. Let me look. The wild type has TTTCTCGC. Wait, let's see:

Wild type exon 1 starts: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, breaking it down:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Hmm. So, the first part is ATG, then in wild it's TTT CTC, and in mutant 1 it's TCT TAC. Wait, so that's a substitution. Let me count the nucleotides. Let's see:

Wild: positions 4-8: TTTCT (so letters 4-8 are T, T, T, C, T)
Mutant 1: positions 4-8: TCTAC (T, C, T, A, C). Wait, that's a substitution of the TTTCT into TCTAC? Or maybe I miscounted.

Wait, maybe it's better to compare each position:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, perhaps in wild, the next few are TTTCT, and in mutant1, it's TCTAC. So what's the change? Let's line them up:

Wild: positions 1-20: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 etc.

Wait, perhaps I can write the wild and mutant sequences for the affected area.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So, the change is in the fifth and sixth nucleotides. Wait, the first part is ATGTTTCT... in wild, and ATGTTCT... in mutant 1.

Wait, the exact change: in wild, the next after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, I think the first four nucleotides are the same: ATG T. Then in wild, it's TTTCT, and in mutant1, it's TCTAC.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact nucleotide changes.

Let me write the wild and mutant sequences for the first 20 nucleotides.

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Looking at the first part:

Wild: positions 4-8: T T T C T

Mutant1: positions 4-8: T C T A C

So, the changes are: the third T becomes a C, the C becomes a T, and the T becomes an A? Or perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, perhaps better to number each position.

Wild: 1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

Wait, perhaps it's easier to see where the change is. Let's compare each position.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, the first change is in the TTT part. Wild is TTT, mutant has TCT. Then, the next part in wild is CTC, and in mutant1, it's TAC.

So, in the wild, the sequence at positions 4-6 is TTT, in mutant1 it's TCT. Then, the next triplet changes from CTC (wild) to TAC (mutant1).

Wait, perhaps that's a missense mutation, changing the amino acids.

Similarly, we can look for each mutant.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, let's compare:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

So, perhaps the change is in the CTC part. Let me see: wild has CTC GCT, and mutant2 has CTA AGC?

Wait, wild has after TTCT, C GCTGGTACT.

Mutant2 has after TTCT, AAGCTGGTACT.

So, the wild in that area is CTC GCT. So, in the wild, perhaps it's CTC GCT. Mutant2 has AAGCT.

Wait, the exact change. Let's see the wild at positions 7-12:

Wild: CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant2: AAG CTT GGT ACT.

Wait, perhaps the change is CTC to AAG? Or perhaps more accurately, after the initial part, the wild is CTC, and mutant2 has AAG.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to line them up.

Wild: ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant2: ... TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT ...

Wait, perhaps in mutant2, the CTC becomes AAG, and the next part changes. Hmm.

Moving on to Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, let's see:

Wild: ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant3: ... TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACT.

Wait, so in the wild, it's TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT.

In mutant3, after TTT, it's TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, perhaps the change is at the TCT part. Let me compare:

Wild: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, so after the initial TTT, the wild has CTC, but mutant3 has TAC. So, the CTC becomes TAC. That's a point mutation.

Additionally, looking further, after GCT GGT, the wild has ACT TCT, and mutant3 has GTC ACT.

Wait, I think I need to look more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which mutations introduce a stop codon. Because if a stop codon is introduced early, the protein will be truncated, possibly making it nonfunctional.

Stop codons are TAG, TGA, and TAA. So, any mutation that creates one of these in the reading frame would be a nonsense mutation.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: I don't see a stop codon in the sequence provided. The end is ...TCGTCG... which is not a stop.

Mutant2: Ends with ...TCGCG... so no stop codon.

Mutant3: Ends with ...GTCACT... no stop. Wait, the reading frame continues.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, the wild has ...CGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant4 has ...CGCTACTTCT...

So, comparing:

Wild: CGCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant4: CGCT ACT TCT ...

Wait, so the wild is CGCT followed by GGT ACT TCT.

Mutant4: CGCT followed by ACT TCT.

So, perhaps the GGT in the wild is changed to ACT.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me look for any TGA or TAG or TAA in the sequences.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for stop codons:

Mutant1: Does it have a TGA anywhere? The end is ...TGA-3’ , but wait, the TGA is the stop codon at the very end, but in the wild, the sequence ends with ...TGA as well. Oh wait, the stop codon is at the end of the coding sequence. So, if a mutation introduces an earlier stop codon, that would be good.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: ...CGTCG... no stop.

Mutant2: ...CGCG... no.

Mutant3: ...CTGT... no.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT... no.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift, introducing a stop. But that's less likely with point mutations; frameshifts require insertions or deletions.

Wait, but looking at the sequences, all the changes are substitutions, not indels.

So, perhaps the best way is to look for any mutation that introduces a stop codon earlier.

Looking again, let's see each mutant's sequence:

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’

So the last codon is TGA, which stops.

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
So the last codon is still TGA. So no early stop.

Mutant2: 5’-ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
Same ending, TGA.

Mutant3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
Again, ends with TGA.

Mutant4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
Wait, in the given sequence, it's ...TACGCTACTTCT...

So the part is TAC GCT ACT TCT. So, the third codon is ACT, but let's see in terms of the triplet.

Wait, perhaps the point mutation in mutant4 affects the reading frame.

Wait, no, because it's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion. So the reading frame remains the same.

Wait, but let me see. The wild has in the first exon:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So the change is in the CTC (wild) to TAC (mutant4). So, the CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). Then, the next in wild is GCT (Ala), and in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the amino acids change, but no stop codon introduced.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the mutation causes a frameshift, but all the given sequences are about the same length, so probably point mutations.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the changes lead to the creation of a stop codon in the same reading frame earlier.

Wait, let's look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the sequences:

Mutant1: The sequence after the mutation is ... TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ... So, any TAG? No. TGA comes only at the end.

Mutant2: ... AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

AAG is a start codon? No, AAG is lysine. TAG isn't present.

Mutant3: ... TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

No stop codons except the last TGA.

Mutant4: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

No stop codons except the last TGA.

Hmm, so none of the mutations introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the mutations disrupt the reading frame in a way that causes a frameshift, resulting in a premature stop. But all the mutations are substitutions, which don't cause frameshifts.

Wait, unless one of the mutations is a nonsense mutation that doesn't create a stop codon but disrupts the protein structure. Alternatively, a missense mutation that disrupts the function.

So, if the gene product is an enzyme, perhaps a missense mutation that changes a critical amino acid could disable it.

But the question is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene produces this compound, so we need to disrupt its production.

If the mutation is a stop codon early in the sequence, the protein would be truncated, perhaps not functional.

But in the given options, none of the mutations except maybe one has a stop codon.

Wait, wait, let me look again.

Wait, the given sequences for the mutants all end with TGA. So, perhaps that's the normal stop codon, so any earlier stop would be better.

Looking again:

Mutant4's sequence: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Breaking it down:

... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Wait, the 'ACT' is Thr, 'TCT' is Ser, 'GTG' is Val, 'GAT' is Asp, 'GAA' is Glu, 'CAT' is His, 'ATT' is Ile, 'TAT' is Tyr, 'TTG' is Leu, 'TCG' is Ser, 'T' is the start of the next codon.

Wait, perhaps in mutant4, the sequence after the mutation is:

... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

So, the third codon in the mutant4 is ACT (Thr), whereas in wild it's GCT (Ala). So, a substitution from Ala to Thr. That's a missense mutation.

Hmm, I'm not finding any mutations that introduce a stop codon. So, maybe the correct approach is to look for a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene, perhaps creating a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the splicing of exons. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area. So, splicing would occur between exons, but if the first exon's sequence is changed, perhaps the splicing sites are affected. But in this case, the splicing is between exons, so if the donor or acceptor sites are mutated, it could cause incorrect splicing. However, I don't see any changes in the intron-exon boundaries because the sequences provided are the exons.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in a critical region of the exon, such as the start codon or a catalytic site.

Looking at the start codon: all mutants retain ATG, so the start codon is intact.

Mutant1 changes the second codon from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser). So, the amino acid changes from Phe to Ser. That's a conservative change, perhaps not disrupting the protein much.

Mutant2 changes the second codon from TTT to TCT (Ser), similar to mutant1, and the next codon from CTC (Leu) to AAG (Lys). Then perhaps another codon change.

Mutant3 changes the second codon from TTT to TTT (no change), but the next codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Then, perhaps other changes.

Wait, looking at the wild and each mutant's first few codons:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

So, codons 2 and 3 are changed.

Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Codons 2 and 3 changed.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Codons 3 and beyond changed.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Codon 3 changed: GCT (Ala) in wild to ACT (Thr) in mutant4.

Hmm. So, perhaps the most effective way to disrupt the gene is to introduce a nonsense mutation early, but I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon. Let me check again.

In mutant4, the sequence is:

... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Wait, but in the wild, the sequence continues beyond that. How long is the first exon?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: think about the structure of the mRNA. The first exon is at the beginning, so a frameshift or mutation causing a premature stop would be in the early part of the mRNA.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of a frameshift. But all the mutations given are point mutations (substitutions), so no frameshift.

Wait, but wait: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical region. Let me see.

In the wild, the sequence in the first exon starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA.

In mutant4, it's ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA.

So, the third codon in the wild is CTC (Leu), and in mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). Then, the fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr).

Wait, perhaps the change from CTC to TAC and GCT to ACT leads to a change in the amino acids, but maybe not a stop.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 changes the reading frame, but that's not possible with a substitution.

Wait, unless the mutation is a nonsense mutation within the same reading frame. Let's check for any TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at mutant4's sequence: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

No, I don't see any of those stop codons. So, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the mutation that disrupts the gene function, perhaps by nonsense or by causing a frameshift, but since it's a substitution, no frameshift.

Wait, maybe it's a nonsense mutation, but I don't see any in the sequences provided.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 occurs in such a way that the mRNA has a premature termination codon, leading to a truncated protein. But looking at the sequences, I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a nonfunctional protein. For example, a missense mutation in a critical region.

Wait, but without knowing the exact function of the protein, it's hard to say which amino acid change would be critical.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts a critical domain.

But I'm not given any information about the structure of the protein, only the gene sequences.

Wait, perhaps the answer lies in the fact that the anti-nutritional compound is a toxic compound, so disrupting the gene's function would eliminate it.

The best way is to disable the gene, perhaps via a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein.

But in the given sequences, only the last codon is TGA. So, perhaps none of the mutations create an earlier stop codon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant again:

Looking at Mutant4:

Wild: ...CGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ...CGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, so the wild is CGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4 is CGCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so in the wild, after CGCT comes GGT ACT TCT.

In mutant4, after CGCT comes ACT TCT.

So, in the wild, the fourth codon is GGT (Gly), and in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the codon changes from GGT to ACT. That's a change from Gly to Thr.

Then, the fifth codon in wild is TCT (Ser), and in mutant4, it's TCT as well.

Wait, so the codon after that is the same. So, perhaps the mutation doesn't introduce a stop.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region. But the sequences given are the exons, so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical splice site, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon, so the splice donor site (GU before the first exon) would be at the beginning, which isn't shown in the sequences.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a GGT (glycine) codon into ACT (threonine), which might not be as critical as other mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the mutation that disrupts most of the start of the gene. Let me think about the first few codons.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So, second codon TTT (Phe) becomes TCT (Ser). Third codon CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr).

So, the first few amino acids change from Phe-Leu to Ser-Tyr. Maybe that's a significant change.

Mutant2: changes the second codon from TTT to TCT (Ser), and the third from CTC to AAG (Lys). So, Phe-Leu becomes Ser-Lys.

Mutant3: changes the third codon from CTC to TAC (Tyr), and perhaps others.

Mutant4: changes the third codon from CTC to TAC (Tyr) and the fourth from GCT (Ala) to ACT (Thr).

So, which of these mutations would most likely disrupt the gene function? If the first few codons are critical, perhaps any of these would.

But without knowing the specific function, perhaps the best way is to look for the mutation that creates a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the position of the mutation. The question states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So, perhaps the best way is to find a mutation that disrupts the start of the gene.

Wait, looking at the first few nucleotides:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, the first codon is still ATG (Met). The second codon TTT changes to TCT, which is Ser instead of Phe.

Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT...

So, second codon TCT (Ser), third AAG (Lys).

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, third codon TAC (Tyr), and later GTC (Val).

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, third codon TAC (Tyr), fourth ACT (Thr).

Hmm. So, perhaps the most drastic change is in Mutant2, which changes two codons early on. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because in the first exon, the change leads to the introduction of a stop codon elsewhere, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the presence of a stop codon in the mutant sequences. Let me check again.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for any occurrence of TGA, TAG, or TAA before the end.

Wild: ... TGA at the end.

Mutant1: ... CGTCG... no stop.

Mutant2: ... CGCG... no.

Mutant3: ... CTGT... no.

Mutant4: ... GTCGT... no.

So, no early stops.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a splice donor or acceptor site mutation, messing up splicing. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon, which is before the introns. So, if the first exon is messed up, perhaps the splicing machinery can't recognize the intron boundaries.

Wait, the first exon-exon junction is at the end of the first exon. So, the splice donor site is before the first exon, and the acceptor site is between exons 1 and 2.

If a mutation occurs in the intron just after the first exon, it might affect splicing. But the mutations are in the first exon, so perhaps it's not affecting the splicing sites.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site within the exon, causing parts of the exon to be excluded.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a part that could disrupt the structure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the position of the mutations. Since the anti-nutritional compound is being produced, perhaps the gene's product is an enzyme that synthesizes it. If the mutation disrupts the enzyme's active site, the compound won't be made.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which mutant has the earliest possible stop codon.

Wait, but none of the mutations introduce an early stop codon. So, perhaps the best bet is to find the mutation that introduces the most drastic amino acid change, like a change in the second codon.

Wait, in Mutant2, the second codon is changed from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser), and the third from CTC (Leu) to AAG (Lys). Phe to Ser is a conservative change, but Leu to Lys is a bigger change.

In Mutant1, the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), which is a larger change.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to ACT (Thr). Ala to Thr is a conservative change, both being small, non-polar amino acids. So, that might not be as disruptive.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the mutation that creates a premature stop codon.

Wait, I've gone through each mutant and didn't find any creating an early stop.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the change leads to the introduction of a stop codon in the same frame. Let me check the reading frame.

Mutant4's sequence: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So, in triplets:

TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

No stop codons here, just TAC is Tyr, GCT is Ala, etc.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fourth codon from GCT to ACT, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein.

But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 introduces a stop codon in the middle of the sequence.

Wait, let me count the nucleotides to see if the mutation creates a new in-frame stop.

Hmm, perhaps I can look for a TGA in the middle.

Looking again:

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Wait, the TGA is still at the end. So, no earlier stop.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options and the possible answers.

The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely the one that introduces a stop codon or a major disruption.

Wait, perhaps I've missed a stop codon in Mutant4.

Wait, let me look again:

Mutant4's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Breaking it into triplets starting from ATG:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, the last part is TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, no, the TGA is the last codon, so all the prior codons are before that.

So, in Mutant4, the codons are:

ATG (1), TTT (2), TAC (3), GCT (4), ACT (5), TCT (6), GTG (7), GAT (8), GAA (9), CATA (10), and so on, ending with TGA.

So, no stop codons before the end.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the mutation changes a critical part of the gene, such as the start codon. But all the mutants have intact ATG.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the change in the third and fourth codons could lead to an altered protein that doesn't function. But without knowing the function, it's hard to be certain.

Another approach: perhaps the mutation leads to the production of a nonfunctional enzyme by altering the secondary structure.

But without specific info, perhaps the most likely is that the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts the gene function.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations were found in the first exon area. So, a frameshift in the first exon could disrupt the entire reading frame, but the mutations are substitutions, so no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter. But the sequences given seem to be coding regions.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should take a guess.

Wait, looking at all the options, the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene. The most effective way is to introduce a stop codon early. Since none of the mutations do that, perhaps the answer is the one where a stop codon is introduced inadvertently.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check each mutant again, looking for the presence of a stop codon anywhere except the end.

Mutant1: ... CGTCG ... No.

Mutant2: ...CGCG... No.

Mutant3: ...CTGT... No.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT... No.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the sequence in a way that could disrupt the gene's function, perhaps by changing multiple key amino acids. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the third codon from CTC to TAC and the fourth from GCT to ACT, which might be in a critical region.

Wait, another angle: the question says the anti-nutritional compound is impossible to use. So, the gene is responsible for its synthesis. By disrupting the gene, the compound won't be made. So, any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would work.

Given that, perhaps the best way is to look for a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene, such as the start codon or an early part, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But all start codons are intact.

Well, I'm going to have to make a decision here. Based on the options, the correct answer is likely D) Mutant4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the target gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or by significantly altering the protein structure (missense mutation).

   - Codon changes: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr), `GGT` (Gly) → `GTC` (Val).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes: `TTTCTCGCT` → `TTTTACGCT`.  
   - Codon changes: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr), `GCT` (Ala) → `ACT` (Thr).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  

### Conclusion:
None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (TAG, TGA, or TAA) before the natural stop codon at the end of the sequence. However, Mutant 4 introduces two significant changes: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) and `GCT` (Ala) → `ACT` (Thr). These changes could disrupt the protein's structure or function, making it the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

So, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound which makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene's sequence, especially in the first exon area, where some changes happened.

The question is asking which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or changing the protein structure so it doesn't produce the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different mutation in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations there can affect the protein product. Missense mutations change an amino acid, while nonsense mutations create a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.

Let's look at each mutant's change. The intact gene is given first, so I can compare each mutant to that.

The wild type (intact) sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
So, looking at the beginning:

Positions 1-15: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT

Now, let me compare each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the change is at the fifth or sixth position. Let me look. The wild type has TTTCTCGC. Wait, let's see:

Wild type exon 1 starts: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, breaking it down:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Hmm. So, the first part is ATG, then in wild it's TTT CTC, and in mutant 1 it's TCT TAC. Wait, so that's a substitution. Let me count the nucleotides. Let's see:

Wild: positions 4-8: TTTCT (so letters 4-8 are T, T, T, C, T)
Mutant 1: positions 4-8: TCTAC (T, C, T, A, C). Wait, that's a substitution of the TTTCT into TCTAC? Or maybe I miscounted.

Wait, maybe it's better to compare each position:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, perhaps in wild, the next few are TTTCT, and in mutant1, it's TCTAC. So what's the change? Let's line them up:

Wild: positions 1-20: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 etc.

Wait, perhaps I can write the wild and mutant sequences for the affected area.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So, the change is in the fifth and sixth nucleotides. Wait, the first part is ATGTTTCT... in wild, and ATGTTCT... in mutant 1.

Wait, the exact change: in wild, the next after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, I think the first four nucleotides are the same: ATG T. Then in wild, it's TTTCT, and in mutant1, it's TCTAC.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact nucleotide changes.

Let me write the wild and mutant sequences for the first 20 nucleotides.

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Looking at the first part:

Wild: positions 4-8: T T T C T

Mutant1: positions 4-8: T C T A C

So, the changes are: the third T becomes a C, the C becomes a T, and the T becomes an A? Or perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, perhaps better to number each position.

Wild: 1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

Wait, perhaps it's easier to see where the change is. Let's compare each position.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, the first change is in the TTT part. Wild is TTT, mutant has TCT. Then, the next part in wild is CTC, and in mutant1, it's TAC.

So, in the wild, the sequence at positions 4-6 is TTT, in mutant1 it's TCT. Then, the next triplet changes from CTC (wild) to TAC (mutant1).

Wait, perhaps that's a missense mutation, changing the amino acids.

Similarly, we can look for each mutant.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, let's compare:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

So, perhaps the change is in the CTC part. Let me see: wild has CTC GCT, and mutant2 has CTA AGC?

Wait, wild has after TTCT, C GCTGGTACT.

Mutant2 has after TTCT, AAGCTGGTACT.

So, the wild in that area is CTC GCT. So, in the wild, perhaps it's CTC GCT. Mutant2 has AAGCT.

Wait, the exact change. Let's see the wild at positions 7-12:

Wild: CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant2: AAG CTT GGT ACT.

Wait, perhaps the change is CTC to AAG? Or perhaps more accurately, after the initial part, the wild is CTC, and mutant2 has AAG.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to line them up.

Wild: ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant2: ... TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT ...

Wait, perhaps in mutant2, the CTC becomes AAG, and the next part changes. Hmm.

Moving on to Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, let's see:

Wild: ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant3: ... TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACT.

Wait, so in the wild, it's TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT.

In mutant3, after TTT, it's TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, perhaps the change is at the TCT part. Let me compare:

Wild: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, so after the initial TTT, the wild has CTC, but mutant3 has TAC. So, the CTC becomes TAC. That's a point mutation.

Additionally, looking further, after GCT GGT, the wild has ACT TCT, and mutant3 has GTC ACT.

Wait, I think I need to look more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which mutations introduce a stop codon. Because if a stop codon is introduced early, the protein will be truncated, possibly making it nonfunctional.

Stop codons are TAG, TGA, and TAA. So, any mutation that creates one of these in the reading frame would be a nonsense mutation.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: I don't see a stop codon in the sequence provided. The end is ...TCGTCG... which is not a stop.

Mutant2: Ends with ...TCGCG... so no stop codon.

Mutant3: Ends with ...GTCACT... no stop. Wait, the reading frame continues.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, the wild has ...CGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant4 has ...CGCTACTTCT...

So, comparing:

Wild: CGCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant4: CGCT ACT TCT ...

Wait, so the wild is CGCT followed by GGT ACT TCT.

Mutant4: CGCT followed by ACT TCT.

So, perhaps the GGT in the wild is changed to ACT.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me look for any TGA or TAG or TAA in the sequences.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for stop codons:

Mutant1: Does it have a TGA anywhere? The end is ...TGA-3’ , but wait, the TGA is the stop codon at the very end, but in the wild, the sequence ends with ...TGA as well. Oh wait, the stop codon is at the end of the coding sequence. So, if a mutation introduces an earlier stop codon, that would be good.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: ...CGTCG... no stop.

Mutant2: ...CGCG... no.

Mutant3: ...CTGT... no.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT... no.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift, introducing a stop. But that's less likely with point mutations; frameshifts require insertions or deletions.

Wait, but looking at the sequences, all the changes are substitutions, not indels.

So, perhaps the best way is to look for any mutation that introduces a stop codon earlier.

Looking again, let's see each mutant's sequence:

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’

So the last codon is TGA, which stops.

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
So the last codon is still TGA. So no early stop.

Mutant2: 5’-ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
Same ending, TGA.

Mutant3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
Again, ends with TGA.

Mutant4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA-3’
Wait, in the given sequence, it's ...TACGCTACTTCT...

So the part is TAC GCT ACT TCT. So, the third codon is ACT, but let's see in terms of the triplet.

Wait, perhaps the point mutation in mutant4 affects the reading frame.

Wait, no, because it's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion. So the reading frame remains the same.

Wait, but let me see. The wild has in the first exon:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So the change is in the CTC (wild) to TAC (mutant4). So, the CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). Then, the next in wild is GCT (Ala), and in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the amino acids change, but no stop codon introduced.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the mutation causes a frameshift, but all the given sequences are about the same length, so probably point mutations.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the changes lead to the creation of a stop codon in the same reading frame earlier.

Wait, let's look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the sequences:

Mutant1: The sequence after the mutation is ... TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ... So, any TAG? No. TGA comes only at the end.

Mutant2: ... AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

AAG is a start codon? No, AAG is lysine. TAG isn't present.

Mutant3: ... TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

No stop codons except the last TGA.

Mutant4: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

No stop codons except the last TGA.

Hmm, so none of the mutations introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the mutations disrupt the reading frame in a way that causes a frameshift, resulting in a premature stop. But all the mutations are substitutions, which don't cause frameshifts.

Wait, unless one of the mutations is a nonsense mutation that doesn't create a stop codon but disrupts the protein structure. Alternatively, a missense mutation that disrupts the function.

So, if the gene product is an enzyme, perhaps a missense mutation that changes a critical amino acid could disable it.

But the question is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene produces this compound, so we need to disrupt its production.

If the mutation is a stop codon early in the sequence, the protein would be truncated, perhaps not functional.

But in the given options, none of the mutations except maybe one has a stop codon.

Wait, wait, let me look again.

Wait, the given sequences for the mutants all end with TGA. So, perhaps that's the normal stop codon, so any earlier stop would be better.

Looking again:

Mutant4's sequence: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Breaking it down:

... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Wait, the 'ACT' is Thr, 'TCT' is Ser, 'GTG' is Val, 'GAT' is Asp, 'GAA' is Glu, 'CAT' is His, 'ATT' is Ile, 'TAT' is Tyr, 'TTG' is Leu, 'TCG' is Ser, 'T' is the start of the next codon.

Wait, perhaps in mutant4, the sequence after the mutation is:

... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

So, the third codon in the mutant4 is ACT (Thr), whereas in wild it's GCT (Ala). So, a substitution from Ala to Thr. That's a missense mutation.

Hmm, I'm not finding any mutations that introduce a stop codon. So, maybe the correct approach is to look for a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene, perhaps creating a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the splicing of exons. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area. So, splicing would occur between exons, but if the first exon's sequence is changed, perhaps the splicing sites are affected. But in this case, the splicing is between exons, so if the donor or acceptor sites are mutated, it could cause incorrect splicing. However, I don't see any changes in the intron-exon boundaries because the sequences provided are the exons.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in a critical region of the exon, such as the start codon or a catalytic site.

Looking at the start codon: all mutants retain ATG, so the start codon is intact.

Mutant1 changes the second codon from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser). So, the amino acid changes from Phe to Ser. That's a conservative change, perhaps not disrupting the protein much.

Mutant2 changes the second codon from TTT to TCT (Ser), similar to mutant1, and the next codon from CTC (Leu) to AAG (Lys). Then perhaps another codon change.

Mutant3 changes the second codon from TTT to TTT (no change), but the next codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Then, perhaps other changes.

Wait, looking at the wild and each mutant's first few codons:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

So, codons 2 and 3 are changed.

Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Codons 2 and 3 changed.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Codons 3 and beyond changed.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Codon 3 changed: GCT (Ala) in wild to ACT (Thr) in mutant4.

Hmm. So, perhaps the most effective way to disrupt the gene is to introduce a nonsense mutation early, but I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon. Let me check again.

In mutant4, the sequence is:

... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA ...

Wait, but in the wild, the sequence continues beyond that. How long is the first exon?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: think about the structure of the mRNA. The first exon is at the beginning, so a frameshift or mutation causing a premature stop would be in the early part of the mRNA.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of a frameshift. But all the mutations given are point mutations (substitutions), so no frameshift.

Wait, but wait: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical region. Let me see.

In the wild, the sequence in the first exon starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA.

In mutant4, it's ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... TGA.

So, the third codon in the wild is CTC (Leu), and in mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). Then, the fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr).

Wait, perhaps the change from CTC to TAC and GCT to ACT leads to a change in the amino acids, but maybe not a stop.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 changes the reading frame, but that's not possible with a substitution.

Wait, unless the mutation is a nonsense mutation within the same reading frame. Let's check for any TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at mutant4's sequence: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

No, I don't see any of those stop codons. So, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the mutation that disrupts the gene function, perhaps by nonsense or by causing a frameshift, but since it's a substitution, no frameshift.

Wait, maybe it's a nonsense mutation, but I don't see any in the sequences provided.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 occurs in such a way that the mRNA has a premature termination codon, leading to a truncated protein. But looking at the sequences, I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a nonfunctional protein. For example, a missense mutation in a critical region.

Wait, but without knowing the exact function of the protein, it's hard to say which amino acid change would be critical.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts a critical domain.

But I'm not given any information about the structure of the protein, only the gene sequences.

Wait, perhaps the answer lies in the fact that the anti-nutritional compound is a toxic compound, so disrupting the gene's function would eliminate it.

The best way is to disable the gene, perhaps via a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein.

But in the given sequences, only the last codon is TGA. So, perhaps none of the mutations create an earlier stop codon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant again:

Looking at Mutant4:

Wild: ...CGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ...CGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, so the wild is CGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4 is CGCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so in the wild, after CGCT comes GGT ACT TCT.

In mutant4, after CGCT comes ACT TCT.

So, in the wild, the fourth codon is GGT (Gly), and in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the codon changes from GGT to ACT. That's a change from Gly to Thr.

Then, the fifth codon in wild is TCT (Ser), and in mutant4, it's TCT as well.

Wait, so the codon after that is the same. So, perhaps the mutation doesn't introduce a stop.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region. But the sequences given are the exons, so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical splice site, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon, so the splice donor site (GU before the first exon) would be at the beginning, which isn't shown in the sequences.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a GGT (glycine) codon into ACT (threonine), which might not be as critical as other mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the mutation that disrupts most of the start of the gene. Let me think about the first few codons.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So, second codon TTT (Phe) becomes TCT (Ser). Third codon CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr).

So, the first few amino acids change from Phe-Leu to Ser-Tyr. Maybe that's a significant change.

Mutant2: changes the second codon from TTT to TCT (Ser), and the third from CTC to AAG (Lys). So, Phe-Leu becomes Ser-Lys.

Mutant3: changes the third codon from CTC to TAC (Tyr), and perhaps others.

Mutant4: changes the third codon from CTC to TAC (Tyr) and the fourth from GCT (Ala) to ACT (Thr).

So, which of these mutations would most likely disrupt the gene function? If the first few codons are critical, perhaps any of these would.

But without knowing the specific function, perhaps the best way is to look for the mutation that creates a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the position of the mutation. The question states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So, perhaps the best way is to find a mutation that disrupts the start of the gene.

Wait, looking at the first few nucleotides:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, the first codon is still ATG (Met). The second codon TTT changes to TCT, which is Ser instead of Phe.

Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT...

So, second codon TCT (Ser), third AAG (Lys).

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, third codon TAC (Tyr), and later GTC (Val).

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, third codon TAC (Tyr), fourth ACT (Thr).

Hmm. So, perhaps the most drastic change is in Mutant2, which changes two codons early on. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because in the first exon, the change leads to the introduction of a stop codon elsewhere, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the presence of a stop codon in the mutant sequences. Let me check again.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for any occurrence of TGA, TAG, or TAA before the end.

Wild: ... TGA at the end.

Mutant1: ... CGTCG... no stop.

Mutant2: ... CGCG... no.

Mutant3: ... CTGT... no.

Mutant4: ... GTCGT... no.

So, no early stops.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a splice donor or acceptor site mutation, messing up splicing. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon, which is before the introns. So, if the first exon is messed up, perhaps the splicing machinery can't recognize the intron boundaries.

Wait, the first exon-exon junction is at the end of the first exon. So, the splice donor site is before the first exon, and the acceptor site is between exons 1 and 2.

If a mutation occurs in the intron just after the first exon, it might affect splicing. But the mutations are in the first exon, so perhaps it's not affecting the splicing sites.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site within the exon, causing parts of the exon to be excluded.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a part that could disrupt the structure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the position of the mutations. Since the anti-nutritional compound is being produced, perhaps the gene's product is an enzyme that synthesizes it. If the mutation disrupts the enzyme's active site, the compound won't be made.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which mutant has the earliest possible stop codon.

Wait, but none of the mutations introduce an early stop codon. So, perhaps the best bet is to find the mutation that introduces the most drastic amino acid change, like a change in the second codon.

Wait, in Mutant2, the second codon is changed from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser), and the third from CTC (Leu) to AAG (Lys). Phe to Ser is a conservative change, but Leu to Lys is a bigger change.

In Mutant1, the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), which is a larger change.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to ACT (Thr). Ala to Thr is a conservative change, both being small, non-polar amino acids. So, that might not be as disruptive.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the mutation that creates a premature stop codon.

Wait, I've gone through each mutant and didn't find any creating an early stop.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the change leads to the introduction of a stop codon in the same frame. Let me check the reading frame.

Mutant4's sequence: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So, in triplets:

TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

No stop codons here, just TAC is Tyr, GCT is Ala, etc.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fourth codon from GCT to ACT, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein.

But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 introduces a stop codon in the middle of the sequence.

Wait, let me count the nucleotides to see if the mutation creates a new in-frame stop.

Hmm, perhaps I can look for a TGA in the middle.

Looking again:

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Wait, the TGA is still at the end. So, no earlier stop.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options and the possible answers.

The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely the one that introduces a stop codon or a major disruption.

Wait, perhaps I've missed a stop codon in Mutant4.

Wait, let me look again:

Mutant4's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Breaking it into triplets starting from ATG:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, the last part is TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, no, the TGA is the last codon, so all the prior codons are before that.

So, in Mutant4, the codons are:

ATG (1), TTT (2), TAC (3), GCT (4), ACT (5), TCT (6), GTG (7), GAT (8), GAA (9), CATA (10), and so on, ending with TGA.

So, no stop codons before the end.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the mutation changes a critical part of the gene, such as the start codon. But all the mutants have intact ATG.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the change in the third and fourth codons could lead to an altered protein that doesn't function. But without knowing the function, it's hard to be certain.

Another approach: perhaps the mutation leads to the production of a nonfunctional enzyme by altering the secondary structure.

But without specific info, perhaps the most likely is that the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts the gene function.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations were found in the first exon area. So, a frameshift in the first exon could disrupt the entire reading frame, but the mutations are substitutions, so no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter. But the sequences given seem to be coding regions.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should take a guess.

Wait, looking at all the options, the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene. The most effective way is to introduce a stop codon early. Since none of the mutations do that, perhaps the answer is the one where a stop codon is introduced inadvertently.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check each mutant again, looking for the presence of a stop codon anywhere except the end.

Mutant1: ... CGTCG ... No.

Mutant2: ...CGCG... No.

Mutant3: ...CTGT... No.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT... No.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the sequence in a way that could disrupt the gene's function, perhaps by changing multiple key amino acids. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the third codon from CTC to TAC and the fourth from GCT to ACT, which might be in a critical region.

Wait, another angle: the question says the anti-nutritional compound is impossible to use. So, the gene is responsible for its synthesis. By disrupting the gene, the compound won't be made. So, any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would work.

Given that, perhaps the best way is to look for a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene, such as the start codon or an early part, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But all start codons are intact.

Well, I'm going to have to make a decision here. Based on the options, the correct answer is likely D) Mutant4.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the target gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or by significantly altering the protein structure (missense mutation).

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   The sequence starts with `ATG` (start codon), followed by `TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT`, and ends with `TGA` (stop codon).

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes: `TTTCTCGCT` → `TCTTACGCT`.  
   - Codon changes: `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser), `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes: `TTTCTCGCT` → `TCTAAGCTT`.  
   - Codon changes: `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser), `CTC` (Leu) → `AAG` (Lys).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes: `TTTCTCGCT` → `TTTTACGCT`.  
   - Codon changes: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr), `GGT` (Gly) → `GTC` (Val).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes: `TTTCTCGCT` → `TTTTACGCT`.  
   - Codon changes: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr), `GCT` (Ala) → `ACT` (Thr).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  

### Conclusion:
None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (TAG, TGA, or TAA) before the natural stop codon at the end of the sequence. However, Mutant 4 introduces two significant changes: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) and `GCT` (Ala) → `ACT` (Thr). These changes could disrupt the protein's structure or function, making it the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
