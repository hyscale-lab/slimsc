Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cyclotrons, but I'll try to think this through. Let's read the question again.

So, a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T≈0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T₁ = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U₀ cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀], and the given data is Φ₀ = π/4 and U₀ = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait, what do I remember about synchrocyclotrons? I think they're a type of cyclotron that can accelerate particles to higher energies because their magnetic field isn't constant. Synchrocyclotrons have a magnetic field that increases with time, allowing the particles to keep moving in a spiral and gain more energy with each revolution. But wait, actually, I might be mixing that up with other types of cyclotrons. Let me think. Oh right, the main cyclotron keeps the magnetic field constant, but synchrocyclotrons vary the field so the radius of the particle's path changes over time. Or wait, no, maybe it's the frequency that changes. I'm a bit confused here, but maybe I can proceed.

The key point is that the proton is accelerated by the electric field of the voltage. The voltage is alternating, so it's providing an electric field that does work on the proton. Since the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, the voltage is doing all the work to accelerate it to 950 MeV.

Wait, but the voltage is 190 kV, which is 0.190 MeV, right? Because 1 eV is 10^-6 MeV, so 190,000 eV is 0.190 MeV. So each time the proton goes through a potential difference of U₀, it gains some energy. But wait, the voltage is applied as a cosine function. So the maximum voltage is 190 kV.

But wait, the voltage is varying with time as U(t) = U₀ cos(θ), where θ is 2πν α t + Φ₀. Hmm, but what's ν here? Is that a fixed frequency or does it change with time? Wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is adjusted so that the particle's orbit time matches the period of the field. So the frequency ν is not constant but varies with time to keep the phase in sync with the particle's motion.

So the idea is that the proton is being accelerated each time it goes around the synchrocyclotron. Each time it completes a revolution, it gains some energy from the electric field. So the number of revolutions needed would be the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

But wait, the total kinetic energy is 950 MeV, but each time the proton goes through the electric field, it gains some energy. Since the voltage is U₀ cos(...), the maximum energy gain per half-cycle would be U₀. But wait, actually, the maximum energy gain for one full cycle would be 2U₀, because each peak of the cosine wave is a maximum. Or wait, no, because each time the electric field changes direction, the proton is accelerated in the opposite direction. So each time the field completes a cycle, the proton might have gained energy twice—once when the field is positive and once when it's negative.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, the kinetic energy of the proton is T = (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so p starts at zero. The final kinetic energy is 950 MeV.

The voltage is given as U(t) = U₀ cos(2π ν α t + Φ₀). Hmm, the term ν is the angular frequency? Wait, no, 2π ν would be the angular frequency. Wait, actually, the argument is 2π ν α t + Φ₀. Wait, perhaps ν is a function of time, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe α is a function of time, which would change the frequency?

Wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency at which the voltage is applied is related to the cyclotron frequency, which is determined by the magnetic field and the particle's mass and charge. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field increases with time, the frequency also changes. So the frequency ν is adjusted to match the proton's changing orbit time.

But I might be getting into more complicated aspects here. Let's think about the energy transfer. The electric field does work on the proton each time it passes through the gap. The energy gained per revolution would depend on the voltage. Since the voltage is varying sinusoidally, the average energy gain per revolution might be something like U₀ times some factor.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy gained by the proton is equal to the work done by the electric field. The work done per unit charge is the potential difference across the gap. So each time the proton goes through a half-cycle of the electric field (from peak to peak?), it gains energy equal to the voltage times the charge, but considering the maximum voltage.

Wait, but the voltage is U₀ cos(...), with a maximum of U₀. So each time the proton goes through the gap, it might gain U₀ eV. But wait, because the potential is applied across the gap, the maximum change in potential is U₀. So each time the proton passes through, it gains energy equal to the maximum voltage multiplied by e (elementary charge). But wait, the proton goes around, and each time it's accelerated once per half-period of the voltage. Or perhaps once per full period?

Wait, in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field. The frequency of the electric field is set so that when the proton completes a half-circle, the electric field direction is reversed, allowing for continuous acceleration. That is, the electric field alternates each half-period of the cyclotron's motion.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is adjusted as the proton's mass or velocity changes. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can model each revolution as providing a certain energy gain.

So, each time the proton makes a revolution, it gains an energy of 2*U₀, because it goes through the electric field twice (once in each direction) per full cycle. Or wait, maybe each half-revolution is when the field changes direction. So, perhaps each time the proton completes a full revolution, it gains 2U₀, because it's accelerated twice.

Wait, perhaps each revolution corresponds to one acceleration, but with the voltage varying, the mean energy per revolution would be higher? Or maybe the energy per revolution is U₀, because each time the field returns to the same phase, the proton gains a certain amount of energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the energy gained in each acceleration, which happens every half-period. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the number of times the voltage has cycled. The total time the proton is in the synchrocyclotron is the time it takes to reach 950 MeV starting from rest. Then, the number of revolutions is the number of times the proton has orbited, which would relate to the total time and the orbital period.

Wait, but the orbital period changes as the proton's speed increases because the magnetic field in a synchrocyclotron increases. So each time the proton gains energy, the radius increases, and the period changes. That complicates things because the period isn't constant.

Hmm, but perhaps we can make an approximation. If the magnetic field is varying with time, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, the variation is such that each revolution corresponds to a fixed energy gain.

Wait, another approach. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is the integral of the power delivered by the electric field. The power is the force times velocity, or equivalently, the electric field times current. But perhaps it's easier to model the energy transfer per revolution.

Wait, the maximum energy gain per revolution would be 2 * e * U₀, because each time the field reverses, the proton gains energy once. So each half-cycle (half period) of the voltage corresponds to one acceleration.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t)=U₀ cos(...), which has a period of T=1/ν. So each full period, the voltage goes positive, then negative, then positive again. So for each full period, the proton would be accelerated twice—once when the voltage is positive and once when it's negative. So each period contributes two energy gains.

Wait, but how much energy is gained each time? The maximum energy gain per half-period (i.e., each time the voltage is at its peak) would be e*U₀. So each full period would give 2 * e * U₀ energy to the proton.

But wait, let me think again. The voltage is varying sinusoidally, so the average energy gain per revolution might be different. Alternatively, perhaps each full cycle of the voltage provides a certain amount of energy to the proton.

Wait, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is e * U₀, because each time the proton goes through a 180-degree change in the electric field, it gains U₀ eV. Or maybe it's e * U₀ per half-cycle.

Alternatively, consider that each time the voltage completes a full cycle, the proton gains e * (U₀) energy twice, once in each direction. So 2 e U₀ per cycle.

Wait, but this is getting a bit unclear. Let me try to think about the energy equation.

The total kinetic energy is T = 950 MeV. The initial energy is zero. So the total work done by the electric field is 950 MeV.

Each time the proton goes through a potential difference ΔV, it gains energy ΔE = e ΔV. But the applied voltage is U(t) = U₀ cos(...), which varies with time. But the maximum voltage is U₀, so each time the proton goes through the accelerating gap, it gains e U₀.

Wait, but when the voltage is at maximum, it's U₀. But the phase is given as Phi0 = pi/4. So does that affect the number of times the proton is accelerated?

Wait, maybe the number of times the voltage peaks corresponds to the number of revolutions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the voltage completes a half-cycle, the proton is accelerated once. So each time the voltage goes from 0 to U₀ and back, that's a full cycle, but the proton is accelerated once when the voltage is at its positive peak.

Wait, no, because in reality, the acceleration happens each time the electric field is applied in a particular direction. So for each half-period of the voltage, the proton is accelerated once, leading to an energy gain of e U₀.

Therefore, the number of revolutions (which would correspond to the number of half-cycles of the voltage) would be the total energy divided by energy per revolution.

Wait, let's model this.

Energy per half-cycle (i.e., each time the voltage goes from 0 to U₀ and back to 0) is e U₀. Each revolution corresponds to one such half-cycle. So the number of half-cycles is T_total * 2 * pi * nu, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the total energy as the sum of the energy gained in each half-cycle.

Each half-cycle, the proton gains energy e U₀.

The total number of half-cycles is N, so the total energy is N e U₀ = 950 MeV.

Given that e U₀ is 190 kV * e, which is 190 keV (since e is 1.6e-19 C, but here it would just be 190 kV * e = 190 keV).

So 190 keV per half-cycle. So N = (950 MeV) / (190 keV) = ?

Wait, 1 MeV is 1e3 keV, so 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

So N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV = 5000.

So N is 5000 half-cycles. But each half-cycle corresponds to one revolution, right? Because each time the voltage goes from 0 to U₀ and back, that's a half-cycle, and the proton goes around once.

Wait, but wait. Is each half-cycle a revolution? Or is a full cycle (two half-cycles) one revolution?

Hmm. Let me think about the operation of a cyclotron. The electric field alternates every half-period of the cyclotron's motion. So each time the proton completes a half-circle, the field reverses. So each full revolution would correspond to two field reversals, meaning two voltage half-cycles. So each revolution would involve two energy gains.

Wait, but that would mean that the number of revolutions is N_rev = N_half_cycles / 2.

Because each revolution involves two half-cycles of the voltage.

Wait, so if I have N half-cycles, that's N/2 revolutions.

In our case, N_half_cycles = 5000, so N_rev = 2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500.

Wait, but let me double-check this reasoning.

Each half-cycle of the voltage corresponds to the proton moving through a 180-degree sector of the cyclotron, gaining energy once. So each half-cycle is a half-revolution? Or does each half-cycle correspond to a full revolution?

Hmm, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think about the cyclotron's operation.

In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across the gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. The field alternates every time the proton passes through the gap. The frequency of the alternating field is the cyclotron frequency, which is determined by the magnetic field and the mass of the proton.

So each time the proton completes a half-circle (moving from one D to the other), the electric field changes direction, allowing the proton to be accelerated again. So each full revolution (a full circle) would involve two such accelerations.

So each revolution (full circle) corresponds to two half-cycles (two peaks) of the voltage.

So if the voltage completes a full cycle (two half-cycles), the proton has made one full revolution.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each time the field reverses direction, the proton is accelerated once. So for each half-cycle of the voltage (from 0 to U₀ to 0), the proton completes a half-circle, gains energy, and then the field reverses, allowing another acceleration in the next half-circle, completing a full revolution.

So each full revolution requires two half-cycles of the voltage, and each half-cycle provides an energy gain of e U₀.

In this case, the number of half-cycles is N = 5000. Each revolution uses two half-cycles, so the number of revolutions is N / 2 = 2500.

So the answer would be D) 2500.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the problem again.

The voltage is given as U(t) = U₀ cos(2π ν α t + Φ₀). Hmm, but what is ν here? Is it a fixed frequency, or does it vary?

Wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted so that it matches the proton's orbital frequency as the proton's speed increases. So as the proton gains energy, the magnetic field increases, so the cyclotron frequency would normally change, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted to keep step with it.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the exact details of frequency adjustment aren't needed because the question is about the number of revolutions based on the total energy gained.

Another approach: the number of revolutions is the total change in the magnetic rigidity divided by the initial change. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the kinetic energy T is related to the momentum p via T = p²/(2m). Since the initial T is negligible, the final p is approximately sqrt(2mT). So p = sqrt(2m T).

The magnetic rigidity is Bρ = p/(q), where ρ is the radius of the orbit, and B is the magnetic field.

But in a synchrocyclotron, B increases with time to keep the frequency of the electric field in sync with the proton's motion. So each time the proton gains energy, the radius increases because B increases.

But since the number of revolutions depends on the time spent in the synchrocyclotron, and the time depends on the varying magnetic field, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the time taken to reach the final energy can be found, and the number of revolutions is the time divided by the average period of each revolution.

But this seems complicated. Maybe the initial approach I took, considering the energy per revolution, is more straightforward.

Wait, let me recap: each half-cycle of the voltage provides an energy gain of e U₀. The total energy is 950 MeV. So the number of half-cycles is 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) = 5000 half-cycles. Each half-cycle corresponds to one revolution? Or two?

Wait, earlier I thought each half-cycle corresponds to a half-revolution. So one full revolution would take two half-cycles. Therefore, the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500.

But wait, the phase constant Phi0 is pi/4. Does that affect the number of times the voltage is at its peak during the acceleration? Like, if the phase is pi/4, perhaps the first acceleration occurs at a different point in the cycle, but I don't think that affects the total number of revolutions because the number of times the voltage peaks would still be the same regardless of where you start.

Wait, but maybe the initial phase affects whether the first acceleration is a positive or negative peak. But since the phase is pi/4, the first acceleration will be at a point where the voltage is cos(pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2 U₀, not the maximum. Hmm, but the maximum acceleration occurs when the voltage is at its peak. So perhaps each time the voltage is at a peak, the proton gains the maximum energy of e U₀.

But the phase might cause the first acceleration to occur at a lower voltage. But if the voltage starts at cos(pi/4), the first time the voltage reaches its maximum would be after a quarter period.

Wait, perhaps the initial phase affects the timing but not the total number of peaks encountered. Because regardless of the starting phase, the number of times the voltage reaches its maximum (and thus provides a maximum energy gain) during the acceleration process would still be proportional to the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of times the voltage peaks is the same as the number of times the proton is accelerated to the maximum.

But I'm not sure. Let's think: the number of maximums (peaks) the voltage reaches during the time the proton is accelerated is roughly the same as the number of half-cycles, but perhaps the initial phase would cause the first peak to be missed or something.

Wait, but the initial phase is given as pi/4, so when t=0, the phase is pi/4. So the function is U(t) = U0 cos(2 pi nu alpha t + pi/4). The first time the cosine reaches its maximum (which is when the argument is 0 mod 2 pi) would be when 2 pi nu alpha t + pi/4 = 0 mod 2 pi. So t = (-pi/4) / (2 pi nu alpha) = -1/(8 nu alpha). But since t can't be negative, the first peak occurs when the argument reaches 2 pi - pi/4 = 7pi/4. So the first peak is at t where 2 pi nu alpha t + pi/4 = 2 pi. So 2 pi nu alpha t = 2 pi - pi/4 = 7 pi/4. So t = (7 pi/4) / (2 pi nu alpha) )= 7/(8 nu alpha). So the first maximum occurs after a certain time, but perhaps the initial phase doesn't change the total number of peaks because the number is determined by the total time multiplied by the frequency.

But perhaps the time taken to reach the final energy depends on the phase, but the total number of revolutions may not be directly affected because the phase only shifts when the first peak occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase doesn't influence the number of peaks because the number is determined by the total energy and the energy per peak.

Hmm, perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions, so we can proceed under the assumption that the number of revolutions is 2500.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2500.

But wait, another point: the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, what does that mean?

Wait, the question says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV. Hmm, that part confused me. Does that mean that each acceleration step provides a certain energy gain, and two steps are done? Or is it that there are two acceleration regions in the synchrocyclotron?

Wait, maybe the question is saying that the proton is accelerated twice in the machine to reach the final energy. Hmm, but that contradicts the earlier part. Or perhaps it's a translation issue. Wait, the question says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV." Hmm, perhaps this is a mistranslation, but perhaps it means that the proton is accelerated twice, so each acceleration contributes to the final energy.

Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. Because 190 keV per acceleration and two accelerations would give 380 keV, which is way less than 950 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the 'two accelerations' refers to the fact that the synchrocyclotron uses both positive and negative voltages to accelerate the proton each time it passes through the gap. So each half-cycle of the voltage provides one acceleration. So each full cycle provides two accelerations.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If the total energy is 950 MeV, and each acceleration (i.e., each time the proton passes through the electric field) gives e U₀, which is 190 keV, then the number of accelerations would be 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000.

So number of accelerations is 5000.

Each revolution consists of two accelerations because each time the proton goes around once, it passes through the gap twice (once in each direction), so each revolution has two accelerations.

Wait, that would make the number of revolutions 5000 / 2 = 2500.

So the answer is D) 2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy transfer process. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated by the alternating voltage \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The proton reaches a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   Each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains energy from the electric field. The voltage \(U(t)\) oscillates sinusoidally, and the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once in each direction). The energy gained per revolution is approximately \(2eU_0\), where \(e\) is the elementary charge and \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\). Thus, the energy gained per revolution is \(2 \times 190 \, \text{kV} = 380 \, \text{kV}\).

2. **Total Energy and Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy gained by the proton is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). Converting this to keV:  
   \[
   T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV}.
   \]  
   The number of revolutions \(N\) is given by dividing the total energy by the energy gained per revolution:  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{\text{Energy per revolution}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{380 \, \text{keV}} = 2500.
   \]

3. **Impact of Initial Phase**:  
   The initial phase \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) affects the timing of the first acceleration but does not change the total number of revolutions, as the phase shift does not alter the total energy or the frequency of energy gain.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the final kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\).
