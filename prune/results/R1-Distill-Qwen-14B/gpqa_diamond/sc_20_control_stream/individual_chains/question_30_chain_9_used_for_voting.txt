Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. But wait, the question is about the color that's absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. Or does it emit the complementary color? I'm a bit confused.

The dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. I think conjugated systems are related to the molecule's ability to absorb light, especially in the visible range. The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO determines the wavelength absorbed. Oh right, the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to that gap.

The energy given is 2.3393 eV. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ. So I can calculate the wavelength to find out which color it is.

Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Wait, but I need to convert eV to joules because the units have to match. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that.

So 2.3393 * 1.602 is approximately 3.745, so 3.745e-19 J. Now plug into E=hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

So λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.745e-19 J) → Let me compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 3.745e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 /3.745e-19 = approximately 5.31e-7 meters. Wait, 5.31e-7 meters is 531 nm. Because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 5.31e-7 m is 531 nm.

Wait, 531 nm is in the visible spectrum. I remember the colors: red is around 700 nm, orange ~600, yellow ~580, green ~530 (wait, that's close), blue ~450, and violet ~400. So 531 is near the green region. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. Oh, wait, if the dye emits that energy, then it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, right? Because when something is excited, it emits lower energy photons. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, actually, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited from a lower energy state (like the ground state) to a higher energy state (like the excited state). The energy gap corresponds to the absorbed photon's energy. The emitted light would be when it drops from that higher state to a lower one, perhaps not all the way back. But in this case, the question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of ~531 nm (green). But the absorbed light would have higher energy, right? Because the molecule goes from a lower to a higher state when absorbing.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm mixing things up. The energy difference between the ground state and excited state is the energy of the absorbed photon. So if the molecule emits energy E, that's the energy of the photon emitted. But the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher, because the molecule is going up in energy when absorbing. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoting an electron from a lower energy orbital to a higher one. The energy of the photon must match the energy gap. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. But if the molecule has an extensive conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So lower energy photons (longer wavelength) are absorbed. Wait, but the conjugated system's extent affects the absorption wavelength. More conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption.

But in this problem, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emission is at 531 nm (green). But the absorption would be at a higher energy (lower wavelength) because the molecule must absorb a photon to get excited, and then emit a lower energy photon when it relaxes. Wait, no. Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher than the emitted one. Because the molecule is going from a lower energy state to a higher one (absorption), and then perhaps doesn't go all the way back, but emits a photon when it transitions to a lower state than the initial.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of complementary colors. If the dye emits green light (531 nm), then the color it absorbs would be the complementary color on the color wheel. The complementary color of green is magenta. But magenta isn't one of the options. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what color the compound would absorb—if it emits green, it must be absorbing a higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. Let's see: 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm. The absorbed wavelength would be higher energy, so shorter wavelength than that. Because the molecule emits when it relaxes, so the emission is at a longer wavelength than the absorbed (since the absorbed is higher energy). Wait, no, wait: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's at a certain wavelength. The energy of that photon is used to promote an electron, and then the molecule emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength) when it relaxes.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (531 nm), the absorbed photon must have higher energy, meaning a shorter wavelength. So what's the color corresponding to higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Let me compute the wavelength of the absorbed photon. Wait, I think I got this wrong earlier. Because the molecule's energy gap is the difference between the ground state and the excited state. When the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs = E_gap, the electron gets promoted. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon of E_emit, which is less than E_abs, possibly. Or maybe it's the same? Or perhaps the molecule emits at a lower energy because it doesn't return all the way to the ground state, maybe to an intermediate state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. That's the energy difference between the excited state and the state it's emitting from. If the molecule absorbed a photon of higher energy, then the absorption would correspond to a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

So what's the color of light with higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let me calculate the wavelength for higher energy. Suppose the absorbed photon is higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the relationship between energy and color. The visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Energy increases as wavelength decreases.

So 531 nm is green. So for higher energy than 2.3393 eV (which is 531 nm), the wavelength would be shorter than 531 nm. Let's see, what colors are shorter than 531? Blue is around 450-495 nm. Violet is around 380-450 nm. So the absorbed wavelength would be in the blue or violet range.

So the absorbed light would be either blue or violet. Let me see the options. Options are A) Red (longer wavelength), B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

If the absorbed photon is higher energy (shorter wavelength), the options would be B or C.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So it's emitting that energy, which corresponds to 531 nm, which is green. So the color emitted is green. The dye would appear as the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But the question is about the color absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the fact that the color we see is the complementary of the absorbed color. For example, if a dye absorbs blue, it reflects the complementary color, which is orange. But in this question, the dye emits green. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, not the color the dye appears as. So the dye absorbs a certain wavelength and emits another. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm, green. So the dye must have absorbed a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength) to get excited. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

Which one? Let's calculate the exact wavelength.

E = 2.3393 eV = hc/λ.

As before, λ = hc/(E). Let me compute it accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602176634e-19 C·V = 3.7447e-19 J.

So λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (3.7447e-19)

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 3.7447e-19 J:

λ ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 3.7447e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 meters → 531 nm.

So that's green. The absorbed photon's energy must be higher than this. So the wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So what's the color with a shorter wavelength than 531 nm? Blue is about 450-495 nm, violet is 380-450 nm. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But wait, the question is asking what color is absorbed. The dye emits green, so it must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet) to get excited.

The options are B) Violet, C) Blue.

Which one is it? Without exact calculation, it's hard to say. But let's think about the energy. 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted photon. The absorbed photon must have higher energy.

Energy is E = 1240 / λ (in nm) eV.

So, 2.3393 eV is 531 nm. So, for a higher energy, let's say the absorbed photon is at, say, 450 nm (blue), which would be E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV. So that's higher than 2.3393 eV.

That would mean the absorbed photon is blue. Alternatively, if it's violet at 400 nm, E = 3.1 eV, which is much higher.

But how does the conjugated system affect the absorption wavelength? Extensive conjugation leads to a smaller energy gap (because the electrons are more delocalized), so the absorption occurs at longer wavelengths (lower energy). Wait, no: wait, conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so the absorption moves to longer wavelengths. So a molecule with an extensively conjugated system would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO decreases with more conjugation. So lower energy is needed for the transition. Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (since E = hc/λ → lower E → longer λ).

So if the molecule has an extensive conjugated system, it would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. But in this problem, the emitted light is 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted one.

Wait, no, because the molecule emits when it relaxes. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. Because the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon to get into an excited state, and then emits a lower energy photon when it relaxes.

So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm), the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So let's say the absorbed photon is, for example, blue (450 nm, ~2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the options are violet or blue.

But the problem states that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system. So the energy gap is smaller, meaning the absorption occurs at longer wavelengths. Wait, but that would suggest that the absorbed photon is lower energy, which contradicts the earlier conclusion.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

If the molecule has a large conjugated system, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So the absorption maximum would be in the longer wavelength (red, orange, yellow, green) region.

Wait, but that's not matching with the earlier logic. If the molecule emits green (531 nm), which is lower energy than blue or violet, but if the molecule absorbed green, then it would emit something else. Or maybe I'm getting this all wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should correct my approach. The molecule can't absorb a lower energy photon than the one it emits. Because the absorption is what excites it. So if the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm, that's the energy it emits when it relaxes. So the energy gap must be equal to that, or perhaps higher.

Wait, let me clarify. The energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) must equal the energy gap (E_gap), because when the photon is absorbed, the electron is promoted from the HOMO to the LUMO, which requires exactly E_gap energy.

Then, when the electron relaxes, it doesn't necessarily go all the way back to the ground state. It might drop to an intermediate state, emitting a photon of energy E_emit = E_gap - E_relaxation (where E_relaxation is the energy of the intermediate state minus the ground state).

Alternatively, maybe the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which is the energy of the HOMO-LUMO gap, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_abs. So E_abs = E_emit + E_loss (the energy lost as heat or in another transition).

So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 531 nm.

So the absorbed color would be either blue (450-495 nm) or violet (380-450 nm).

But wait, the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, which usually absorbs in the visible range, like in the blue or green. Oh wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to bathochromic shift (longer wavelength) absorption. So the absorption would be at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the molecule emits at 531 nm (green), the absorption might be in the blue or even green range.

Wait, but that would mean the absorbed photon is lower in energy than the emitted photon, which can't be because the absorbed photon must supply the energy for the transition.

This is getting a bit confusing. Another approach: perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy emitted. No, that can't be right because the molecule wouldn't gain any energy. It must absorb a higher energy photon and emit a lower energy one.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The molecule absorbs a lower energy photon and emits a higher energy one. No, that doesn't make sense because the photon provides the energy for the transition. The molecule can't emit more energy than it absorbed unless it's gaining energy from somewhere else, which isn't the case.

So, the correct conclusion is that the absorbed photon has higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon. So with the emitted photon at 531 nm (green), the absorbed must be either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are B) Violet or C) Blue.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon is 531 nm. The absorbed photon is shorter than that, so higher energy. So which option is correct?

Let me think about the possible colors. Violet is 400-440, blue 450-495. So 531 is green, the absorption must have been in the blue or violet.

But how does the conjugated system affect this? Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption.

Wait, if the molecule has a large conjugated system, it absorbs at a longer wavelength. So if the emitted photon is 531 nm (green), the absorbed photon would be in the longer wavelength (lower energy) than that. But that can't be because the emitted photon is lower energy than the absorbed.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. Let me think again.

The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which causes an electron to jump from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of that photon is exactly E_abs = E_gap (HOMO-LUMO gap). Then, when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_gap. So E_abs = E_emit + energy lost (as heat or other transitions).

So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, E_abs must be greater than that.

Thus, the absorbed photon has a higher energy than the emitted one, so shorter wavelength.

So 531 nm is green. The absorbed photon is shorter, so in the blue or violet.

But the molecule has extensive conjugation. So it absorbs at a longer wavelength. Wait, that would mean the conjugated system makes the absorption at a longer wavelength than without conjugation. So if the molecule has a larger conjugated system, it would absorb at a longer wavelength (lower energy), which would be a lower energy photon.

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted.

I think I need to re-express this.

The HOMO-LUMO gap (E_gap) determines the energy of the absorbed photon. The molecule emits a photon whose energy is less than E_gap. So E_emit = E_gap - E_loss, where E_loss is the energy lost as heat or in other transitions.

So, E_abs = E_gap = E_emit + E_loss.

Thus, E_abs must be greater than E_emit.

So, if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, E_abs must be higher.

But if the molecule's E_gap is smaller (due to extensive conjugation), then E_abs would be smaller.

Wait, that would mean that if the conjugated system is more extensive, the E_gap is smaller, so E_abs is smaller than before. So if the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, the E_abs would be higher than that, but if the conjugated system is extensive, E_gap is small, so E_abs is lower than expected.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me try to structure it.

1. The molecule has an extensive conjugated pi system, leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap (lower E_gap).

2. The energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) equals E_gap.

3. The energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is less than E_abs.

So, if E_abs is smaller than it would be without conjugation, that means E_emit is even smaller.

Wait, but the problem says E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So if E_abs is E_emit plus some E_loss, and E_abs is smaller than without conjugation, but it's unclear. Perhaps this is a dead end.

Let me try to think of an example. Suppose a molecule absorbs blue light (450 nm, E_abs ≈ 2.75 eV). It emits green light (531 nm, E_emit ≈ 2.34 eV). So the E_abs is higher than E_emit, which fits. So the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

In this case, the absorbed color is blue, which is option C.

But wait, the molecule's extensive conjugation would lead to a smaller E_gap, so E_abs would be lower (longer wavelength). But in this case, the E_abs is 2.75 eV (blue), which is higher than E_emit. So the conjugation would actually cause the E_abs to be lower than 2.75 eV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's E_gap is lower, so E_abs is lower, meaning the absorbed photon is at a longer wavelength than 531 nm (green). But that can't be because E_abs must be higher than E_emit.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should just stick to the initial approach.

The E_emit is 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green). The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so shorter wavelength. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one is correct? Well, 531 nm is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. If the molecule emits green, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon. Let's say the absorption is in the blue region (450 nm, 2.75 eV). So the absorbed color is blue. So the answer would be C) Blue.

But wait, the conjugated system implies that the absorption is in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region. So if the molecule emits green, the absorption must be in the red, but that doesn't fit because E_abs must be higher than E_emit.

I'm getting myself tied in knots here. Perhaps the correct way is to determine the wavelength of the emitted photon, which is 531 nm (green). The color absorbed would be the one with higher energy, which is blue or violet.

But considering the conjugated system, which suggests that the absorption is at a longer wavelength, but that would be lower energy than green. Which contradicts.

Wait, maybe the conjugated system leads to emission in the green, so the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking which color is absorbed, given the energy of the emitted photon. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy. So 531 nm is green. The absorbed photon is higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Looking at the options, blue and violet are the only higher energy options (since red is lower than green).

But which one? Let's compute the exact wavelengths.

E = hc/λ.

We can compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV as 531 nm. So to find the absorbed wavelength, we need to find a higher energy (shorter λ).

Wait, but without knowing the exact E_abs, it's hard to tell. But perhaps the question expects us to know that green emission implies the absorption is in the blue or violet, and the options are B and C.

But how to choose between B and C.

Wait, I think I remember that dyes with extended conjugation, like in the case of some pigments, absorb in the blue region and emit in the yellow or red. Or wait, maybe not. Another way: the complementary color. If the dye emits green, the color we see is green; but the absorbed color is the complement of green, which is magenta. But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the absorbed color is blue or violet.

Wait, the complement of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps the absorbed color is blue, and the emitted is green. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm, green. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed color is blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact E_abs, perhaps the question is expecting us to compute the wavelength and see which color it is, to determine the absorbed color.

Wait, no, the question is about the color absorbed. The emitted color is given, but the absorption is what we need to find.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so the wavelength is shorter.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But which one is more likely? Let me compute the energy for blue and violet.

Blue: around 450 nm → E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet: around 400 nm → E = 3.1 eV.

So 2.3393 eV is between the two. But the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, which is lower than both. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So 2.3393 eV is the emitted energy, so the absorbed is higher, so either blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

But the molecule's conjugated system makes the absorption at a longer wavelength, which would imply lower energy. But that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than necessary. The question provides the energy of the emitted photon, and asks what color is absorbed. The answer is the color of the absorbed photon, which is higher energy than the emitted.

So 2.3393 eV is green. The absorbed color is either blue or violet. The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which is it? Well, without more info, perhaps the question expects us to know that the emission is in the green, which is in the middle. The absorption is typically in the blue or violet for such dyes.

Alternatively, think about the fact that when a molecule emits green, it likely absorbed blue. Because blue absorption would leave the complementary color (yellow or orange), but the dye appears green.

Wait, no. The color we see is the color not absorbed. If the dye absorbs blue, it reflects the complementary color, which is orange. But the problem states that the emitted light is green.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the energy of the absorbed photon.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the energy of the absorbed photon. It gives the emitted one. So perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed photon, which is the one that's not emitted. Or perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, which is the one that causes the emission.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet range.

Between options B) Violet and C) Blue.

In the visible spectrum, the order is violet (400), blue (450), green (530), yellow (580), orange, red.

The emitted photon is 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So it's either blue or violet.

But the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye must absorb in the violet or blue region.

Which one is more likely? Well, often, dyes that emit green have absorption in the blue or violet. For example, many fluorescent dyes absorb UV or blue and emit green or yellow.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. But the options are violet or blue.

If I had to choose between B and C, perhaps blue is more common for such emissions.

Wait, but the question says the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system. So, the energy gap is smaller, which would mean the absorbed photon is of lower energy (longer wavelength). But that would imply that the absorbed photon is lower energy than the emitted, which can't be.

Wait, no. If the conjugated system is extensive, the E_gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon has lower energy (longer wavelength) than it would without conjugation.

But in our case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm). The absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). So if the conjugated system causes the E_gap to be smaller, the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than without conjugation, but it's still higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, that's a bit of a paradox. Let me try to think numerically.

Without conjugation, E_gap might be higher, say 3 eV (413 nm, violet). But with extensive conjugation, E_gap is lower, say 2.5 eV (496 nm, blue). So in this case, the absorbed photon is at 496 nm (blue), which is higher than the emitted 531 nm (green). So the absorbed is blue.

This would make sense because the molecule's extensive conjugation causes the absorption to shift to longer wavelengths (lower energy) compared to a non-conjugated system. So the E_abs is 2.5 eV, which is longer than the emitted 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but 2.5 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorption is at 496 nm (blue), which is higher energy than 531 nm (green).

This would fit the scenario where the molecule emits green because it absorbed blue.

So the absorbed color is blue, option C.

Therefore, the answer would be C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. Using the relationship between energy and wavelength, \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:

1. Convert the energy from eV to joules:  
   \[
   E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 3.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. Solve for the wavelength using \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{3.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} = 5.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 531 \, \text{nm}.
   \]

The emitted light corresponds to a wavelength of 531 nm, which is in the green region of the visible spectrum.

Next, we consider the energy of the absorbed light. The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO. The energy of the absorbed photon is related to the energy gap (\( E_{\text{gap}} \)) between these states. Since the emitted photon has energy 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength than 531 nm.

The visible spectrum ranges from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Wavelengths shorter than 531 nm correspond to blue (450–495 nm) and violet (380–450 nm). Therefore, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet range.

The question specifies that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation reduces the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, shifting the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy). However, since the emitted photon corresponds to 531 nm (green), the absorbed photon must still have higher energy than this emitted photon, meaning it corresponds to a shorter wavelength. Thus, the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

Given the options, blue (450–495 nm) is more likely than violet (380–450 nm) for absorption in this context, as the energy gap for blue light aligns more closely with the emitted energy of 2.3393 eV.

Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. But wait, the question is about the color that's absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. Or does it emit the complementary color? I'm a bit confused.

The dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. I think conjugated systems are related to the molecule's ability to absorb light, especially in the visible range. The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO determines the wavelength absorbed. Oh right, the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to that gap.

The energy given is 2.3393 eV. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ. So I can calculate the wavelength to find out which color it is.

Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Wait, but I need to convert eV to joules because the units have to match. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that.

So 2.3393 * 1.602 is approximately 3.745, so 3.745e-19 J. Now plug into E=hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

So λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.745e-19 J) → Let me compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 3.745e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 /3.745e-19 = approximately 5.31e-7 meters. Wait, 5.31e-7 meters is 531 nm. Because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 5.31e-7 m is 531 nm.

Wait, 531 nm is in the visible spectrum. I remember the colors: red is around 700 nm, orange ~600, yellow ~580, green ~530 (wait, that's close), blue ~450, and violet ~400. So 531 is near the green region. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. Oh, wait, if the dye emits that energy, then it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, right? Because when something is excited, it emits lower energy photons. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, actually, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited from a lower energy state (like the ground state) to a higher energy state (like the excited state). The energy gap corresponds to the absorbed photon's energy. The emitted light would be when it drops from that higher state to a lower one, perhaps not all the way back. But in this case, the question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of ~531 nm (green). But the absorbed light would have higher energy, right? Because the molecule goes from a lower to a higher state when absorbing.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm mixing things up. The energy difference between the ground state and excited state is the energy of the absorbed photon. So if the molecule emits energy E, that's the energy of the photon emitted. But the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher, because the molecule is going up in energy when absorbing. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoting an electron from a lower energy orbital to a higher one. The energy of the photon must match the energy gap. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. But if the molecule has an extensive conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So lower energy photons (longer wavelength) are absorbed. Wait, but the conjugated system's extent affects the absorption wavelength. More conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption.

But in this problem, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emission is at 531 nm (green). But the absorption would be at a higher energy (lower wavelength) because the molecule must absorb a photon to get excited, and then emit a lower energy photon when it relaxes. Wait, no. Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher than the emitted one. Because the molecule is going from a lower energy state to a higher one (absorption), and then perhaps doesn't go all the way back, but emits a photon when it transitions to a lower state than the initial.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of complementary colors. If the dye emits green light (531 nm), then the color it absorbs would be the complementary color on the color wheel. The complementary color of green is magenta. But magenta isn't one of the options. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what color the compound would absorb—if it emits green, it must be absorbing a higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. Let's see: 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm. The absorbed wavelength would be higher energy, so shorter wavelength than that. Because the molecule emits when it relaxes, so the emission is at a longer wavelength than the absorbed (since the absorbed is higher energy). Wait, no, wait: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's at a certain wavelength. The energy of that photon is used to promote an electron, and then the molecule emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength) when it relaxes.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (531 nm), the absorbed photon must have higher energy, meaning a shorter wavelength. So what's the color corresponding to higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Let me compute the wavelength of the absorbed photon. Wait, I think I got this wrong earlier. Because the molecule's energy gap is the difference between the ground state and the excited state. When the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs = E_gap, the electron gets promoted. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon of E_emit, which is less than E_abs, possibly. Or maybe it's the same? Or perhaps the molecule emits at a lower energy because it doesn't return all the way to the ground state, maybe to an intermediate state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. That's the energy difference between the excited state and the state it's emitting from. If the molecule absorbed a photon of higher energy, then the absorption would correspond to a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

So what's the color of light with higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let me calculate the wavelength for higher energy. Suppose the absorbed photon is higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the relationship between energy and color. The visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Energy increases as wavelength decreases.

So 531 nm is green. So for higher energy than 2.3393 eV (which is 531 nm), the wavelength would be shorter than 531 nm. Let's see, what colors are shorter than 531? Blue is around 450-495 nm. Violet is around 380-450 nm. So the absorbed wavelength would be in the blue or violet range.

So the absorbed light would be either blue or violet. Let me see the options. Options are A) Red (longer wavelength), B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

If the absorbed photon is higher energy (shorter wavelength), the options would be B or C.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So it's emitting that energy, which corresponds to 531 nm, which is green. So the color emitted is green. The dye would appear as the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But the question is about the color absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the fact that the color we see is the complementary of the absorbed color. For example, if a dye absorbs blue, it reflects the complementary color, which is orange. But in this question, the dye emits green. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, not the color the dye appears as. So the dye absorbs a certain wavelength and emits another. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm, green. So the dye must have absorbed a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength) to get excited. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

Which one? Let's calculate the exact wavelength.

E = 2.3393 eV = hc/λ.

As before, λ = hc/(E). Let me compute it accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602176634e-19 C·V = 3.7447e-19 J.

So λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (3.7447e-19)

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 3.7447e-19 J:

λ ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 3.7447e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 meters → 531 nm.

So that's green. The absorbed photon's energy must be higher than this. So the wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So what's the color with a shorter wavelength than 531 nm? Blue is about 450-495 nm, violet is 380-450 nm. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But wait, the question is asking what color is absorbed. The dye emits green, so it must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet) to get excited.

The options are B) Violet, C) Blue.

Which one is it? Without exact calculation, it's hard to say. But let's think about the energy. 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted photon. The absorbed photon must have higher energy.

Energy is E = 1240 / λ (in nm) eV.

So, 2.3393 eV is 531 nm. So, for a higher energy, let's say the absorbed photon is at, say, 450 nm (blue), which would be E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV. So that's higher than 2.3393 eV.

That would mean the absorbed photon is blue. Alternatively, if it's violet at 400 nm, E = 3.1 eV, which is much higher.

But how does the conjugated system affect the absorption wavelength? Extensive conjugation leads to a smaller energy gap (because the electrons are more delocalized), so the absorption occurs at longer wavelengths (lower energy). Wait, no: wait, conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so the absorption moves to longer wavelengths. So a molecule with an extensively conjugated system would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO decreases with more conjugation. So lower energy is needed for the transition. Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (since E = hc/λ → lower E → longer λ).

So if the molecule has an extensive conjugated system, it would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. But in this problem, the emitted light is 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted one.

Wait, no, because the molecule emits when it relaxes. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. Because the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon to get into an excited state, and then emits a lower energy photon when it relaxes.

So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm), the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So let's say the absorbed photon is, for example, blue (450 nm, ~2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the options are violet or blue.

But the problem states that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system. So the energy gap is smaller, meaning the absorption occurs at longer wavelengths. Wait, but that would suggest that the absorbed photon is lower energy, which contradicts the earlier conclusion.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

If the molecule has a large conjugated system, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So the absorption maximum would be in the longer wavelength (red, orange, yellow, green) region.

Wait, but that's not matching with the earlier logic. If the molecule emits green (531 nm), which is lower energy than blue or violet, but if the molecule absorbed green, then it would emit something else. Or maybe I'm getting this all wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should correct my approach. The molecule can't absorb a lower energy photon than the one it emits. Because the absorption is what excites it. So if the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm, that's the energy it emits when it relaxes. So the energy gap must be equal to that, or perhaps higher.

Wait, let me clarify. The energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) must equal the energy gap (E_gap), because when the photon is absorbed, the electron is promoted from the HOMO to the LUMO, which requires exactly E_gap energy.

Then, when the electron relaxes, it doesn't necessarily go all the way back to the ground state. It might drop to an intermediate state, emitting a photon of energy E_emit = E_gap - E_relaxation (where E_relaxation is the energy of the intermediate state minus the ground state).

Alternatively, maybe the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which is the energy of the HOMO-LUMO gap, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_abs. So E_abs = E_emit + E_loss (the energy lost as heat or in another transition).

So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 531 nm.

So the absorbed color would be either blue (450-495 nm) or violet (380-450 nm).

But wait, the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, which usually absorbs in the visible range, like in the blue or green. Oh wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to bathochromic shift (longer wavelength) absorption. So the absorption would be at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the molecule emits at 531 nm (green), the absorption might be in the blue or even green range.

Wait, but that would mean the absorbed photon is lower in energy than the emitted photon, which can't be because the absorbed photon must supply the energy for the transition.

This is getting a bit confusing. Another approach: perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy emitted. No, that can't be right because the molecule wouldn't gain any energy. It must absorb a higher energy photon and emit a lower energy one.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The molecule absorbs a lower energy photon and emits a higher energy one. No, that doesn't make sense because the photon provides the energy for the transition. The molecule can't emit more energy than it absorbed unless it's gaining energy from somewhere else, which isn't the case.

So, the correct conclusion is that the absorbed photon has higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon. So with the emitted photon at 531 nm (green), the absorbed must be either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are B) Violet or C) Blue.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon is 531 nm. The absorbed photon is shorter than that, so higher energy. So which option is correct?

Let me think about the possible colors. Violet is 400-440, blue 450-495. So 531 is green, the absorption must have been in the blue or violet.

But how does the conjugated system affect this? Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption.

Wait, if the molecule has a large conjugated system, it absorbs at a longer wavelength. So if the emitted photon is 531 nm (green), the absorbed photon would be in the longer wavelength (lower energy) than that. But that can't be because the emitted photon is lower energy than the absorbed.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. Let me think again.

The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which causes an electron to jump from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of that photon is exactly E_abs = E_gap (HOMO-LUMO gap). Then, when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_gap. So E_abs = E_emit + energy lost (as heat or other transitions).

So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, E_abs must be greater than that.

Thus, the absorbed photon has a higher energy than the emitted one, so shorter wavelength.

So 531 nm is green. The absorbed photon is shorter, so in the blue or violet.

But the molecule has extensive conjugation. So it absorbs at a longer wavelength. Wait, that would mean the conjugated system makes the absorption at a longer wavelength than without conjugation. So if the molecule has a larger conjugated system, it would absorb at a longer wavelength (lower energy), which would be a lower energy photon.

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted.

I think I need to re-express this.

The HOMO-LUMO gap (E_gap) determines the energy of the absorbed photon. The molecule emits a photon whose energy is less than E_gap. So E_emit = E_gap - E_loss, where E_loss is the energy lost as heat or in other transitions.

So, E_abs = E_gap = E_emit + E_loss.

Thus, E_abs must be greater than E_emit.

So, if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, E_abs must be higher.

But if the molecule's E_gap is smaller (due to extensive conjugation), then E_abs would be smaller.

Wait, that would mean that if the conjugated system is more extensive, the E_gap is smaller, so E_abs is smaller than before. So if the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, the E_abs would be higher than that, but if the conjugated system is extensive, E_gap is small, so E_abs is lower than expected.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me try to structure it.

1. The molecule has an extensive conjugated pi system, leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap (lower E_gap).

2. The energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) equals E_gap.

3. The energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is less than E_abs.

So, if E_abs is smaller than it would be without conjugation, that means E_emit is even smaller.

Wait, but the problem says E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So if E_abs is E_emit plus some E_loss, and E_abs is smaller than without conjugation, but it's unclear. Perhaps this is a dead end.

Let me try to think of an example. Suppose a molecule absorbs blue light (450 nm, E_abs ≈ 2.75 eV). It emits green light (531 nm, E_emit ≈ 2.34 eV). So the E_abs is higher than E_emit, which fits. So the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

In this case, the absorbed color is blue, which is option C.

But wait, the molecule's extensive conjugation would lead to a smaller E_gap, so E_abs would be lower (longer wavelength). But in this case, the E_abs is 2.75 eV (blue), which is higher than E_emit. So the conjugation would actually cause the E_abs to be lower than 2.75 eV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's E_gap is lower, so E_abs is lower, meaning the absorbed photon is at a longer wavelength than 531 nm (green). But that can't be because E_abs must be higher than E_emit.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should just stick to the initial approach.

The E_emit is 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green). The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so shorter wavelength. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one is correct? Well, 531 nm is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. If the molecule emits green, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon. Let's say the absorption is in the blue region (450 nm, 2.75 eV). So the absorbed color is blue. So the answer would be C) Blue.

But wait, the conjugated system implies that the absorption is in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region. So if the molecule emits green, the absorption must be in the red, but that doesn't fit because E_abs must be higher than E_emit.

I'm getting myself tied in knots here. Perhaps the correct way is to determine the wavelength of the emitted photon, which is 531 nm (green). The color absorbed would be the one with higher energy, which is blue or violet.

But considering the conjugated system, which suggests that the absorption is at a longer wavelength, but that would be lower energy than green. Which contradicts.

Wait, maybe the conjugated system leads to emission in the green, so the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking which color is absorbed, given the energy of the emitted photon. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy. So 531 nm is green. The absorbed photon is higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Looking at the options, blue and violet are the only higher energy options (since red is lower than green).

But which one? Let's compute the exact wavelengths.

E = hc/λ.

We can compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV as 531 nm. So to find the absorbed wavelength, we need to find a higher energy (shorter λ).

Wait, but without knowing the exact E_abs, it's hard to tell. But perhaps the question expects us to know that green emission implies the absorption is in the blue or violet, and the options are B and C.

But how to choose between B and C.

Wait, I think I remember that dyes with extended conjugation, like in the case of some pigments, absorb in the blue region and emit in the yellow or red. Or wait, maybe not. Another way: the complementary color. If the dye emits green, the color we see is green; but the absorbed color is the complement of green, which is magenta. But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the absorbed color is blue or violet.

Wait, the complement of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps the absorbed color is blue, and the emitted is green. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm, green. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed color is blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact E_abs, perhaps the question is expecting us to compute the wavelength and see which color it is, to determine the absorbed color.

Wait, no, the question is about the color absorbed. The emitted color is given, but the absorption is what we need to find.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so the wavelength is shorter.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But which one is more likely? Let me compute the energy for blue and violet.

Blue: around 450 nm → E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet: around 400 nm → E = 3.1 eV.

So 2.3393 eV is between the two. But the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, which is lower than both. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So 2.3393 eV is the emitted energy, so the absorbed is higher, so either blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

But the molecule's conjugated system makes the absorption at a longer wavelength, which would imply lower energy. But that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than necessary. The question provides the energy of the emitted photon, and asks what color is absorbed. The answer is the color of the absorbed photon, which is higher energy than the emitted.

So 2.3393 eV is green. The absorbed color is either blue or violet. The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which is it? Well, without more info, perhaps the question expects us to know that the emission is in the green, which is in the middle. The absorption is typically in the blue or violet for such dyes.

Alternatively, think about the fact that when a molecule emits green, it likely absorbed blue. Because blue absorption would leave the complementary color (yellow or orange), but the dye appears green.

Wait, no. The color we see is the color not absorbed. If the dye absorbs blue, it reflects the complementary color, which is orange. But the problem states that the emitted light is green.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the energy of the absorbed photon.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the energy of the absorbed photon. It gives the emitted one. So perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed photon, which is the one that's not emitted. Or perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, which is the one that causes the emission.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet range.

Between options B) Violet and C) Blue.

In the visible spectrum, the order is violet (400), blue (450), green (530), yellow (580), orange, red.

The emitted photon is 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So it's either blue or violet.

But the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye must absorb in the violet or blue region.

Which one is more likely? Well, often, dyes that emit green have absorption in the blue or violet. For example, many fluorescent dyes absorb UV or blue and emit green or yellow.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. But the options are violet or blue.

If I had to choose between B and C, perhaps blue is more common for such emissions.

Wait, but the question says the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system. So, the energy gap is smaller, which would mean the absorbed photon is of lower energy (longer wavelength). But that would imply that the absorbed photon is lower energy than the emitted, which can't be.

Wait, no. If the conjugated system is extensive, the E_gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon has lower energy (longer wavelength) than it would without conjugation.

But in our case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm). The absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). So if the conjugated system causes the E_gap to be smaller, the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than without conjugation, but it's still higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, that's a bit of a paradox. Let me try to think numerically.

Without conjugation, E_gap might be higher, say 3 eV (413 nm, violet). But with extensive conjugation, E_gap is lower, say 2.5 eV (496 nm, blue). So in this case, the absorbed photon is at 496 nm (blue), which is higher than the emitted 531 nm (green). So the absorbed is blue.

This would make sense because the molecule's extensive conjugation causes the absorption to shift to longer wavelengths (lower energy) compared to a non-conjugated system. So the E_abs is 2.5 eV, which is longer than the emitted 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but 2.5 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorption is at 496 nm (blue), which is higher energy than 531 nm (green).

This would fit the scenario where the molecule emits green because it absorbed blue.

So the absorbed color is blue, option C.

Therefore, the answer would be C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. Using the relationship between energy and wavelength, \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:

1. Convert the energy from eV to joules:  
   \[
   E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 3.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. Solve for the wavelength using \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{3.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} = 5.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 531 \, \text{nm}.
   \]

The emitted light corresponds to a wavelength of 531 nm, which is in the green region of the visible spectrum.

Next, we consider the energy of the absorbed light. The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO. The energy of the absorbed photon is related to the energy gap (\( E_{\text{gap}} \)) between these states. Since the emitted photon has energy 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength than 531 nm.

The visible spectrum ranges from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Wavelengths shorter than 531 nm correspond to blue (450–495 nm) and violet (380–450 nm). Therefore, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet range.

The question specifies that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation reduces the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, shifting the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy). However, since the emitted photon corresponds to 531 nm (green), the absorbed photon must still have higher energy than this emitted photon, meaning it corresponds to a shorter wavelength. Thus, the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

Given the options, blue (450–495 nm) is more likely than violet (380–450 nm) for absorption in this context, as the energy gap for blue light aligns more closely with the emitted energy of 2.3393 eV.

**Answer: C**
