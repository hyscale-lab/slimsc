Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probability. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit from the given options. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the RV method. So, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars are interesting: the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. 

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher transit probability. So, which one is it?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula I think is something like P = (R_planet / R_star) * (a / (R_star + a)) ), but wait, maybe it's more precise. Oh right, it's actually the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but let me get it right.

Wait, the transit probability is highest when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us, and the formula for the probability (assuming random orientation) is approximately (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, no, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else). Let's think.

The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s) / (a/(R_s)) )? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the star and planet (scaled by the star's radius). Wait, no, I think the transit probability is the area of the circle where the planet can pass in front of the star divided by the area of the entire orbital plane that the planet's orbit subtends from our point of view.

Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_s + R_p) / a, but wait, since R_p is much smaller than R_s, we can approximate it as R_s / a. Wait that's not it. Let me get this right.

I think the correct formula is P = (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no. Because the orbital distance is a, and the star's radius is R_*, so the probability is approximately (R_* / a) multiplied by (something else). Hmm, maybe it's (R_* / a) times a factor considering the inclination. Oh right, if the orbit is circular and randomly oriented, the probability is (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (a/(R_*)))^0.5 )) or something. No, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait no, maybe it's more about the geometry. The probability is proportional to (R_* / a) times (R_*/a), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to recall. Oh right! The transit probability for a planet around a star is given by:

P = (R_p / R_*)^2 * (a / R_*) )^{-1} }? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P ≈ (R_* / a) * (R_* / a), but that seems off. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_* / a)² × (something). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher when the star is larger or when the planet is closer, because the chances of the planet passing in front are higher. So, if a planet is closer to its star (smaller a), the probability increases.

In this problem, both planets have the same mass, but different host stars and periods.

Wait, the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a³. Since the planets are Earth-like (so M_p << M_*), we can approximate P² = (4π²/(G M_*)) a³. So, a³ ∝ P² * M_*. 

Wait, so for each planet, a is proportional to (P² M_*)^1/3.

So, for Planet_1, period P1, and star mass M1. For Planet_2, P2, M2.

Given that P1 = P2 /3, and M1 = 2 M2.

So, a1 is proportional to ( (P1^2) * M1 )^(1/3) = ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * 2 M2 ) )^(1/3 ) 

Wait, but M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host, which is less than M1. So M1 = 2 M2.

So, substituting, a1 ~ ( ( (P2^2 /9 ) * 2 M2 ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, but the same for a2: a2 ~ ( ( P2^2 * M2 ) )^(1/3 )

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

a1^3 = ( (P2^2 /9) * 2 M2 ) = (2/9) P2^2 M2.

a2^3 = P2^2 M2.

So, a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216). So a1 is approximately 0.6 * a2.

Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2. Because a1 is smaller than a2. Because a1 is 0.6 a2.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_*/a), where R_* is the star's radius. Because, the probability is higher when a is smaller.

But both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So, P1's transit probability is proportional to R/(a1), and P2's is R/(a2).

Since a1 = 0.6 a2, R/(a1) = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/(a2)).

Which is 5/3 times more than P2's. So P1's probability is about 1.666 times higher than P2's. 

Wait, so transit probability for Planet_1 is 5/3 times that of Planet_2. So, 1.666..., which is approximately 1.65.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability.

So looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is much higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check.

Wait, the transit probability formula. I think I might have gotten it wrong earlier. Let me re-derive it.

The transit probability is the area of the circle (on the sky) where the planet can transit, divided by the total area of possible positions. Alternatively, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (in the plane of the sky), scaled by the eccentricity (but since orbits are circular, e=0).

Wait, the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a.

But since R_p << R_*, this is approximately R_* / a.

So, the probability is proportional to R_*/a.

Both stars have the same R_*, so P1's probability is (R/a1), P2's is (R/a2).

From earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) (R/a2) = 1.666... times higher than P2's probability.

So, P1's probability is about 1.666 times that of P2.

Thus, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, so they should observe Planet_1.

Looking back at the options, option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability." Since 1.666 is approximately 1.65, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which planet has a higher transit probability, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability for a planet is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars differ.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and a host star mass \( M_{1} = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 \) and a host star mass \( M_2 \).

The semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( \left(\frac{P^2 M_*}{1}\right)^{1/3} \). Substituting the values:
\[
a_1 \propto \left(\frac{P_1^2 M_1}{1}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2}{1}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2P_2^2 M_2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]
\[
a_2 \propto \left(\frac{P_2^2 M_2}{1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]
Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius \( R_* \), the probability is inversely proportional to \( a \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Given that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing it. Among the options, the correct one is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**

Wait, but M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host, which is less than M1. So M1 = 2 M2.

So, substituting, a1 ~ ( ( (P2^2 /9 ) * 2 M2 ) )^(1/3 )

a2^3 = P2^2 M2.

So, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216). So a1 is approximately 0.6 * a2.

To determine which planet has a higher transit probability, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability for a planet is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars differ.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and a host star mass \( M_{1} = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 \) and a host star mass \( M_2 \).

The semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( \left(\frac{P^2 M_*}{1}\right)^{1/3} \). Substituting the values:
\[
a_1 \propto \left(\frac{P_1^2 M_1}{1}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2}{1}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2P_2^2 M_2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]
\[
a_2 \propto \left(\frac{P_2^2 M_2}{1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]
Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius \( R_* \), the probability is inversely proportional to \( a \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Given that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing it. Among the options, the correct one is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
