Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. 

Wait, what's the concentration after dilution? I think I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L (20 cm³). V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 is (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh right, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So acetic acid is now 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Hmm. Let's tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present initially.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 0.04 L, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 * 0.025 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. Let's find the volume needed to reach equivalence. Moles NaOH = 0.001. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem says at 25% titration. So that would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So for 25% titration, we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Now, let's think about the 25% point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

Initially, we had 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. So remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And we have 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

The total volume at this point is 20 + 20 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85)≈0.267, so log(1.85e-5)=0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

Now [A^-] is about 0.005882 M and [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. Because 0.005882 is 1/3 of 0.017646 (since 1/3 is 0.333).

So log(0.3333) is approx -0.477. 

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. 

Looking at the options, the first part of option A is 4.26, which matches. But let me check for calculation errors.

Wait, could I have messed up the moles? Let me double-check.

Initial moles of acetic acid: volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. So 0.04 * 0.025 = 0.001 moles. That's correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So moles NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

So, correct. The buffer concentrations are as I found. Henderson equation gives pH≈4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

Wait, but when you have a weak acid reacting with a strong base, at equivalence point you get the conjugate base in solution, which will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So, the solution at equivalence point will consist of the acetate ions dissolved in water. The concentration of acetate can be calculated.

Total volume at equivalence is 20 + 20 +10 = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. It will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, set up the expression for Kb. Let's denote [OH^-] as x.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So equation becomes x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.516, so pOH is 5.484.

So pH = 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516. 

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. That's close.

Wait, but some sources say that when you have a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So my calculation here for the equivalence point should be correct.

Wait, but another approach: maybe consider that the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

So the acetate ion concentration is indeed 0.02 M, as I found.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, but at equivalence, HA is all converted to A^-, so [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero. But wait, that would give pH = pKa + log( (0.02)/0 ), which is undefined. But in reality, at equivalence, all HA is converted to A^-, but A^- can hydrolyze to produce a little HA and OH^-.

Hmm. So I think my earlier approach using Kb is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb of acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, the concentration of OH^- is sqrt(Kb * C), where C is 0.02 M. So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So pOH is about 5.484, pH = 8.516.

Which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. So why is their pH at equivalence lower than 7? That can't be right because a strong base titrated into a weak acid should result in a basic solution at equivalence.

So option A and option D are the possible ones. Wait, let me reconsider the first part.

Wait, when I calculated the pH at 25% titration, I got approximately 4.26, which matches option A (4.26; 8.52). Option D has 4.57 as the first value, which is higher than 4.26. So why is that? Did I make a mistake in the buffer calculation?

Let me re-examine the buffer calculation.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So, the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001, and moles of NaOH added is 0.00025. So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.00075; moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total solution volume is 20 +20 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256 ≈4.26.

So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the dilution was done incorrectly. Let me think: original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water. So total volume 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Correct.

So I think the initial calculation is correct, so option A's pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Another possibility: maybe I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps when the solution is at equivalence, it's not just the acetate hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, let me think again. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the concentration is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me compute the pH again.

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is about 5.484, so pH is 14-5.484=8.516, which is approximately 8.52.

So that's correct. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

So the first part is 4.26 and the second is 8.52, matching option A.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the initial dilution of acetic acid, and the subsequent titration. So the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when you titrate, the initial pH is that of a weak acid solution. But the question isn't asking about initial pH; it's about pH at 25% and equivalence.

Wait, but another mistake: perhaps I should have considered the dilution when calculating the moles of NaOH at equivalence.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, as done earlier.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

So everything looks correct. So I think option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid
We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of Acetic Acid
The total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.04 \times 0.025 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH (25%)}} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 20 + 20 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Step 5: pH at Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 20 + 20 + 10 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match option **A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. 

Wait, what's the concentration after dilution? I think I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L (20 cm³). V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 is (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh right, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So acetic acid is now 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Hmm. Let's tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present initially.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 0.04 L, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 * 0.025 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. Let's find the volume needed to reach equivalence. Moles NaOH = 0.001. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem says at 25% titration. So that would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So for 25% titration, we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Now, let's think about the 25% point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

Initially, we had 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. So remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And we have 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

The total volume at this point is 20 + 20 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85)≈0.267, so log(1.85e-5)=0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

Now [A^-] is about 0.005882 M and [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. Because 0.005882 is 1/3 of 0.017646 (since 1/3 is 0.333).

So log(0.3333) is approx -0.477. 

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. 

Looking at the options, the first part of option A is 4.26, which matches. But let me check for calculation errors.

Wait, could I have messed up the moles? Let me double-check.

Initial moles of acetic acid: volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. So 0.04 * 0.025 = 0.001 moles. That's correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So moles NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

So, correct. The buffer concentrations are as I found. Henderson equation gives pH≈4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

Wait, but when you have a weak acid reacting with a strong base, at equivalence point you get the conjugate base in solution, which will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So, the solution at equivalence point will consist of the acetate ions dissolved in water. The concentration of acetate can be calculated.

Total volume at equivalence is 20 + 20 +10 = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. It will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, set up the expression for Kb. Let's denote [OH^-] as x.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So equation becomes x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.516, so pOH is 5.484.

So pH = 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516. 

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. That's close.

Wait, but some sources say that when you have a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So my calculation here for the equivalence point should be correct.

Wait, but another approach: maybe consider that the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

So the acetate ion concentration is indeed 0.02 M, as I found.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, but at equivalence, HA is all converted to A^-, so [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero. But wait, that would give pH = pKa + log( (0.02)/0 ), which is undefined. But in reality, at equivalence, all HA is converted to A^-, but A^- can hydrolyze to produce a little HA and OH^-.

Hmm. So I think my earlier approach using Kb is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb of acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, the concentration of OH^- is sqrt(Kb * C), where C is 0.02 M. So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So pOH is about 5.484, pH = 8.516.

Which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. So why is their pH at equivalence lower than 7? That can't be right because a strong base titrated into a weak acid should result in a basic solution at equivalence.

So option A and option D are the possible ones. Wait, let me reconsider the first part.

Wait, when I calculated the pH at 25% titration, I got approximately 4.26, which matches option A (4.26; 8.52). Option D has 4.57 as the first value, which is higher than 4.26. So why is that? Did I make a mistake in the buffer calculation?

Let me re-examine the buffer calculation.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So, the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001, and moles of NaOH added is 0.00025. So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.00075; moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total solution volume is 20 +20 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256 ≈4.26.

So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the dilution was done incorrectly. Let me think: original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water. So total volume 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Correct.

So I think the initial calculation is correct, so option A's pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Another possibility: maybe I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps when the solution is at equivalence, it's not just the acetate hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, let me think again. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the concentration is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me compute the pH again.

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is about 5.484, so pH is 14-5.484=8.516, which is approximately 8.52.

So that's correct. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

So the first part is 4.26 and the second is 8.52, matching option A.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the initial dilution of acetic acid, and the subsequent titration. So the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when you titrate, the initial pH is that of a weak acid solution. But the question isn't asking about initial pH; it's about pH at 25% and equivalence.

Wait, but another mistake: perhaps I should have considered the dilution when calculating the moles of NaOH at equivalence.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, as done earlier.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

So everything looks correct. So I think option A is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid
We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of Acetic Acid
The total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.04 \times 0.025 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH (25%)}} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 20 + 20 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Step 5: pH at Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 20 + 20 + 10 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match option **A**.
