Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options given. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to find out what A and B are.

So, let me break this down. Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting it with NaCN. I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide usually undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile group like CN-, it's likely an addition reaction. So, the ketone would add the cyanide to the carbonyl carbon. Then, after that, perhaps some kind of elimination or another step.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. So, the molecule would have a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that also has two methyl groups and a hydroxyl group, right? So, the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile at the end. So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2? Or perhaps it's CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but the important part is that the product has a hydroxyl group, a methyl, and a nitrile on the same carbon.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, under certain conditions, it should add the CN- to the carbonyl carbon. So, the product would be (CH3)2C-O-CN? No, wait. Wait, the addition of CN- to ketones typically gives a cyanohydrin. So, the product is a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin.

But wait, to form the cyanohydrin, the reaction is usually done in a basic or acidic condition. Because the carbonyl needs to be activated. I think the reaction is done under acidic conditions. So, after adding H+ to the carbonyl oxygen, the CN- can attack.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- and a weak base, but in the presence of an acid, maybe we can protonate the carbonyl. So, the reagent A, which is used with NaCN, is probably an acid. Looking at the options, in option A and B, A is H3O+. So, H3O+ as a catalyst.

Wait, but wait, what about the second reaction? The second part involves 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (or the substituted version) reacting with H2O and reagent B. The product is a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions involve either strong acid or strong base. But in this case, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, maybe it's an intramolecular reaction, but not sure.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile (CN) is being converted into a COOH group.

So, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under acidic conditions, typically with H2O and a strong acid like HCl. Alternatively, under basic conditions with H2O and then acid workup.

Wait, but the reaction here is using H2O as a reactant. So, the reagent B is probably an acid. Because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is the result of hydrolysis.

So, for the first reaction, reagent A is likely an acid catalyst, like H3O+. So, in the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, but wait, for the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. So, the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. The typical condition for making cyanohydrins is using an acid catalyst, like HCl or H2SO4. But in the options, the A reagent is either H3O+ (which is a source of H+ ions, like from HCl) or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, no, NaHSO3 is disodium hydrogen sulfite? Or wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is NaHSO4. Wait, no, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, but more precisely, I might be mixing this up. Wait, HSO3^- is the bisulfite ion. So, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite.

Wait, but in the context of the first reaction, when adding CN- to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin, the conditions are typically acidic. So, the presence of an acid like H3O+ (from HCl, for example) would make sense. So, reagent A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So, if the first reaction requires an acid catalyst, then A would be H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The reagent B is given as H2O. Wait, no, the question says the reagent is B and H2O is part of the reaction. So, the reaction is with H2O and reagent B. So, the question says, "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". So, B is the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction.

So, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids are strong acid or strong base followed by acid workup.

If B is an acid, like HCl, then the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions. Alternatively, if B is a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH), would that work?

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So, the reaction is probably done under acidic conditions. For nitrile hydrolysis, using H2O and HCl (a strong acid) as the reagent would make sense. So, in the options, B could be HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D). 

Wait, but wait, in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, would that position affect the reaction?

Wait, perhaps it's an example of hydrolysis where the nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid. For that, the typical reagents are H2O with a strong acid (like HCl) as the catalyst. So, reagent B would be HCl.

So, if the first reaction's reagent A is H3O+ (so A is either option A or B), and the second reagent B is HCl (so options A or C).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → this fits.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. But if A is NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^- (bisulfite), but for the first reaction, I thought we needed an acid catalyst. So, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, but NaHSO3 is a moderately strong acid (HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+). Hmm.

Wait, but the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN and reagent A. So, NaCN is a salt that dissociates into Na+ and CN^-. So, the solution is basic because CN^- is a weak base. To facilitate the addition of CN^- to the ketone, you would need to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So, adding H+ from an acid catalyst would help.

So, the presence of an acid (like H3O+) would protonate the ketone, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN^-. So, reagent A is an acid, probably H3O+.

So, looking back, the first reaction uses A as H3O+. That would point to options A or B. But for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then option A is correct. Or if B is something else.

Wait, another thought: when a nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, another possibility is using a strong base like NaOH, followed by acid workup. But in this case, the reagent B is H2O, so perhaps it's an acidic hydrolysis.

So, the reagent B in the second reaction would be HCl, as in option A.

So, putting it all together: reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and reagent B is HCl (so options A or C). So, the only option where A is H3O+ and B is HCl is option A.

Wait, but looking back, I need to check the options again.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → this fits.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → B is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. Would that be enough for the hydrolysis?

I think HCl is a stronger acid and more effective for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So, option A might be correct.

Wait, but I'm a little unsure. Why would option D be a possibility? Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: what's the role of each reagent in the first and second reaction.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin.

So, ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. The conditions for this are typically acid-catalyzed. So, A is an acid. H3O+ is an acid, which would come from a strong acid like HCl. So, in the options, if A is H3O+, then options A and B have that.

Now, the second reaction: nitrile + H2O and B → carboxylic acid.

So, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed. For this, either strong acid or strong base is used. Let's think about the reagents.

If we use a strong acid, like HCl (B=HCl), then the reaction is in an acidic aqueous solution. The nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is a weak acid like CH3COOH, would that work? I think for hydrolysis, especially in the case of nitriles, a strong acid is usually required. So, HCl is more likely.

So, putting it all together, the correct reagents are A= H3O+ and B= HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again about the first reaction. Could NaHSO3 be a suitable catalyst?

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+. So, perhaps in the first reaction, it's possible that HSO3^- could act as an acid catalyst, but I'm less certain about that. Typically, for cyanohydrin formation, I think HCl is used as the acid. So, H3O+ would be from HCl, making option A correct.

Alternatively, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the catalyst, which is a weaker acid, would that still work? Maybe it can, but it's less common. I think the intended answer is option A.

So, the correct answer should be option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1: 
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one) to form a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (from HCl) is a strong acid and a suitable catalyst for this reaction. 

### Reaction 2: 
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The typical conditions for this transformation are acidic hydrolysis, often using a strong acid like HCl. A weak acid like CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is less effective for this reaction. Therefore, **HCl** is the most appropriate reagent for this step.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This fits both reactions: H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile in the second reaction.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺ and is less commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is not ideal for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.
