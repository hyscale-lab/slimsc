Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, it's about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Five of them are known. The question is about figuring out the molecular weight of substance A4.

Let me start by listing out the information given:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, like 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the degree of fluorination or maybe the formula?) for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, wait, 31.96% fluorine by mass? That number seems familiar. Fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19, so maybe that helps later.

2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

3. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, Y is being fluorinated, probably in a reaction where Y reacts with F2. So A3 is probably YF_n, maybe YF3 or something else.

4. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. So A4 is likely a solution of a compound, maybe a salt. Y is being added to it, perhaps displacing something else. The reaction gives A5, which then decomposes in water into two substances. So A5 is probably an acid, maybe because when it decomposes in water, it could form a salt and water, or maybe a gas.

Let me think about the compounds of Y and fluorine. Since there are five binary compounds, Y must be a clement that can form multiple fluorides. Let's consider elements that form several fluorides. For example, chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but I'm not sure that's relevant here. Maybe it's something else. Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, oxygen doesn't form many fluorides. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, A1 is a bright red substance. I remember that lead(II,IV) fluoride is bright red, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogen's fluoride. Wait, another thought: ClF3 is a red-brown gas, but maybe not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is something like YF4, and upon decomposition, it produces YF3 and F2? Or perhaps YF6 decomposes. Wait, but the decomposition of A1 gives fluorine, which is F2 gas.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. Suppose A1 is YF6. If it decomposes, maybe it breaks down into YF3 and fluorine. Let me write the equation: YF6 -> YF3 + F2. Let's balance that. YF6 → YF3 + F2. Let's see, on the left, we have 6 F. On the right, YF3 has 3 F, and F2 has 2 F, so 3 + 2*1 = 5 F? No, wait. Wait, for each F2 molecule, that's 2 F atoms. So if YF6 → YF3 + F2, then:

Left: 6 F → Right: 3 (YF3) + 2 (F2) → 3 + 2*2 = 7 F? No, that doesn't balance. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong decomposition.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF3. If YF3 decomposes, perhaps it produces Y and F2. Let me try: 2 YF3 → 2 Y + 3 F2. That would balance the fluorine: 6 F on the left, 6 F on the right (3*2). The Y would balance as 2 on each side. So that works. But then, when it decomposes, what is A2? In this case, A2 would be Y, maybe as a solid, and F2 gas.

But then the oF for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, if A2 is Y, what is its fluorine content? If Y is pure element, then it's 0% fluorine. So that can't be right. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is something else. Let me think about fluorine compounds that are bright red. Another thought: maybe it's lead(IV) fluoride, PbF4, which is bright yellow, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixed oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the fluorine percentage. 31.96% F by mass. So if a compound has F at 31.96%, what could that be? Let's calculate. Let's say the formula is YF_x. Then, (19x)/(atomic weight of Y + 19x) = 0.3196.

Let me denote M as the atomic weight of Y. So 19x = 0.3196 (M + 19x).

Rearranging: 19x = 0.3196 M + 0.3196 *19x → 19x (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 M → 19x * 0.6804 = 0.3196 M → M = (19x * 0.6804) / 0.3196.

Let me calculate this for different x.

For x=1: M = (19 * 0.6804)/0.3196 ≈ (12.9276)/0.3196 ≈ 40.5. Hmm, that's close to calcium's atomic weight (around 40), but Y is a different element.

x=2: M = (38 *0.6804)/0.3196 ≈ (25.8552)/0.3196 ≈ 80.8. Hmm, that's around the atomic weight of strontium (87.62), but maybe it could be another element.

x=3: (57 * 0.6804)/0.3196 → (38.7868)/0.3196 ≈ 121.36. Hmm, that's around the atomic weight of magnesium is about 24.3, no, wait, 121 is more like tin (about 118.71). Alternatively, maybe Y is tin. Let me see.

Wait, but if x=3, and M≈121, then the formula is YF3. That would make sense if Y is tin (Sn), which has an atomic weight around 118.71.

Wait, but let me check: 118.71 + (3 *19) = 118.71 + 57 = 175.71 g/mol. So the formula weight of YF3 would be around 175.71. Then, the percentage of F would be (57)/(175.71) * 100 ≈ 32.44%. Wait, but the given oF is 31.96%, which is close. So that suggests that A2 is YF3 with Y being tin (Sn). So then, A2 is SnF3? Wait, but tin typically forms SnF4, not SnF3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe x=3 but Y is another element. Let me see another approach. Let's compute M for x=3.

M= (19 *3 *0.6804)/0.3196 = (57 * 0.6804)/0.3196 ≈ (38.7868)/0.3196 ≈ 121.36 g/mol.

Looking at the periodic table, around 121 is Te (tellurium, ~127.6), but that's higher. Or maybe it's another element.

Wait, 121 is actually close to the atomic weight of Cd (cadmium is about 112.4), but no. Wait, perhaps Y is another element. Let me think, maybe it's antimony (Sb, atomic weight ~121.76). So if Y is antimony, then YF3 would be SbF3. Let's compute the fluorine percentage: (3*19)/(121.76 + 3*19) = 57/(121.76 +57) =57/178.76 ≈ 0.3186 or 31.86%, which is close to 31.96%. That's within a small margin. So maybe Y is antimony, Sb.

So, A2 is SbF3. So when A1 decomposes, it's producing SbF3 and F2. So A1 could be a higher fluoride, like SbF5 or something else.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. If A1 is SbF5, for example. Then, the decomposition equation would be SbF5 → SbF3 + F2. Let's balance this. Let me write the equation:

SbF5 → SbF3 + F2

On the left: 5 F per molecule. On the right: 3 F (SbF3) + 2 F (F2). So total F on the right is 3 + 2*2 = 7? No, wait, each F2 molecule has 2 F atoms. So for each mole of F2, 2 F atoms are produced. So if we have x moles of SbF5 decomposing into y moles of SbF3 and z moles of F2:

Equation: 5x = 3y + 2z.

Also, the Sb atoms must balance: y = x, assuming only SbF3 is formed.

So substituting y = x into the F equation: 5x = 3x +2z → 2x =2z → x = z.

So the balanced equation would be:

2 SbF5 → 2 SbF3 + 5 F2.

Let me check: On the left, 2 *5 =10 F atoms. On the right: 2 *3 =6 F (from SbF3) +5 *2=10 F (from F2) → 6 +10=16. That's not matching. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the decomposition isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I've chosen the wrong A1.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is SbF4. Let me try that. Decomposition could be into SbF3 and F2.

Equation: SbF4 → SbF3 + F2.

Balancing F: 4 =3 + 2a → a=0.5. So multiply both sides by 2: 2 SbF4 → 2 SbF3 + F2.

Check: 2*4=8 F on left. On right: 2*3=6 F + 2 F (from F2) → 8 F. That works. Also Sb: 2 on both sides.

So in this case, when A1 (SbF4) decomposes, it produces A2 (SbF3) and F2. But then, the fluorine percentage in A2 (SbF3) would be 3*19/(121.76+57) = 57/178.76≈31.86%, which is close to 31.96%. So maybe that's correct.

So A1 is SbF4, which is a bright-red substance. Wait, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is another compound.

But let's proceed. So A1 is SbF4. It decomposes into SbF3 and F2. So A2 is SbF3.

Now, A1 (SbF4) oxidizes xenon. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps SbF4 is acting as an oxidizing agent, oxidizing xenon. What's the reaction? Xenon is in the zero oxidation state. So in the reaction, maybe Xe is oxidized to XeF2 or XeF4 or another fluoride.

Wait, but SbF4 is a fluoride. So perhaps when A1 (SbF4) reacts with Xe, it acts as a fluorine source. For example, SbF4 could be acting as a source of F- which reacts with Xe to form XeF2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's F2 that's acting as the oxidizing agent, but if A1 is SbF4, which decomposes to F2, then perhaps in the presence of Xe, it produces F2 which then reacts with Xe.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound that, when decomposed, releases F2, which then reacts with Xe. Let me think: If A1 is SbF4, and when it decomposes, it produces SbF3 and F2. The F2 can then react with Xe. So perhaps the reaction is Xe + F2 → XeF2 or XeF4, depending on conditions.

But I'm not exactly sure about this part. Let me move on.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y is Sb, and A3 is SbF3 or SbF5, but wait, earlier we thought A2 is SbF3. So perhaps A3 is another fluoride, like SbF5. Since A3 can also interact with xenon, maybe it's a stronger oxidizing agent.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, which would be Sb. So fluorinating Sb (probably in the presence of F2) would form SbF3, SbF5, etc. Let's think about the fluorination of antimony. Sb can form SbF3, SbF5, and maybe higher fluorides. But I'm not entirely certain.

Now, moving on to the next part: adding Y (antimony) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4. When they react, they form A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, when Y (Sb) is added to A4, it produces A5, which upon decomposition in water yields two substances.

What's A4? It's a solution, probably a salt. Since the solution is colorless and concentrated, maybe it's a solution of a fluoride or another salt. But if adding Y (Sb) produces A5, perhaps a substitution reaction is happening.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, and adding Sb in 1:1 ratio leads to the formation of a different fluoride. For example, maybe A4 is SbF5, which upon reaction with Sb metal, produces SbF3 and releases HF or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt of another element, and adding Sb displaces something. Let me think about another scenario. For instance, if A4 is a solution of a sulfide, maybe adding Sb would create a different compound. But that doesn't fit with the fluorine aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt like AlCl3. Then adding Sb might not form anything. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 decomposes into two substances, perhaps one is a gas and the other is a salt. For example, if A5 is a carbonate, it could decompose into CO2 and a metal oxide. But since the problem mentions fluorine compounds, perhaps A5 is a fluoride that breaks down into HF and another fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a compound like CaF2, which when heated decomposes, but in water, it's more likely to stay as is. Alternatively, maybe A5 is a hydrogen fluoride compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says when A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that reacts with water to produce an acid and a base. For example, if A5 is NaF, but that's not likely to decompose. Alternatively, perhaps it's a salt like CaCO3, which decomposes into CO2 and CaO, but that's not a fluoride.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a hydrogen fluoride salt, but I'm not certain.

Let me think again. Since A4 is a solution, perhaps it's a solution of Y's higher fluoride. For example, if Y is Sb, then SbF5 is a possible compound. So A4 could be SbF5 in solution. When Sb is added in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps it reacts to form a lower fluoride. So:

SbF5 + Sb → ?.

Let me consider the reaction: SbF5 + Sb → 2 SbF3 + HF↑ ?

But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces SbF4.

Wait, let's think about the formula. Let's say the reaction is SbF5 + Sb → 2 SbF3 + something. Let me balance it.

Sb: 1 (on left) → 2 (on right) → need 2 Sb on left. So 2 SbF5 + 2 Sb → 4 SbF3 + ... ?

Wait, 2 SbF5 + 2 Sb → 4 SbF3.

Let me count F: 2 *5 =10 F on left. On right: 4 *3=12 F. Not balanced. So perhaps it's 2 SbF5 + 2 Sb → 4 SbF3 + F2.

Wait, 2 SbF5 + 2 Sb → 4 SbF3 + F2.

Let me count Sb: 2 +2=4 on left. On right:4 Sb → yes. F: 2*5=10 on left. On right:4*3=12 (from SbF3) + 2 (from F2) → 14. Not matching. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is SbF5 + Sb → 2 SbF4. Let's see:

Sb: 1 +1=2 → 2 on right.

F:5 → 4*2=8 → not matching. Hmm, not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps when Sb is added to a solution of SbF5, it doesn't react, but maybe in another scenario.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of another fluoride, like YF6, and adding Y (Sb) in 1:1 molar ratio leads to the formation of YF4 or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound altogether. Let me think about the initial part again. The problem says that A4 is a binary compound of fluorine with Y. So A4 is YF_x.

If we have five binary compounds, perhaps Y can form YF, YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5, or maybe other combinations. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach the problem differently. The question is about finding the molecular weight of A4. So perhaps I should focus on what A4 is, based on the given information.

Let me recap:

- A1 is a bright-red substance, decomposes into A2 (which is YF3, with 31.96% F) and F2.

- A1 oxidizes Xe, which suggests it's a strong oxidizing agent, likely involving fluorine.

- A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so it's a higher fluoride, perhaps YF5, which can also react with Xe.

- A4 is a solution that when Y is added in 1:1 molar ratio, forms A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

Assuming Y is antimony (Sb), let's think about A4. If A4 is SbF5, which is a liquid or solid, but when dissolved in a solution, perhaps as a solution of SbF5. Alternatively, maybe it's a solution of a different salt, like KF (potassium fluoride) or something else, but that doesn't involve Y.

Wait, the problem says that A4 is a binary compound of fluorine with Y. So A4 must be YF_x.

So, perhaps A4 is YF5, which is a liquid that can dissociate in solution. When Y (Sb) is added, maybe it reacts to form a lower fluoride, like YF3. But the molar ratio is 1:1.

Wait, perhaps YF5 reacts with Y to form YF3. Let's write the equation:

YF5 + Y → 2 YF3.

But let's balance it. Y: 1 +1 =2 on right. F:5 on left, 3*2=6 on right. Doesn't match. So perhaps it's YF5 + Y → YF3 + something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is: YF5 + Y → YF3 + HF.

Let's balance it:

Y: 1 +1 →1 → need more. So 2 YF5 + 2 Y → 2 YF3 + 2 HF.

Check Y: 2 +2 → 2 → okay.

F: 2*5=10 → 2*3=6 + 2*1=2 → 6+2=8. Doesn't match. So perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces YF4.

Equation: YF5 + Y → YF4 + HF.

Left Y: 1+1=2 → right Y:1 → not balanced. Multiply by 2:

2 YF5 + 2 Y → 2 YF4 + 2 HF.

Y: 2+2=4 → 2 on right → no. Hmm, perhaps it's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is YF5 + Y → YF3 + 2 HF.

Balancing:

Y: 1 +1 →1 +1 → 2 each side.

F:5 +0 →3 +2*1 →5. So yes, 5 on both sides.

So the equation is YF5 + Y → YF3 + 2 HF.

That would mean that when Y is added to YF5, it produces YF3 and HF. So A5 would be YF3, but wait, earlier we thought A2 is YF3. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is something else. Maybe the solution of A4 is a salt, but I'm getting stuck.

Another angle: the decomposition of A5 in water produces two substances. If A5 is a salt that reacts with water, like a carbonate, it would produce CO2 and a hydroxide. But in this case, perhaps it's a fluoride reacting with water. Wait, but most fluorides are not that reactive.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a metallic fluoride that reacts with water to form a metal oxide and HF. For example, CaF2 doesn't react with water, but perhaps more reactive metals' fluorides do.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is an acid anhydride. For example, if A5 is F2SO4 (sulfuryl fluoride), but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a salt of hydrogen fluoride, like NaF, but that doesn't decompose in water.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to figure out the options, considering the molecular weight of A4.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

If Y is Sb (atomic weight ~121.76), then the possible fluorides would have molecular weights like:

- YF3: 121.76 +3*19=121.76+57=178.76 g/mol → 178.76, which is option C (160-180).

- YF4: 121.76 +4*19=121.76+76=197.76 → which would be option B (220-240)? No, 197 is below 220. So option B's lower end is 220. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A4 is YF5. Let's calculate that: 121.76 +5*19=121.76+95=216.76 g/mol. That would fall into option B (220-240). But 216 is just below 220. Hmm, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, if Y is Sb (121.76), YF5 would be 121.76 + (5×19)=121.76+95=216.76 g/mol. So that's approximately 217, which is just under option B (220-240). So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Alternatively, what if Y is tin (Sn), which has an atomic weight of about 118.71. Let's compute YF4: 118.71 +4×19=118.71+76=194.71 → ~195 g/mol, which would fall into option C (160-180)? No, 195 is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF3, which for Sn would be 118.71 +57=175.71 → ~176 g/mol, which fits option C (160-180).

But earlier, I thought A2 is YF3, which would have a molecular weight of around 176. So if A4 is a different compound, perhaps YF5, which would be 121.76 +95=216.76 → ~217, which is just under option B's 220. But that's close.

Wait, but if Y is antimony, Sb, then YF5 is 216.76, which is just under option B (220-240). So perhaps the correct option is B, but it's a bit iffy.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying Y. Let's try another approach.

If the fluorine percentage is 31.96% in A2, which is YF3, then the formula weight is M +57 = (57)/(0.3196) → because F is 31.96% of the compound. So, 0.3196 = (57)/(M +57) → M +57 =57 /0.3196 ≈178. So M ≈178 -57=121. So Y is about 121, which is tellurium (Te, atomic weight ~127.6)? Wait, no, Te is around 127.6, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's another element.

Wait, 121 is close to the atomic weight of Cd (112.4), but that's lower. Alternatively, maybe it's indium (In, ~114.87), but that's lower. Alternatively, perhaps it's tin (Sn, ~118.71). Wait, Sn is about 118.7, which is close to 121. So perhaps Y is tin.

So Y is Sn.

So A2 is SnF3. Let me compute the molecular weight of SnF3: Sn is about 118.71, F is 19. So 118.71 + 3*19 =118.71 +57=175.71 g/mol. The fluorine percentage is (57)/(175.71) *100 ≈32.44%, which is a bit higher than the given 31.96%, but close enough considering possible rounding.

So Y is tin (Sn). So let's reevaluate the compounds.

A1 is a binary compound of Sn and F. Which is bright red. I'm not sure about the color of SnF4, but I'll proceed.

A1 decomposes into A2 (SnF3) and F2. So the decomposition equation would be SnF4 → SnF3 + F2. Let's balance this.

SnF4 → SnF3 + F2.

On the left: 4 F, right:3 + 2*2=7 F? No, that doesn't balance. Hmm.

Wait, let me balance it:

Let me write the equation as aSnF4 → bSnF3 + cF2.

Sn: a = b.

F: 4a =3b + 2c.

Substituting a=b:

4b =3b + 2c → b=2c.

Let me choose c=1 → b=2 → a=2.

So equation: 2 SnF4 → 2 SnF3 + 2 F2.

Check F: 2*4=8 → 2*3=6 + 2*2=4 → 6+4=10 → no, not matching. Hmm, that's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me try c=2 → b=4 → a=4.

Equation: 4 SnF4 →4 SnF3 +4 F2.

F:4*4=16 →4*3=12 +4*2=8 →12+8=20 → not matching.

Hmm, no. Maybe the decomposition reaction is different. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is SnF2, but that's not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is SnF4, which upon decomposition produces Sn and F2. Let's see:

SnF4 → Sn + 2 F2.

That would balance: 4 F on left, 4 F on right (2 F2 is 4 F). Sn: 1 each side. So that works. So in this case, A2 would be Sn, but that doesn't fit because A2's fluorine percentage is 31.96%.

Wait, that can't be right because Sn as a pure element has 0% F. So that can't be the case. So perhaps the decomposition is different.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is SnF3, which upon decomposition produces SnF and F2. Let's see:

SnF3 → SnF + F2.

But I'm not sure about the balance. Let's try:

SnF3 → SnF + F2.

Sn: 1 each side. F:3 on left, 1 +2*2=5 on right. Not balanced. So another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is SnF3 → Sn + 3 F2.

But then F:3 →6. So that's not balanced.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should focus on A4. Since A4 is a binary compound of Sn and F, and when Sn is added in a 1:1 molar ratio, it forms A5. Let's think about possible reactions.

If A4 is SnF5, but I'm not sure if Sn forms that. Alternatively, SnF4 is more common. Let's assume A4 is SnF4. When Sn is added, perhaps it reacts to form SnF2.

So reaction: SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2.

Let me check:

Sn:1 +1=2 →2 on right.

F:4 →4 → yes.

So the equation is SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2.

That would produce A5 as SnF2. Now, when A5 (SnF2) is decomposed in water, perhaps it reacts with water. Wait, SnF2 is not very soluble in water, but if it does, maybe it decomposes. Alternatively, perhaps SnF2 reacts with water to form SnO and HF. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

But wait, the question says that in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So perhaps SnF2 + H2O → SnO + 2 HF.

But I'm not sure about the exact reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's SnF2 → SnF + HF, but I'm not certain.

But regardless, the main point is to find the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is SnF4, then its molecular weight is 118.71 (Sn) +4*19 (F) =118.71 +76=194.71 g/mol. So that falls into option C (160-180)? No, 194 is higher than that. Option B is 220-240, which is higher. Hmm, 194 is between 180-220, so not matching any option. Wait, the options are A)140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

So 194 falls into the range between 180 and 220, which isn't covered by the options. So perhaps I'm wrong about A4 being SnF4.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF2. Its molecular weight is 118.71 +38=156.71 g/mol. That fits in option A (140-160). But earlier, I thought A4 is a higher fluoride.

Wait, but the problem says that adding Y (Sn) in a 1:1 ratio to a hot concentrated solution of A4 (SnF2) would produce A5. Let's see:

If A4 is SnF2, and Y is Sn, the reaction could be SnF2 + Sn → SnF4? No, because that would require more F. Alternatively, perhaps it's a displacement reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF4, which upon adding Sn produces SnF2.

Wait, let me think: SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2.

That reaction would make sense. So A5 is SnF2.

The molecular weight of SnF4 is 118.71 +76=194.71, which is not in any of the options. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, another thought. If Y is iodine (I), let's see. Iodine has an atomic weight of about 126.9. Let's compute the fluorine percentage for YF3: (3*19)/(126.9+57)=57/(183.9)=31.01%. That's close to 31.96%, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

But this is getting too time-consuming, and perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the given options and the earlier calculation.

Earlier, I thought that Y was antimony (Sb) with a molecular weight of about 121.76. So YF5 would have a molecular weight of 121.76 +95=216.76, which is approximately 217 g/mol. The given options are A)140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130. 217 is just below 220, so it's close to option B (220-240). But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF3, which would be 175.71 g/mol (for Sb). That's in option C (160-180). But in that case, the reaction would be adding Y to YF3, which might not make sense.

Wait, another approach. The problem statement says that when adding Y in 1:1 ratio to A4's solution, a new substance A5 is formed. If A4 is a solution of YF6, adding Y could form YF4.

So, YF6 + Y → YF4 + 2 HF.

Let me compute the molecular weight of YF6. If Y is Sb (121.76), then YF6 is 121.76 +6*19=121.76 +114=235.76 g/mol. That falls into option B (220-240).

So perhaps A4 is YF6, and when Y is added, it produces YF4 and HF. So A5 would be YF4. Then, when A5 (YF4) is decomposed in water, it might produce YF3 and HF. Or perhaps it breaks down into Y and F2, but that would require heating.

Wait, but the problem says that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So if A5 is YF4, perhaps it reacts with water. YF4 + 2 H2O → Y(OH)2 + 4 HF. So Y(OH)2 and HF. That would fit the description.

So if A4 is YF6, its molecular weight is 121.76 +114=235.76 g/mol, which is within option B (220-240). So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, earlier we thought A2 was YF3, which would have a molecular weight of 175.71 for Y=Sb. So A4 is YF6, which would have a molecular weight of 235.76, which is in option B. So the correct option is B.

The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y, based on the given information. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Initial Deductions**:
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F2). This suggests A2 is likely a fluoride compound.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent, likely involving fluorine.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also interact with xenon, suggesting it is a higher fluoride than A2.
   - A4 is a binary compound of fluorine with Y. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - The fluorine percentage in A2 (31.96%) is used to deduce the identity of Y. For a compound of the form YF₃, the molecular weight of Y is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{M} = \frac{19 \cdot 3}{0.3196} - 57 \approx 121.76
     \]
     This corresponds to antimony (Sb), which has an atomic weight of approximately 121.76.

3. **Analyzing A4**:
   - A4 is a binary compound of fluorine with Y (Sb). Given the decomposition and reaction patterns, A4 is likely a higher fluoride, such as SbF₆.
   - The molecular weight of SbF₆ is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of SbF₆} = 121.76 + 6 \cdot 19 = 235.76 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]
     This value falls within the range **220-240**.

4. **Verification**:
   - The decomposition of A1 into A2 (SbF₃) and F₂ aligns with the given data.
   - A4 (SbF₆) reacts with Sb in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5 (likely SbF₄), which decomposes in water into two substances, consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₆) is approximately 235.76 g/mol, placing it in the range **220-240**.
