Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Right, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, so it's probably describing some kind of surface. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. In differential geometry, the area of a surface can be found using the metric.

Wait, so the area would involve integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, right? But wait, the metric is given in a specific form. Let me write it out properly. The metric is:

ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²)

So in terms of the metric tensor components, this would be:

g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0

So the determinant of the metric tensor, det(g), is g_{xx} * g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2. Since the off-diagonal terms are zero, det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

The area element in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt(det(g)) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area A would be the integral over all x and y where the denominator is positive, I guess. Wait, because the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain is the circle with radius 2. So the integration is over the disk of radius 2.

So the area is the integral of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over x² + y² <4. Hmmm, how do I compute this integral?

Wait, maybe a change of variables would help. Let's use polar coordinates since the region is a circle. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this step by step. First, factor out constants. 32 can be taken out, and the integral over θ would be from 0 to 2π.

So the area A = ∫θ ∫r [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, let's compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (32 * (-du/2)) / u → but wait, let's adjust the limits.

Wait, when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 * (-du/2)] / u.

But the limits are from 4 to 0, so I can reverse them and drop the negative sign.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=4 of [32*(du/2)] / u.

Wait, 32 multiplied by (1/2) is 16. So it's ∫ (16 / u) du from 0 to4.

Wait, but the integral of 1/u is ln|u| + C. So the integral from 0 to4 would be [16 ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches negative infinity. So 16 ln u evaluated at 0 is -infinity, and at 4 it's ln4. So the integral becomes 16 (ln4 - (-infty)) = 16 (infty), which is infinity. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but that would make the area integral diverge, meaning the area is infinite. But that can't be right, because a pseudosphere can't have infinite area, can it? Or wait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which is positive inside the circle of radius 2. So the domain is x² + y² <4.

But when I integrated, I found that the area integral gives a divergent result. That would imply that the area is infinite. But that can't be right for a pseudosphere. Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the geometry here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this isn't a compact surface. For a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature, the Gaussian curvature is K = -1/(r^2), where r is the radius scale. Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere is actually finite. Wait, no, wait. No, real pseudospheres (like the tractricoid) are finite in extent but have infinite surface area. Because as you go towards the edge, the circumference increases, leading to infinite area. Oh wait, maybe that's the case here.

Wait, the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix, has finite area but finite? No, wait, I think the tractricoid has finite area. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this metric represents a hyperbolic space, and the area of the pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic geometry) is being asked. But the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite. But a pseudosphere is like a finite region of hyperbolic space. Wait, but in this problem, the domain is x² + y² <4, which is a finite region, but the metric is singular at r=2.

Wait, the metric is singular at r=2 because the denominator goes to zero. So the Gaussian curvature would be K = - (1/(4 * (g_{rr}))) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in isothermal coordinates (where the metric is conformally flat, as it is here: ds² = f(x,y)(dx² + dy²)) is given by K = - (1/(2 f)) * Laplacian(f), where Laplacian is the 2D Laplacian.

So f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So compute the Laplacian of f.

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

Compute df/dr: derivative of 32/(4 - r²) with respect to r is (32) * (0 - (-2r))/(4 - r²)^2 → (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2.

So Laplacian f = (1/r) d/dr [ r * (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Compute inside the brackets: r * (64 r) = 64 r². So d/dr [64 r²/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Let me compute the derivative:

Let me set u = r², v = (4 - r²)^2.

So derivative of 64 u / v is 64 [ (v * du/dr - u dv/dr ) / v² ]

du/dr = 2r.

dv/dr = 2(4 - r²)(-2r) → -4r (4 - r²).

So numerator:

v * 2r - u * (-4r (4 - r²)) ) = 2r (4 - r²)^2 + 4r (r²)(4 - r²).

Factor out 2r (4 - r²):

= 2r (4 - r²) [ (4 - r²) + 2r² ]

= 2r (4 - r²) [4 - r² + 2 r² ] 

= 2 r (4 - r²)(4 + r² )

So the derivative is 64 [2r (4 - r²)(4 + r² ) ] / v².

But v = (4 - r²)^2, so v² = (4 - r²)^4.

So the derivative becomes 64 * 2 r (4 - r²)(4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^4 )

Simplify: (64 * 2 r (4 + r²)) / (4 - r²)^3 )

= 128 r (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

So Laplacian f(r) = (1/r) * [128 r (4 + r²) ) / (4 - r²)^3 ] 

Simplify: 128 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

Then, K = - (1/(2 f)) * Laplacian(f).

f is 32/(4 - r²).

So 1/(2 f) = (4 - r²)/(64).

Putting it all together: K = - (4 - r²)/(64) * [128 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3 ) ] 

Simplify:

= - [ (4 - r²) *128 (4 + r²) ) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^3) ]

= - [128 (4 + r²) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^2 )

= - [ 2 (4 + r²) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, the radius in the context of a pseudosphere usually refers to the curvature radius. For hyperbolic geometry, the radius is related to the curvature. So if K is the Gaussian curvature, then K = -1/(a^2), where a is the radius of curvature.

But perhaps that's a detour. Let me get back to the area computation.

So I computed the area as A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

After substitution, I found that the integral becomes ∫0^4 (16 / u ) du. Wait, wait, no, let me recheck that substitution.

Wait, when I made u = 4 - r², then as r increases from 0 to 2, u decreases from 4 to 0. So the integral ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr becomes ∫4^0 [32 * (-du/(2))]/u.

Wait, because dr = -du/(2r), but we have r dr = - du/2.

So the integral over r from 0 to2 becomes the integral over u from4 to 0 of [32 * ( - du/2 ) ] / u.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du.

But flipping the limits and dropping the negative sign gives (32/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u from 0 to4 is ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes 16( ln4 - (-infty) ) = 16 * (infty), which is infinity.

So the area is infinite. Hmm, but that can't be right for a pseudosphere. Or can it?

Wait, another thought: a pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry, and hyperbolic space has infinite area. But in this case, the metric is defined on a finite domain (r <2), so maybe the surface has finite area? But according to the integral, it's divergent. So maybe the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is +infty.

So the area is infinite, so the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think: Maybe the pseudosphere in this case is compact, but with the given metric, it's not. Because the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To compute the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element in differential geometry, which is derived from the metric tensor. The determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants, the integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Thus, the area becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

This result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere, which has infinite surface area due to its constant negative curvature and the singularity at \( r = 2 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**.
