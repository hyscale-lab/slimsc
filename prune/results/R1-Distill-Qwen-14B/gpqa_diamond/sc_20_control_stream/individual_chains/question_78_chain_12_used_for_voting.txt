Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t. The charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're to consider the time when the field was generated, which is at an earlier time tr. So t is larger than tr, meaning the effects from the past are propagating to the present.

I remember that potentials are usually related to charges and currents. The scalar potential V is due to the charge itself, while the vector potential A is due to the current created by the moving charge. But wait, the exact formulas—how do they come into play when the charge is moving?

Let me recall the retarded time concept. When charges are moving, the fields they produce at a later time depend on their position and velocity at an earlier time, called the retarded time. So the potentials also depend on these retarded quantities.

The scalar potential V is given by the charge divided by the distance, but maybe adjusted for the movement. Wait, no, the standard scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance. But when the charge is moving, do we have to modify this? Oh, right, the scalar potential at a point depends on the charge's position at the retarded time, so the distance isn't just the current distance but involves the movement—so maybe r is adjusted by the displacement due to the charge's velocity?

Wait, the problem defines d as the vector from the field generation point (at time tr) to the observation point r. So the distance between the charge's position at tr and the point r is d. So d has magnitude |d|, which would be the distance at that retarded time. But since the charge is moving, the distance between r and the charge's current position (at time t) is more complicated, but the potentials depend on the state at the retarded time tr.

So for the scalar potential V, it should be static if the charge isn't moving, but when it's moving, we might have some relativistic correction. Alternatively, maybe the expression for V is the same as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded time. Because V is due to the charge's presence, not its movement. Or maybe not—wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, actually, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/r), where r is the distance from the charge's position at time tr. So if the charge was at position s(tr), then d is the vector from s(tr) to r. So |d| is the distance at that time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factors, but wait, the options have V in terms of r, which is the current distance. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the problem says that d is the vector from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to the observation point r. So the distance is |d|, right? So the scalar potential at time t is V = q/(4πε₀ |d|). But wait, the options have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. So that might not be right because r is the current distance, not the past one. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe the options are using r as the distance from the current position of the charge to the point r, which would be different from d. Hmm, because d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So if the charge has moved since tr, then the distance between r and the charge's current position would be |r - s(t)|, but the potentials are based on the state at tr.

Wait, perhaps the correct V is q/(4πε₀ |d|), but the options don't have |d|, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option C and D: They have denominators involving (dc - d·v) or (dc + d·v), where d is a vector. Hmm, but that's in the denominator, so perhaps it's a Lorentz factor or something involving the velocity. Because when the charge is moving, length contraction or something might come into play.

Wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which looks like (c t - v t), perhaps, where t is the time it takes for the field to reach. Wait, but d is a vector. Alternatively, maybe it's the dot product of d and the unit vector dotted with velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the expression for the potentials. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t)/c²)], but no, that's more for the static case in a different context. Or perhaps the denominator is r minus the displacement due to the charge's movement.

Wait, another approach. The potentials can be written in terms of the charge's position and velocity. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function. But the exact form?

I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (r - s(t))) / ( |r - s(t)|² - (v t /c)^2 ) or something like that. But that's more complicated than the options presented. Alternatively, perhaps in the options, it's being expressed more simply.

Wait, let's consider the Lorenz gauge condition, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, think about the fields. The electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. And the magnetic field is B = ∇ × A.

But perhaps that's not the way to go. Let me think about the expressions for V and A for a moving charge. The scalar potential is static, but in reality, it's not because the charge is moving. So the scalar potential would involve the charge's position at the retarded time, but without considering the velocity, I think. So V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| )], but the options don't have |d|, so maybe I'm misunderstanding what d is.

Wait, the question defines d as the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance at the retarded time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|).

But looking at the options, option A and B have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. So that can't be right because r is the current distance. So perhaps the correct V is q/(4πε₀ |d|), but none of the options directly say that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)). Wait, d is a vector, but dc would be c multiplied by a vector d, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps it's |d| multiplied by c minus the dot product of d and v. So the denominator would be |d| c - d·v. Because d·v is a scalar, but |d| is also a scalar.

Wait, |d| is sqrt(d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2). So |d| c - d · v (since d · v is a scalar) would be a scalar, so the denominator makes sense. So option C has V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - d · v)).

Wait, but why would there be a c multiplied by |d|? Oh, maybe it's considering the time it took for the field to reach the point. Because the time delay would be t = |d| / c. So maybe the denominator is c |d| - d · v, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the Lorentz factor in the denominator. Wait, the Lorentz factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but not sure how that connects.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v / (c² (d c - (d · v)) ) ] or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the general expression for the vector potential. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at a point r and time t is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v(r - s(t))] / (|r - s(t)|² - (v · (t - tr))² c² )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [something].

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The scalar potential is due to the charge, while the vector potential is due to the current. So the scalar potential would be similar to the static case, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor, but which factor? Let's see the options.

Wait, looking at option C and D, they have V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v)) ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d · v is the dot product between d and v. Hmm.

Wait, suppose that the denominator is c |d| - (d · v). That would make sense if we're considering the time it takes for the charge's influence to reach r, which is |d| / c, but how does that tie into d · v? Since v is the velocity of the charge at time tr, perhaps the displacement of the charge from s(tr) to s(t) is v (t - tr). So the vector from the charge's new position to r is d - v (t - tr). But I'm not sure how that affects the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects when the charge is moving. So for potentials, perhaps the distance is scaled by a factor involving the velocity. Like, when the charge is moving, the effective distance becomes |d|√(1 - (v²/c²)) but that's for length contraction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the standard expressions for potentials. The scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|d|], as d is the distance at the retarded time. So that would make V = q/(4πε₀ |d|), which is what option C and D have but multiplied by c over some terms.

Wait, no, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v))) ) [I think the |d| is implicitly part of d, as d is a vector].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think: the potentials are usually given by integrals over the charge's history, but in this case, we can model it as the charge being at s(tr) with velocity v at that time. The potentials depend on the state of the charge at time tr, which is when the field was generated.

So for the scalar potential V, it's (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|d|.

For the vector potential A, it's (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × (r - s(tr))) / (|r - s(tr)|² (1 - (v²/c²)))^{1/2} ), but that's getting into more complicated vector calculus.

Wait, another thought: the vector potential due to a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) v, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the current, which is charge moving with velocity v, so current density J = q v δ(...), but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (d)) / (|d|² - (v (t - tr))² c² )

But I'm not sure. Maybe better to think in terms of the given options and see which ones make sense dimensionally.

Looking at option B: V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) V. So V is just the static scalar potential, and A is proportional to velocity times V, scaled by c squared.

Hmm, but if V is static, that ignores the movement of the charge. So perhaps that's not correct.

Option A has V same as B, and A is v squared times V over c squared. But that would make the vector potential proportional to v squared, which doesn't seem right because the vector potential should depend linearly on velocity.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let's think: the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × (r - s(tr)) ) / (|r - s(tr)|² - (v (t - tr))² c² )^{1/2} ), but this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the potentials in terms of their expressions when the charge is moving with velocity v.

Wait, I recall that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4 π) * [1/( (r - s(tr))² - (v (t - tr) )² c² )^{1/2} ] multiplied by (r - s(tr)).

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π (c²)) ) * something.

Another thought: the unit analysis might help. Let's check the options.

Option C: V has units of [charge]/([permittivity] [length]) which is [electric potential], which is correct. Similarly, A has units of [mu_0 charge speed]/[length], because mu0 has units H/m, which is T·m/A. So, mu0 * charge/(4pi) times velocity would have units:

mu0 (H/m) = (kg·m/(s²·A²)) ) * (C) * (m/s) / (m) ) → Let me calculate:

mu0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²). So in A's expression: mu0 * q * v has units:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * (m/s) → C is equivalent to A s. So substituting:

kg·m/(s²·A²) ) * A s * m/s → kg m²/(s² A) → But wait, A is ampere, so units would be kg m²/(s² A) → which is equivalent to (kg m^2)/(s^3 A), because s^2 A is s^2 * (s^-1 C), but I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let's think of vector potential A in SI units. Its unit is Tesla·meter² (since B is Tesla, and A is the integral of B over area, but that's not helpful). Wait, the unit of A is Weber per meter (Wb/m), and Weber is T·m², so unit is (T·m²)/m = T·m. Alternatively, using base units, T is kg/(s^2·A), so T·m is kg·m/(s^2·A).

So looking at option C's A:

mu_0 * q * c * v / [4 pi (d c - d·v ) ]

mu0 has units kg m/(s² A²), q is Coulombs (A s), v is m/s, c is m/s.

So numerator: kg m/(s² A²) * A s * m/s * m/s → kg m * (A s) * (m^2/s² ) ) / (s² A²) → Let's compute step by step:

mu0: kg m/(s² A²)
q: A s
v: m/s
c: m/s

Multiply them together: [kg m/(s² A²)] * [A s] * [m/s] * [m/s] = kg m * (A s) * m² / (s^4 A²) )

Wait, let me compute the exponents:

mu0: kg m / (s² A²)
q: A s
v: m/s
c: m/s

Multiply all together:

kg m / (s² A²) ) * A s * (m/s) * (m/s) = 

kg m * A s * m² / ( s^2 A^2 ) * s^2 ) → Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponents.

Let me list each unit factor:

kg: 1 kg
m: 1 m (from mu0) + 1 m (from v) + 1 m (from c) → 3 m
s: -2 s (from mu0) + 1 s (from q) -1 s (v) -1 s (c) → -2 +1-1-1 = -3 s
A: -2 A (from mu0) +1 A (from q) → -1 A

So the numerator's unit is kg m^3 s^{-3} A^{-1}.

Denominator in option C's A is 4 pi (d c - d·v), which is a length multiplied by c (m/s) minus (d is m, v is m/s → d·v is m^2/s). So d c is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. d·v is m*(m/s) → same as m²/s. So denominator is in m²/s.

So the entire expression for A in option C is numerator (kg m^3 s^{-3} A^{-1}) ) / denominator (m²/s) → 

(numerator) / denominator = (kg m^3 s^{-3} A^{-1}) ) * (s/m²) ) → kg m s^{-2} A^{-1}

Which is (kg m)/(s² A ), which matches the unit of A (since A is in T·m, and T is kg/(s² A), so T·m is kg·m/(s² A)). So the units match.

So option C's A has the correct units. What about V?

V in option C is qc/(4pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v)).

epsilon0 has units C²/(N·m²) → (C² s^4 kg^{-1} m^{-3}).

So let's compute the units:

q is C, c is m/s, denominator is m²/s (same as before).

So V's unit:

[C] * [m/s] / [ (C² s^4 kg^{-1} m^{-3}) ) * (m²/s) ) ]

Wait, denominator inside the big denominator is (d c - d·v), which is m²/s.

So the denominator is 4 pi epsilon0 times (m²/s). So the entire denominator's unit is (C² s^4 kg^{-1} m^{-3}) ) * (m²/s ) ) = C² s^3 kg^{-1} m^{-1}.

So V's unit is [C * m/s ] / [ C² s^3 kg^{-1} m^{-1} ] ) = 

Multiply numerator and denominator:

[C m/s ] * [ kg m / (C² s^3 ) ) ] 

Wait, reciprocal is [ kg m / (C² s^3 ) ) ].

So numerator: C m / s.

Denominator: C² s^3 / (kg m )

So together, (C m /s ) * (kg m )/( C² s^3 ) ) = kg m² / ( C s^4 )

But the unit for voltage is J/C = (kg m²/s² ) / C. So how does this compare?

Wait, kg m²/(C s^4 ) → kg m²/( (A s) s^4 ) ) → kg m²/(A s^5 )

Not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute V's unit differently.

V is ( q c ) / (4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v) )

So units:

q → C

c → m/s.

Denominator: [d c] → m * m/s → m²/s.

So denominator is 4 pi epsilon0 * (m²/s). Epsilon0 has units C²/(N m²) ) → C² s²/(kg m^3 )

So denominator's unit: [C² s²/(kg m^3 ) ] * (m²/s) ) → C² s² m² / (kg m^3 s ) ) → C² s/(kg m )

So V's unit is [C * (m/s) ] / [ C² s/(kg m ) ] ) → 

[C * m/s ] * [ kg m / (C² s) ) ] = kg m² / ( C s² )

But voltage is kg m²/( C s³ ), since 1 V = 1 J/C = (kg m²/s² ) / (C ) → kg m²/(C s² )

Wait, so this gives kg m²/(C s² ), which is the same as V. So the unit matches.

So the units for option C's V and A are correct. That makes option C a possible candidate.

Looking back at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v) ), and A is (mu0 qc v )/(4 pi (d c - d·v) )

Wait, but in the denominator, it's (d c - d·v) which is m^2/s. So the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), which is m^2/s.

So the expression for V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v) )

But wait, why is there a c in the numerator? Because in the static case, V is q/(4 pi epsilon0 r ), but here, the denominator is (d c - d · v ) which has units of m²/s. So to get the same units as the static V, perhaps we need to divide by (d c) to get 1/(m), but it's (d c - d·v) in denominator, which is m²/s, so to get 1/m, perhaps we have to have (d c - d·v ) in the denominator, multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Option C has V and A expressions that have the same denominator, (d c - d·v ), which is a scalar. So V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d ·v) ), and A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c -d ·v) )

Wait, the denominator in both is same, which might make sense for their ratio.

So, let's think about the ratio A/V.

In option C, A is (mu0 c v )/(4 pi epsilon0 (denominator) ) * ( q ) ... Wait, no, wait:

Wait, V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator )

A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator )

So A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) ) * (q ) / (4 pi epsilon0 denominator )^{-1} )

Wait, no, better to compute A/V.

A/V = [ (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator) ) ] / [ ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) ) ]

Simplify:

A/V = (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ) ) * (4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) / ( q c )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

mu0 epsilon0 v.

So A = (mu0 epsilon0 v ) * V.

But mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², so A = (v / c² ) * V.

Which would match option B, where A is (v/c²) V.

But according to option C, A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me compute again.

A = [mu0 q c v ] / [4 pi (d c - d·v) ]

V = [ q c ] / [4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d ·v) ]

So A/V = [mu0 q c v / denominator ] / [ q c / (4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) ]

Wait, no: denominator is (d c - d ·v ), which is same in both.

So A/V = [ (mu0 q c v ) / denominator ] * [4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) / (q c ) ] 

Simplify:

mu0 * v * 4 pi epsilon0 / (4 pi )

Because the q c and denominator terms cancel.

So A/V = mu0 epsilon0 v.

But mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², so A = (v / c² ) * V.

Which would make A equal to (v/c²) V, as in option B.

But option C's A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ), which would imply a different relation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, in option C, A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ), and V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator )

So A = [ mu0 c v / (4 pi denominator ) ] * q

V = [ q c ] / [4 pi epsilon0 denominator ]

So A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi denominator ) * q → but V is ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator )

So A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi denominator ) * [ 4 pi epsilon0 denominator / ( q c ) ] * V

Simplifying:

A = (mu0 c v ) * epsilon0 * V / ( c )

= mu0 epsilon0 v V.

But mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², so A = v V / c².

Which means A = (v/c²) V.

Which would match option B.

But according to option C, V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ), and A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator )

So in terms of V, A is (mu0 c v )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) * [4 pi epsilon0 denominator / (q c ) ] * V.

Wait, no, perhaps better to write A in terms of V.

Since V = (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ), then q = [4 pi epsilon0 denominator V ]/(c )

Substitute q into A:

A = [ mu0 * [4 pi epsilon0 denominator V / c ] * c v ] / (4 pi denominator )

Simplify numerator:

mu0 * 4 pi epsilon0 denominator V * c v / c → mu0 *4 pi epsilon0 denominator V v.

Denominator: 4 pi denominator.

So A = (mu0 epsilon0 v V ) * (4 pi denominator ) / (4 pi denominator )

Which simplifies to A = mu0 epsilon0 v V.

Again, since mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², A = (v V)/c².

Which is option B. But option C's A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ), which implies that A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi denominator ) * q. But when expressed in terms of V, it's (v/c²) V.

Which would mean that both option C and B have the same A in terms of V. But in option B, V is static, which can't be correct because the charge is moving. So I'm getting confused.

Hmm, perhaps the correct choice is option C or D, because their expressions involve the velocity and the distance.

Wait, another approach: the potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to both electric and magnetic fields.

The Lorentz gauge condition is ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t =0. But without knowing the exact potentials, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are those in option C or D, because they include the velocity in the denominator, which is necessary for a moving charge.

Wait, another thought. The scalar potential for a moving charge should account for the fact that the charge's influence travels at speed c. So the distance isn't just the current distance but adjusted by the movement. So perhaps the denominator in V is (c t - v · t ), where t is the time taken for the influence to reach the point. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me look for key points.

The vector potential should be proportional to velocity and the charge. The scalar potential is the static one evaluated at the retarded time.

Looking at the options:

Option C: V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d · v) ), which seems to have the charge multiplied by c, which is unusual.

Option D: V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c + d · v) ), same as C but with a plus sign.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (d · v)), which would be time-like separation in special relativity. Because in spacetime, the separation between two events is (c dt)^2 - |d|^2. If the charge is moving, the time it takes for the field to reach us is t = |d|/c, but because the charge is moving, the actual time would be adjusted.

Wait, the spacetime interval is s² = c² (t - t_r )² - |d|², where t - t_r is the time delay. But I'm not sure how that ties into the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - d · v) which is c |d| - d · v, but d · v is |d||v| cos(theta), where theta is the angle between d and v. So if the charge is moving towards or away from us, this term would adjust the denominator.

So for a charge moving directly towards the point r, d and v are in the same direction, so d · v = |d| v. So denominator becomes c |d| - |d| v = |d| (c - v )

But if v is small compared to c, this approximates to |d| (c (1 - v/c )) → so denominator is |d| c multiplied by (1 - v/(c) ), leading to a term like 1/( |d| c (1 - v/c) ) → which would be approx 1/(|d| c ) (1 + v/c ), a sort of relativistic correction.

So V would have a term involving 1/( |d| c (1 - v/c) ), which after expansion would have a 1/(|d| c ) plus a term with v/(c² |d| ), but I'm not sure.

But according to the options, option C has V as (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 ( d c - d ·v ) )

Assuming that d is the vector, perhaps the denominator is ( c |d| - d · v )

So when the charge is moving directly towards the point (d and v same direction), d · v = |d| v, so denominator is c |d| - |d| v = |d| (c - v )

So V would be ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| (c - v )) )

Which could be rewritten as V = ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| ) * [ 1/(c - v ) ]

But when v is small, 1/(c - v ) ≈ (1/c)(1 + v/c ), so V ≈ ( q )/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| ) (1 + v/c^2 )

But I'm not sure if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps V should be (q/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| )) (1/(1 - (v/c)) ), but that's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which would make the denominator smaller if the charge is moving towards us (since d · v is positive), leading to a larger V. Which makes sense because if the charge is moving towards you, its influence arrives sooner, so the potential would be higher.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's think about the other options.

Option B: V is static q/(4 pi epsilon0 r ), which would ignore the movement. So it's incorrect because the charge is moving.

Options A and B have V as the static potential, which is probably wrong.

So between options C and D.

The denominator in option D is (d c + d · v ), so when the charge is moving towards us, d · v is positive, so denominator is larger, making V smaller. Which doesn't make sense. Because if the charge is moving towards the observation point, the potential should be higher, not lower.

Wait, no. If the charge is moving towards us, the effective distance is less than |d|, so the denominator would be smaller, making V larger. So if the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which is smaller when d · v is positive (charge moving towards us), then V is larger. That makes sense.

So option C's denominator is (d c - d ·v ), which for d and v in the same direction (charge moving towards us) makes denominator smaller, V larger. Which is correct.

So I think option C is correct.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded time formalism and the relativistic corrections due to the charge's motion.

   - The scalar potential is influenced by the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \), where the field was generated. The distance between the charge's position at \( t_r \) and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is represented by the vector \( \vec{d} \).
   - The static scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), but for a moving charge, relativistic corrections must be included. These corrections modify the denominator to account for the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and the propagation speed \( c \).
   - Option \( C \) introduces a denominator \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \), which correctly incorporates the relativistic effects. This ensures that the potential increases when the charge moves toward the observer (positive \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \)).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and depends on the same retarded time \( t_r \). It is influenced by the same denominator \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) as the scalar potential.
   - Option \( C \) provides \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), which aligns with the expected form of the vector potential for a moving charge.

3. **Comparison of Options:**
   - **Option \( A \):** Incorrect because it assumes \( \vec{A} \propto \vec{v}^2 \), which does not match the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \).
   - **Option \( B \):** Incorrect because it uses the static scalar potential \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), ignoring the relativistic corrections due to the charge's motion.
   - **Option \( D \):** Incorrect because the denominator \( (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) does not correctly account for the relativistic effects. When the charge moves toward the observer, the denominator increases, leading to an incorrect decrease in the potential.
   - **Option \( C \):** Correct because it incorporates the relativistic corrections in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), ensuring proper scaling with the charge's velocity and the propagation speed \( c \).

### Conclusion:
Option \( C \) provides the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, consistent with the retarded time formalism and relativistic corrections.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t. The charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're to consider the time when the field was generated, which is at an earlier time tr. So t is larger than tr, meaning the effects from the past are propagating to the present.

I remember that potentials are usually related to charges and currents. The scalar potential V is due to the charge itself, while the vector potential A is due to the current created by the moving charge. But wait, the exact formulas—how do they come into play when the charge is moving?

Let me recall the retarded time concept. When charges are moving, the fields they produce at a later time depend on their position and velocity at an earlier time, called the retarded time. So the potentials also depend on these retarded quantities.

The scalar potential V is given by the charge divided by the distance, but maybe adjusted for the movement. Wait, no, the standard scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance. But when the charge is moving, do we have to modify this? Oh, right, the scalar potential at a point depends on the charge's position at the retarded time, so the distance isn't just the current distance but involves the movement—so maybe r is adjusted by the displacement due to the charge's velocity?

Wait, the problem defines d as the vector from the field generation point (at time tr) to the observation point r. So the distance between the charge's position at tr and the point r is d. So d has magnitude |d|, which would be the distance at that retarded time. But since the charge is moving, the distance between r and the charge's current position (at time t) is more complicated, but the potentials depend on the state at the retarded time tr.

So for the scalar potential V, it should be static if the charge isn't moving, but when it's moving, we might have some relativistic correction. Alternatively, maybe the expression for V is the same as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded time. Because V is due to the charge's presence, not its movement. Or maybe not—wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, actually, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/r), where r is the distance from the charge's position at time tr. So if the charge was at position s(tr), then d is the vector from s(tr) to r. So |d| is the distance at that time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factors, but wait, the options have V in terms of r, which is the current distance. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the problem says that d is the vector from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to the observation point r. So the distance is |d|, right? So the scalar potential at time t is V = q/(4πε₀ |d|). But wait, the options have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. So that might not be right because r is the current distance, not the past one. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe the options are using r as the distance from the current position of the charge to the point r, which would be different from d. Hmm, because d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So if the charge has moved since tr, then the distance between r and the charge's current position would be |r - s(t)|, but the potentials are based on the state at tr.

Wait, perhaps the correct V is q/(4πε₀ |d|), but the options don't have |d|, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option C and D: They have denominators involving (dc - d·v) or (dc + d·v), where d is a vector. Hmm, but that's in the denominator, so perhaps it's a Lorentz factor or something involving the velocity. Because when the charge is moving, length contraction or something might come into play.

Wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which looks like (c t - v t), perhaps, where t is the time it takes for the field to reach. Wait, but d is a vector. Alternatively, maybe it's the dot product of d and the unit vector dotted with velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the expression for the potentials. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t)/c²)], but no, that's more for the static case in a different context. Or perhaps the denominator is r minus the displacement due to the charge's movement.

Wait, another approach. The potentials can be written in terms of the charge's position and velocity. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function. But the exact form?

I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (r - s(t))) / ( |r - s(t)|² - (v t /c)^2 ) or something like that. But that's more complicated than the options presented. Alternatively, perhaps in the options, it's being expressed more simply.

Wait, let's consider the Lorenz gauge condition, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, think about the fields. The electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. And the magnetic field is B = ∇ × A.

But perhaps that's not the way to go. Let me think about the expressions for V and A for a moving charge. The scalar potential is static, but in reality, it's not because the charge is moving. So the scalar potential would involve the charge's position at the retarded time, but without considering the velocity, I think. So V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| )], but the options don't have |d|, so maybe I'm misunderstanding what d is.

Wait, the question defines d as the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance at the retarded time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|).

But looking at the options, option A and B have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. So that can't be right because r is the current distance. So perhaps the correct V is q/(4πε₀ |d|), but none of the options directly say that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)). Wait, d is a vector, but dc would be c multiplied by a vector d, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps it's |d| multiplied by c minus the dot product of d and v. So the denominator would be |d| c - d·v. Because d·v is a scalar, but |d| is also a scalar.

Wait, |d| is sqrt(d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2). So |d| c - d · v (since d · v is a scalar) would be a scalar, so the denominator makes sense. So option C has V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - d · v)).

Wait, but why would there be a c multiplied by |d|? Oh, maybe it's considering the time it took for the field to reach the point. Because the time delay would be t = |d| / c. So maybe the denominator is c |d| - d · v, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the Lorentz factor in the denominator. Wait, the Lorentz factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but not sure how that connects.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v / (c² (d c - (d · v)) ) ] or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the general expression for the vector potential. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at a point r and time t is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v(r - s(t))] / (|r - s(t)|² - (v · (t - tr))² c² )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [something].

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The scalar potential is due to the charge, while the vector potential is due to the current. So the scalar potential would be similar to the static case, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor, but which factor? Let's see the options.

Wait, looking at option C and D, they have V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v)) ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d · v is the dot product between d and v. Hmm.

Wait, suppose that the denominator is c |d| - (d · v). That would make sense if we're considering the time it takes for the charge's influence to reach r, which is |d| / c, but how does that tie into d · v? Since v is the velocity of the charge at time tr, perhaps the displacement of the charge from s(tr) to s(t) is v (t - tr). So the vector from the charge's new position to r is d - v (t - tr). But I'm not sure how that affects the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects when the charge is moving. So for potentials, perhaps the distance is scaled by a factor involving the velocity. Like, when the charge is moving, the effective distance becomes |d|√(1 - (v²/c²)) but that's for length contraction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the standard expressions for potentials. The scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|d|], as d is the distance at the retarded time. So that would make V = q/(4πε₀ |d|), which is what option C and D have but multiplied by c over some terms.

Wait, no, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v))) ) [I think the |d| is implicitly part of d, as d is a vector].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think: the potentials are usually given by integrals over the charge's history, but in this case, we can model it as the charge being at s(tr) with velocity v at that time. The potentials depend on the state of the charge at time tr, which is when the field was generated.

So for the scalar potential V, it's (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|d|.

For the vector potential A, it's (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × (r - s(tr))) / (|r - s(tr)|² (1 - (v²/c²)))^{1/2} ), but that's getting into more complicated vector calculus.

Wait, another thought: the vector potential due to a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) v, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the current, which is charge moving with velocity v, so current density J = q v δ(...), but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (d)) / (|d|² - (v (t - tr))² c² )

But I'm not sure. Maybe better to think in terms of the given options and see which ones make sense dimensionally.

Looking at option B: V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) V. So V is just the static scalar potential, and A is proportional to velocity times V, scaled by c squared.

Hmm, but if V is static, that ignores the movement of the charge. So perhaps that's not correct.

Option A has V same as B, and A is v squared times V over c squared. But that would make the vector potential proportional to v squared, which doesn't seem right because the vector potential should depend linearly on velocity.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let's think: the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × (r - s(tr)) ) / (|r - s(tr)|² - (v (t - tr))² c² )^{1/2} ), but this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the potentials in terms of their expressions when the charge is moving with velocity v.

Wait, I recall that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4 π) * [1/( (r - s(tr))² - (v (t - tr) )² c² )^{1/2} ] multiplied by (r - s(tr)).

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π (c²)) ) * something.

Another thought: the unit analysis might help. Let's check the options.

Option C: V has units of [charge]/([permittivity] [length]) which is [electric potential], which is correct. Similarly, A has units of [mu_0 charge speed]/[length], because mu0 has units H/m, which is T·m/A. So, mu0 * charge/(4pi) times velocity would have units:

mu0 (H/m) = (kg·m/(s²·A²)) ) * (C) * (m/s) / (m) ) → Let me calculate:

mu0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²). So in A's expression: mu0 * q * v has units:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * (m/s) → C is equivalent to A s. So substituting:

kg·m/(s²·A²) ) * A s * m/s → kg m²/(s² A) → But wait, A is ampere, so units would be kg m²/(s² A) → which is equivalent to (kg m^2)/(s^3 A), because s^2 A is s^2 * (s^-1 C), but I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let's think of vector potential A in SI units. Its unit is Tesla·meter² (since B is Tesla, and A is the integral of B over area, but that's not helpful). Wait, the unit of A is Weber per meter (Wb/m), and Weber is T·m², so unit is (T·m²)/m = T·m. Alternatively, using base units, T is kg/(s^2·A), so T·m is kg·m/(s^2·A).

So looking at option C's A:

mu_0 * q * c * v / [4 pi (d c - d·v ) ]

mu0 has units kg m/(s² A²), q is Coulombs (A s), v is m/s, c is m/s.

So numerator: kg m/(s² A²) * A s * m/s * m/s → kg m * (A s) * (m^2/s² ) ) / (s² A²) → Let's compute step by step:

mu0: kg m/(s² A²)
q: A s
v: m/s
c: m/s

Multiply them together: [kg m/(s² A²)] * [A s] * [m/s] * [m/s] = kg m * (A s) * m² / (s^4 A²) )

Wait, let me compute the exponents:

mu0: kg m / (s² A²)
q: A s
v: m/s
c: m/s

Multiply all together:

kg m / (s² A²) ) * A s * (m/s) * (m/s) = 

kg m * A s * m² / ( s^2 A^2 ) * s^2 ) → Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponents.

Let me list each unit factor:

kg: 1 kg
m: 1 m (from mu0) + 1 m (from v) + 1 m (from c) → 3 m
s: -2 s (from mu0) + 1 s (from q) -1 s (v) -1 s (c) → -2 +1-1-1 = -3 s
A: -2 A (from mu0) +1 A (from q) → -1 A

So the numerator's unit is kg m^3 s^{-3} A^{-1}.

Denominator in option C's A is 4 pi (d c - d·v), which is a length multiplied by c (m/s) minus (d is m, v is m/s → d·v is m^2/s). So d c is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. d·v is m*(m/s) → same as m²/s. So denominator is in m²/s.

So the entire expression for A in option C is numerator (kg m^3 s^{-3} A^{-1}) ) / denominator (m²/s) → 

(numerator) / denominator = (kg m^3 s^{-3} A^{-1}) ) * (s/m²) ) → kg m s^{-2} A^{-1}

Which is (kg m)/(s² A ), which matches the unit of A (since A is in T·m, and T is kg/(s² A), so T·m is kg·m/(s² A)). So the units match.

So option C's A has the correct units. What about V?

V in option C is qc/(4pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v)).

epsilon0 has units C²/(N·m²) → (C² s^4 kg^{-1} m^{-3}).

So let's compute the units:

q is C, c is m/s, denominator is m²/s (same as before).

So V's unit:

[C] * [m/s] / [ (C² s^4 kg^{-1} m^{-3}) ) * (m²/s) ) ]

Wait, denominator inside the big denominator is (d c - d·v), which is m²/s.

So the denominator is 4 pi epsilon0 times (m²/s). So the entire denominator's unit is (C² s^4 kg^{-1} m^{-3}) ) * (m²/s ) ) = C² s^3 kg^{-1} m^{-1}.

So V's unit is [C * m/s ] / [ C² s^3 kg^{-1} m^{-1} ] ) = 

Multiply numerator and denominator:

[C m/s ] * [ kg m / (C² s^3 ) ) ] 

Wait, reciprocal is [ kg m / (C² s^3 ) ) ].

So numerator: C m / s.

Denominator: C² s^3 / (kg m )

So together, (C m /s ) * (kg m )/( C² s^3 ) ) = kg m² / ( C s^4 )

But the unit for voltage is J/C = (kg m²/s² ) / C. So how does this compare?

Wait, kg m²/(C s^4 ) → kg m²/( (A s) s^4 ) ) → kg m²/(A s^5 )

Not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute V's unit differently.

V is ( q c ) / (4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v) )

So units:

q → C

c → m/s.

Denominator: [d c] → m * m/s → m²/s.

So denominator is 4 pi epsilon0 * (m²/s). Epsilon0 has units C²/(N m²) ) → C² s²/(kg m^3 )

So denominator's unit: [C² s²/(kg m^3 ) ] * (m²/s) ) → C² s² m² / (kg m^3 s ) ) → C² s/(kg m )

So V's unit is [C * (m/s) ] / [ C² s/(kg m ) ] ) → 

[C * m/s ] * [ kg m / (C² s) ) ] = kg m² / ( C s² )

But voltage is kg m²/( C s³ ), since 1 V = 1 J/C = (kg m²/s² ) / (C ) → kg m²/(C s² )

Wait, so this gives kg m²/(C s² ), which is the same as V. So the unit matches.

So the units for option C's V and A are correct. That makes option C a possible candidate.

Looking back at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v) ), and A is (mu0 qc v )/(4 pi (d c - d·v) )

Wait, but in the denominator, it's (d c - d·v) which is m^2/s. So the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), which is m^2/s.

So the expression for V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d·v) )

But wait, why is there a c in the numerator? Because in the static case, V is q/(4 pi epsilon0 r ), but here, the denominator is (d c - d · v ) which has units of m²/s. So to get the same units as the static V, perhaps we need to divide by (d c) to get 1/(m), but it's (d c - d·v) in denominator, which is m²/s, so to get 1/m, perhaps we have to have (d c - d·v ) in the denominator, multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Option C has V and A expressions that have the same denominator, (d c - d·v ), which is a scalar. So V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d ·v) ), and A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c -d ·v) )

Wait, the denominator in both is same, which might make sense for their ratio.

So, let's think about the ratio A/V.

In option C, A is (mu0 c v )/(4 pi epsilon0 (denominator) ) * ( q ) ... Wait, no, wait:

Wait, V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator )

A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator )

So A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) ) * (q ) / (4 pi epsilon0 denominator )^{-1} )

Wait, no, better to compute A/V.

A/V = [ (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator) ) ] / [ ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) ) ]

Simplify:

A/V = (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ) ) * (4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) / ( q c )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

mu0 epsilon0 v.

So A = (mu0 epsilon0 v ) * V.

But mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², so A = (v / c² ) * V.

Which would match option B, where A is (v/c²) V.

But according to option C, A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me compute again.

A = [mu0 q c v ] / [4 pi (d c - d·v) ]

V = [ q c ] / [4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d ·v) ]

So A/V = [mu0 q c v / denominator ] / [ q c / (4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) ]

Wait, no: denominator is (d c - d ·v ), which is same in both.

So A/V = [ (mu0 q c v ) / denominator ] * [4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) / (q c ) ] 

Simplify:

mu0 * v * 4 pi epsilon0 / (4 pi )

Because the q c and denominator terms cancel.

So A/V = mu0 epsilon0 v.

But mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², so A = (v / c² ) * V.

Which would make A equal to (v/c²) V, as in option B.

But option C's A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ), which would imply a different relation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, in option C, A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ), and V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator )

So A = [ mu0 c v / (4 pi denominator ) ] * q

V = [ q c ] / [4 pi epsilon0 denominator ]

So A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi denominator ) * q → but V is ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator )

So A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi denominator ) * [ 4 pi epsilon0 denominator / ( q c ) ] * V

Simplifying:

A = (mu0 c v ) * epsilon0 * V / ( c )

= mu0 epsilon0 v V.

But mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², so A = v V / c².

Which means A = (v/c²) V.

Which would match option B.

But according to option C, V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ), and A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator )

So in terms of V, A is (mu0 c v )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ) * [4 pi epsilon0 denominator / (q c ) ] * V.

Wait, no, perhaps better to write A in terms of V.

Since V = (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 denominator ), then q = [4 pi epsilon0 denominator V ]/(c )

Substitute q into A:

A = [ mu0 * [4 pi epsilon0 denominator V / c ] * c v ] / (4 pi denominator )

Simplify numerator:

mu0 * 4 pi epsilon0 denominator V * c v / c → mu0 *4 pi epsilon0 denominator V v.

Denominator: 4 pi denominator.

So A = (mu0 epsilon0 v V ) * (4 pi denominator ) / (4 pi denominator )

Which simplifies to A = mu0 epsilon0 v V.

Again, since mu0 epsilon0 = 1/c², A = (v V)/c².

Which is option B. But option C's A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ), which implies that A = (mu0 c v )/(4 pi denominator ) * q. But when expressed in terms of V, it's (v/c²) V.

Which would mean that both option C and B have the same A in terms of V. But in option B, V is static, which can't be correct because the charge is moving. So I'm getting confused.

Hmm, perhaps the correct choice is option C or D, because their expressions involve the velocity and the distance.

Wait, another approach: the potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to both electric and magnetic fields.

The Lorentz gauge condition is ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t =0. But without knowing the exact potentials, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are those in option C or D, because they include the velocity in the denominator, which is necessary for a moving charge.

Wait, another thought. The scalar potential for a moving charge should account for the fact that the charge's influence travels at speed c. So the distance isn't just the current distance but adjusted by the movement. So perhaps the denominator in V is (c t - v · t ), where t is the time taken for the influence to reach the point. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me look for key points.

The vector potential should be proportional to velocity and the charge. The scalar potential is the static one evaluated at the retarded time.

Looking at the options:

Option C: V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c - d · v) ), which seems to have the charge multiplied by c, which is unusual.

Option D: V is (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 (d c + d · v) ), same as C but with a plus sign.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (d · v)), which would be time-like separation in special relativity. Because in spacetime, the separation between two events is (c dt)^2 - |d|^2. If the charge is moving, the time it takes for the field to reach us is t = |d|/c, but because the charge is moving, the actual time would be adjusted.

Wait, the spacetime interval is s² = c² (t - t_r )² - |d|², where t - t_r is the time delay. But I'm not sure how that ties into the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - d · v) which is c |d| - d · v, but d · v is |d||v| cos(theta), where theta is the angle between d and v. So if the charge is moving towards or away from us, this term would adjust the denominator.

So for a charge moving directly towards the point r, d and v are in the same direction, so d · v = |d| v. So denominator becomes c |d| - |d| v = |d| (c - v )

But if v is small compared to c, this approximates to |d| (c (1 - v/c )) → so denominator is |d| c multiplied by (1 - v/(c) ), leading to a term like 1/( |d| c (1 - v/c) ) → which would be approx 1/(|d| c ) (1 + v/c ), a sort of relativistic correction.

So V would have a term involving 1/( |d| c (1 - v/c) ), which after expansion would have a 1/(|d| c ) plus a term with v/(c² |d| ), but I'm not sure.

But according to the options, option C has V as (q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 ( d c - d ·v ) )

Assuming that d is the vector, perhaps the denominator is ( c |d| - d · v )

So when the charge is moving directly towards the point (d and v same direction), d · v = |d| v, so denominator is c |d| - |d| v = |d| (c - v )

So V would be ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| (c - v )) )

Which could be rewritten as V = ( q c )/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| ) * [ 1/(c - v ) ]

But when v is small, 1/(c - v ) ≈ (1/c)(1 + v/c ), so V ≈ ( q )/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| ) (1 + v/c^2 )

But I'm not sure if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps V should be (q/(4 pi epsilon0 |d| )) (1/(1 - (v/c)) ), but that's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which would make the denominator smaller if the charge is moving towards us (since d · v is positive), leading to a larger V. Which makes sense because if the charge is moving towards you, its influence arrives sooner, so the potential would be higher.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's think about the other options.

Option B: V is static q/(4 pi epsilon0 r ), which would ignore the movement. So it's incorrect because the charge is moving.

Options A and B have V as the static potential, which is probably wrong.

So between options C and D.

The denominator in option D is (d c + d · v ), so when the charge is moving towards us, d · v is positive, so denominator is larger, making V smaller. Which doesn't make sense. Because if the charge is moving towards the observation point, the potential should be higher, not lower.

Wait, no. If the charge is moving towards us, the effective distance is less than |d|, so the denominator would be smaller, making V larger. So if the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which is smaller when d · v is positive (charge moving towards us), then V is larger. That makes sense.

So option C's denominator is (d c - d ·v ), which for d and v in the same direction (charge moving towards us) makes denominator smaller, V larger. Which is correct.

So I think option C is correct.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded time formalism and the relativistic corrections due to the charge's motion.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential is influenced by the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \), where the field was generated. The distance between the charge's position at \( t_r \) and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is represented by the vector \( \vec{d} \).
   - The static scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), but for a moving charge, relativistic corrections must be included. These corrections modify the denominator to account for the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and the propagation speed \( c \).
   - Option \( C \) introduces a denominator \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \), which correctly incorporates the relativistic effects. This ensures that the potential increases when the charge moves toward the observer (positive \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \)).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and depends on the same retarded time \( t_r \). It is influenced by the same denominator \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) as the scalar potential.
   - Option \( C \) provides \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), which aligns with the expected form of the vector potential for a moving charge.

3. **Comparison of Options:**
   - **Option \( A \):** Incorrect because it assumes \( \vec{A} \propto \vec{v}^2 \), which does not match the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \).
   - **Option \( B \):** Incorrect because it uses the static scalar potential \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), ignoring the relativistic corrections due to the charge's motion.
   - **Option \( D \):** Incorrect because the denominator \( (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) does not correctly account for the relativistic effects. When the charge moves toward the observer, the denominator increases, leading to an incorrect decrease in the potential.
   - **Option \( C \):** Correct because it incorporates the relativistic corrections in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), ensuring proper scaling with the charge's velocity and the propagation speed \( c \).

### Conclusion:
Option \( C \) provides the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, consistent with the retarded time formalism and relativistic corrections.
