Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem states that the system is in a state given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three-dimensional space, right? The state vector is either normalized or not—I should check that. To normalize, I need to find the magnitude. The elements are -1, 2, and 1. So magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. Oh, but maybe the problem doesn't worry about that? Or perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding. Hmm, right, because when calculating probabilities, the state needs to be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities won't add up to 1. So I should probably normalize it.

So the normalized state vector would be 1/sqrt(6) times (-1,2,1). Let me write that down: ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Then there are two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P is given. Let me write that out:

P matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And Q matrix:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

Wait, that's interesting. The Q matrix is diagonal. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are -1, 0, 1, but looking at the matrix, the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1. Wait no, the diagonal for Q is 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. So if you measure Q, you can get 1, 0, or -1. The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The problem asks: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the measurement order is first P, then Q. Wait, no, it's the other way around. Wait the question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is measure P first, then Q. So what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, it's in that new state. So the overall probability is the sum over all possible eigenstates of P that lead to the desired outcomes. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities in a specific order. First, find the probability of measuring 0 for P. Then, given that P was measured as 0, find the probability of measuring -1 for Q. Multiply these probabilities together to get the joint probability.

Wait, no. Because when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, which might not be an eigenstate of Q. So the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P, and then you measure Q on that state.

But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the measurement of P first gives 0, then Q gives -1. So I need to find the probability that P is 0, multiplied by the probability that Q is -1 given that P was 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability of the combined event: the system is in a state where P is 0 and Q is -1. But I'm not sure if these are compatible observables. Because if P and Q don't commute, their measurements are not independent. But wait, the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the measurement order is P first, then Q.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of P. But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation values or the probabilities directly.

Wait, perhaps to find the probability of getting 0 for P, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, project the state onto those eigenvectors, and sum the squares of the absolute values of those projections.

Wait, but P is a matrix, so perhaps it's not diagonal, making this more complicated. Let me try to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the matrix P and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues of P. The matrix is 3x3.

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

So to find the eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P-λI is:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Calculating the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - [1/sqrt(2) ] * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, but the third term is zero, so we can ignore it.

So determinant is:

-λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) ] 

Hmm, wait, perhaps I should compute the minors correctly.

Expanding the determinant:

= -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2), -λ] ) ) 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2); 0, -λ] ) )
+ 0 * det(...)

So the first minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix in the lower right when the first row and column are removed. The minor for the element at (1,1) is the 2x2 matrix:

[ [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ],
  [1/sqrt(2), -λ ] ]

So the determinant is ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/sqrt(2)) (1/sqrt(2)) ) = λ² - (1/2).

The second minor is the determinant for the (1,2) element. But since it's multiplied by (-1)^{1+2} = -1, but wait, the general expansion is sum_{j} (-1)^{i+j} M_ij * a_j. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to proceed step by step.

Wait, let's compute the determinant using the first row.

The determinant is:

(-λ) * ( (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) 

minus (1/sqrt(2)) * ( (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 )

plus 0 * (something).

So that's:

(-λ) [ λ² - 1/2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) - 0 ] 

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) )= (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ/sqrt(2)) ) = λ/(2)

So the determinant becomes:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

Wait, let me recheck that.

Wait, the second term in the determinant expansion is:

- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 

= - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) )

= - ( -λ/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )

= - ( -λ/2 )

= λ/2.

So the determinant is (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2.

Expanding [ (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) ] = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Adding λ/2: -λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the determinant equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Which factors as λ (-λ^2 + 1) )= 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ^2=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Ah, so the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

So the possible outcomes for P are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 for P.

So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to λ=0. Let's find them.

For λ=0, the matrix P - 0*I = P. So we have:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

We can write the system (P)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.

So the equations are:

1. (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

2. (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

3. (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → again v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0, v3= -v1, and v1 can be any scalar multiple. So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a), where a is a scalar.

So any vector like (1,0,-1) (or any multiple) is an eigenvector for λ=0.

But wait, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional? Because the equations give v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So any vector (v1, 0, -v1) is in the eigenspace. So yes, it's a one-dimensional eigenspace.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Now, the normalized eigenvectors would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) because the norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2, so sqrt(2) is the norm.

So the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but P might have other eigenvectors. Let me double-check. For λ=1 and λ=-1, the eigenvectors could be something else. But for this problem, perhaps I can proceed.

Now, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). Let's call this vector |ψ>.

The probability of getting 0 when measuring P is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector for λ=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

The inner product <v0 | ψ> is [ (1/sqrt(2)) , 0 , (-1/sqrt(2)) ] multiplied by ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

So compute this inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) / sqrt(6) + 0*(2)/sqrt(6) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1) / sqrt(6).

Simplify each term:

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ]

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → since sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).

So that's (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

But wait, let me double-check the eigenvector.

Wait, the eigenvector for P=0 is (1,0,-1), normalized as 1/sqrt(2), but when I compute the inner product with the state ψ, which is normalized as 1/sqrt(6) times (-1,2,1), the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 ) / sqrt(6)

Wait, no, wait. The state ψ is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector |v0> is [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * (2)/sqrt(6) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1)/sqrt(6)

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is 1/3. So yes, the probability is 1/3.

Now, given that we measured P=0, the state collapses into the eigenvector |v0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Now, we measure Q. What are the possible outcomes? Earlier, I saw that Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, the matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1.

So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

But wait, in the state |v0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2), what is the probability of measuring each Q outcome?

Well, the state |v0> can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of Q. Because Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, since Q is diagonal.

Wait, Q is represented by the matrix:

[
[1,0,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,0,-1]
]

So the eigenstates are |e1> = (1,0,0), |e2>=(0,1,0), |e3>=(0,0,1).

Because Q |e1> = 1 |e1>, Q |e2> = 0 |e2>, Q |e3> = (-1)|e3>.

Wait, but |e2> is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 0.

Now, our state |v0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + 0 |e2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.

So when we measure Q on this state, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1, each with probabilities given by the square of the coefficients in the eigenbasis of Q.

Wait, but |v0> is a linear combination of |e1> and |e3>, because the coefficients for |e2> is zero. So the state |v0> can be written as:

|v0> = (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + 0 |e2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.

So the probability of measuring Q=1 is |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2.

The probability of measuring Q=0 is |0|² =0.

The probability of measuring Q=-1 is | (-1/sqrt(2)) |² =1/2.

Wait, but in our case, we want the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0. So the probability is 1/2.

But wait, let's think again. Because the state after P=0 is |v0>, which is a normalized vector. So the probabilities for Q are:

- For outcome 1: (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

- For outcome 0: 0² =0.

- For outcome -1: (-1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1 and -1, each with 50% probability, and 0 is not possible in this case because the coefficient is zero.

Wait, but the state |v0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). So when we express this in the basis of Q's eigenstates (e1, e2, e3), the components are (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues corresponding to the non-zero components. So 1 and -1. So the probability of getting outcome -1 is 1/2.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the combined probability is the probability of P=0 (1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0 (1/2). But wait, because the state after P=0 is |v0>, which has a 1/2 chance of Q=-1.

So the joint probability would be (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

But wait, is that correct? Because when you measure P first, the state collapses to |v0>, and the measurement of Q is in that state. So the probabilities are multiplied.

So the probability is 1/3 (for P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (for Q=-1 given P=0), which gives 1/6.

But let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Another way: the combined event is that the system is projected into the eigenvector corresponding to P=0 and Q=-1. So let's find the projection onto the subspace where P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, but P and Q may not commute, so their joint eigenvectors might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P=0 is |v0>, and then measuring Q on that state gives the probabilities as I calculated.

So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the system's state and the measurements of the observables \( P \) and \( Q \). The system's initial state is given as the column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\), which is not normalized. Its norm is \(\sqrt{6}\), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). The eigenvalues are found to be \(\lambda = 0, 1, -1\). For \(\lambda = 0\), the eigenvectors satisfy the equations \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_3 = -v_1 \). Thus, the eigenvectors for \(\lambda = 0\) are of the form \((a, 0, -a)\). Normalizing, the eigenvector is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( -1 - 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \langle v_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \). Its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|e_1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |e_2\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |e_3\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The state after measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \), which can be expressed in the eigenbasis of \( Q \) as:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |e_1\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |e_3\rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the coefficient of \( |e_3\rangle \):

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Joint probability of \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \)
The joint probability is the product of the probability of \( P = 0 \) and the conditional probability of \( Q = -1 \) given \( P = 0 \):

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
