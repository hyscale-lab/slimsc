Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But given the next step is bromination in CCl4, that usually suggests an addition reaction, so I think it's propene. Because cyclopropane would undergo substitution, maybe? Wait, no, bromination of cyclopropane might be different. But more likely, since CCl4 is a solvent for addition in alkenes, I'll go with propene.

So, compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3). When it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a dibromination via the bromonium ion mechanism. For propene, adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, wait, actually, adding Br2 to propene (an alkene) would add across the double bond. So for propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, an E2 elimination. Since B has two adjacent Br atoms, eliminating two HBr molecules would form an alkene. Wait, but propene has three carbons. If we have 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr's would form propene again? Wait, but that would give 1,2-dibromopropane → (CH2BrCH2CH3) → wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. Eliminating HBr from both would give an alkene between C1 and C2, which would be propene again. But wait, could that be? Because if that's the case, then compound C would be propene, same as A. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Let me think again.

Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. Then, treating with alcoholic KOH: the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. Since the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form either 1,2-doubling (which isn't possible, as that would be between C1 and C2) or perhaps a different structure. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

Structure of B: Br is on C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

When treated with KOH (alcoholic), it undergoes elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so the H would be abstracted from either the same or the adjacent carbon. So let's say, H from C2 is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CHCH3, which is the same as compound A. But that can't be right because then C would be the same as A. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, no, because the Brs are on C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of the dibromide from propene would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, that can't be right. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCHBrCH3, right? So when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it's an E2 reaction. The base abstracts a β hydrogen from one of the Br-bearing carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So for 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating H from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CH2CH3 (propene). Alternatively, H from C3 could be abstracted if possible, but wait, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the possible H's for elimination are on C2 (since C1 and C2 have Br) and C3. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a different position.

Wait, let me think about the structure. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromopropane: the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) each have Br. So when KOH is used, elimination would occur between C1 and C2, forming a double bond between them. So the product would be CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again. But that would mean C is the same as A, which seems odd. But perhaps that's correct.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a different alkene. But in this case, with Br on C1 and C2, the only way to eliminate and form a double bond is between C1 and C2. So C would be propene. But then, the next step is passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube to produce D.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, could the initial bromination product be different? Maybe if the starting compound is cyclopropane. Let's think. Cyclopropane is C3H6. Bromination of cyclopropane in CCl4 might involve ring-opening. So adding Br2 to cyclopropane would probably lead to 1-bromo-1-propene or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps cyclopropane would undergo addition to form a dibromocyclopropane. But that's more of a substitution, perhaps. Hmm. But the initial step is likely to be propene adding Br2, so I'll proceed with that assumption.

So, compound C is propene. Then, passing it through a red-hot iron tube (which is a catalyst) would lead to what reaction? Oh, that's probably dehydrohalogenation or more likely, perhaps a hydrogenation reaction or some kind of rearrangement. Wait, no. Wait, propene is already an alkene, so passing through a red-hot iron tube—maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation? No, because that would add H2 and make propane. Or wait, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking or isomerization process.

Wait, another thought: passing an alkene through a red-hot iron tube could cause it to react, perhaps via a hydrogenation. Wait, but without H2, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but C is propene, which is an alkene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydration, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a polymerization reaction, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a process that converts an alkene into something else, like via a pinacol rearrangement or something similar. Or perhaps it's a hydrogenation using iron as a catalyst. Wait, but without H2, how would that happen? Maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: could compound C be something else? Let me go back. If B is 1,2-dibromopropane and reacts with alcoholic KOH, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different product. Wait, if the starting material is cyclopropane, then adding Br2 might give a different product, but I'm not as sure. Let's try to proceed.

So, assuming C is propene, then D is produced when it's passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the propene is being hydrogenated. But without H2, that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think. Another possibility: the reaction could be the formation of an alkyne. But to form an alkyne from an alkene, you need to eliminate another H2O or similar. But propene is CH2=CHCH3. To form an alkyne, perhaps it's a dihydrohalogenation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps compound C is butadiene or something else. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Maybe the initial reaction is different. If compound A is propene, and bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B), then treating with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules and form an alkene. But wait, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, it can eliminate HBr from each, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, giving back propene. So C is propene.

Then, D is produced when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe that's a hydrogenation catalyst, but without H2, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a different reaction, like dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction leading to an alkyne. Let me think: propene (CH2=CHCH3) could, under certain conditions, lose H2 to form propyne (HC≡CCH3). But I'm not sure about the conditions for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rearrangement reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of benzene from propene via a dehydrogenation, but that doesn't seem right. Because propene has three carbons, while benzene has six. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a reaction to form an alkyne. So, if C is propene, then D could be propyne. Let's assume that for a moment.

Propyne is HC≡CCH3. Then, D is propyne.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, strong acids—maybe concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, which could be conditions for nitration. So if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then nitration might occur. But where? Alkynes can undergo nitration, but the product would be a nitrated alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another angle: if D is propyne, and it reacts with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3), maybe it's undergoing a hydration reaction. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could undergo hydroboration to form ketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, acid-catalyzed hydration could form alcohols. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) upon hydration would form 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3), but I'm not sure about the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. But that would add two OH groups across the triple bond, forming a vicinal diol. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is propane. If C is propene, then passing through red-hot iron could hydrogenate it to propane. But without H2, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation of some other compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to outline each step again.

1. A → B: Propene (CH2=CHCH3) + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
2. B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination of two HBr, forming propene again. So C = propene.
3. C → D: Propene passed through red-hot iron → perhaps hydrogenation to propane? But without H2, not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation, but that would require losing H2. Wait, another possibility: the iron is causing the alkene to undergo a reaction, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction, but without a diene, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the propene is being oxidized. But oxidation of propene would typically form ketones (like propane-2-ol) or other products, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let me consider that compound A is cyclopropane (C3H6). Then, bromination in CCl4 would open the ring. Adding Br2 to cyclopropane typically gives 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it might eliminate to form a diene or something else.

Wait, but if A is cyclopropane, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then, elimination with alcoholic KOH would form cyclopropene or another structure. But I'm not sure about this pathway. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick with propene as A.

Let me proceed with the initial assumption.

So, C is propene. Then, D is formed by passing propene through a red-hot iron tube. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about what D is.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane. How? If propene is hydrogenated to propane using a catalyst like iron, but without H2, I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but without H2 in the system, that wouldn't happen. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the propene is being subjected to a dehydrogenation reaction, which would form an alkyne. So, D would be propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, E would be formed by reacting D with two strong acids. Let's say H2SO4 and HNO3. That's a mixture used for nitration.

So, if D is propyne, then E would be the nitration product. The triple bond is a good site for electrophilic substitution. So nitration would occur at the triple bond, perhaps. So the product would be 1-nitropropyne (but I'm not certain about the structure). Alternatively, the reaction might form an azo compound, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is hydration of the alkyne. If D is propyne, then in the presence of H2SO4, it could undergo hydration to form a ketone. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) would hydrate to form 2-propanol (CH3CHOHCH3), but I'm not sure about the conditions. Alternatively, if using HgSO4 as a catalyst, it would form a ketone. Wait, but the question says a mixture of two strong acids, which might include H2SO4 and HNO3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe D is propane, and E is formed by some reaction of propane with strong acids. But I don't see how propane would react with strong acids. That seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm off track. Let me think of the entire sequence again.

A is C3H6 → propene.

B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C is propene (after elimination).

D is formed by passing propene through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation to form propane. But without H2, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's a process to form an alkyne.

Wait, another idea: the iron tube might be a catalyst for the decomposition of propene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the propene is being converted into something else via a reaction with the iron.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, but how? Maybe the propene is being hydrogenated using the iron as a catalyst and H2 is present. But the question doesn't mention H2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the step that forms D is dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction path. Let's proceed further.

Assume D is propane. Then, E is formed by reacting D with two strong acids. So, perhaps E is propane sulfonated? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids, E would be the product of nitration. Let's say the alkyne is nitrated, leading to a nitropropyne. Then, F is formed when E reacts with iron scrap and HCl. That might be a reduction reaction, perhaps reducing the nitro group.

Wait, E could be 1-nitropropyne (maybe), then F would be the corresponding amine or amine derivative. Alternatively, when E reacts with Fe and HCl, it's a typical condition for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So if E is a nitro compound, F would be the corresponding amine.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid typically converts amines to diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions depending on conditions.

Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form H. So, perhaps H is a phenol or an aromatic compound.

But I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me try to outline the possible structures at each step.

A: Propene (CH2=CHCH3)
B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
C: Propene (after elimination)
D: Let's assume it's propyne (HC≡CCH3)
E: Nitropropyne (assuming nitration)
F: The amine after reduction (maybe CH2CH2CH3NH2, but that's not correct. Wait, the structure would be more like CH2CH2CH3NH2. Wait, perhaps more accurately, if E is HC≡CCH2NO2, then F would be HC≡CCH2NH2 after reduction.
G: Diazonium salt (when F reacts with nitrous acid)
H: Phenol derivative (when G is treated with NaOH)

Wait, but phenol would have a benzene ring. So perhaps D is benzene? No, that doesn't fit with the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off and should reevaluate.

Another approach: Let's list the compounds and their structures.

1. A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
3. C: Propene (CH2=CHCH3)
4. D: Assume it's propane (CH3CH2CH3) via hydrogenation.
5. E: Made by reacting propane with two strong acids. Hmm, but how? Perhaps a sulfonation, but that would require a catalyst and maybe a multi-step process.
Alternatively, perhaps E is formed via some other reaction. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Wait, perhaps D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, E is formed by reacting with two strong acids, like H2SO4 and HNO3. This could lead to nitration, so E would be 1-nitropropyne (HC≡CCH2NO2). Then, F is formed when E reacts with iron and HCl. Iron and HCl are conditions for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So F would be HC≡CCH2NH2.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically converts primary amines to diazonium salts, which can decompose. But in this case, F is a primary amine (HC≡CCH2NH2). Reacting with nitrous acid would form the diazonium salt, which is G. Then, when G is treated with NaOH, it could undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. So H would be a phenol derivative.

Wait, but the structure would have a benzene ring. Hmm. So perhaps during the reaction, the alkyne is converted into a benzene ring. But I'm not sure how that would happen here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to think about each option and see which statement is incorrect.

Options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. So F is some amine, and amines are often used as intermediates in dye synthesis. So A could be correct.

B) H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride test is for phenols. If H is a phenol, it would turn yellow. So if H is a phenol, B is correct.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. D is propane (CH3CH2CH3). The NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups. Wait, CH3CH2CH3 has all equivalent protons, so a single singlet. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect if D is propane. Alternatively, if D is something else, like propyne, its NMR would be different.

Wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. The protons on the CH3 group would be a singlet, and the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C2 (if any) would be on the sp-hybridized carbon, but in propyne, C2 has no H. So the structure is HC≡CCH3. The only H's are on the terminal CH3 group. So the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3. So D's NMR would be a singlet. But option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect. So if D is propane, its NMR is a singlet, but option C says two, which would be incorrect. So if option C is stating that D gives two singlets, that's incorrect, making option C the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let's see.

Wait, if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then in 1H NMR, the CH3 group is a singlet, and the triple bond doesn't have any protons. So only one singlet. So D's NMR is a single peak, so option C's statement that D gives two singlets would be incorrect.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about the structure of D. Let me think again about the reaction that forms D.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane (CH3CH2CH3). Propane has all equivalent CH3 groups, so the NMR would be a single singlet. So option C's statement about two singlets would be incorrect. Therefore, option C would be incorrect.

But wait, the question asks for the incorrect statement. So if option C is incorrect, that's a possibility.

Alternatively, let's proceed to option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas at room temperature, and it's flammable. So option D is correct. So option D's statement is correct, so it's not the incorrect statement.

So the incorrect statement is either B or C.

Wait, option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. So if H is a phenol, then yes. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, let me think about the sequence again.

If E is nitropropyne (HC≡CCH2NO2), then F is the amine (HC≡CCH2NH2). Then, G is the diazonium salt (HC≡CCH2N2+ Cl-). Then, when treated with NaOH, it would hydrolyze to form a phenol. The diazonium salt of a primary amine would typically form a phenol upon hydrolysis. So H would be a phenol, like phenol itself or a substituted phenol. So H reacting with FeCl3 would give a yellow precipitate (if it's phenol), so option B is correct.

Wait, but if H is phenol, then yes, B is correct. So the incorrect statement would be option C.

So, putting it all together:

The incorrect statement is option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. But if D is propane, it gives one singlet, or if D is propyne, it gives one singlet as well. Hence, option C is incorrect.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C3H6), which is identified as propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) as compound B. Treatment of B with alcoholic KOH leads to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, regenerating propene (CH2=CHCH3) as compound C.

When propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a dehydrohalogenation reaction to form propyne (HC≡CCH3) as compound D. Propyne is an alkyne, and its 1H NMR spectrum would show a single singlet corresponding to the CH3 group at the terminal position. Therefore, the statement that D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect.

Compound D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H2SO4 and HNO3), leading to nitration at the triple bond to form 1-nitropropyne (HC≡CCH2NO2) as compound E. When E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, the nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming HC≡CCH2NH2 as compound F. F is a primary amine, and amines are commonly used as intermediates in the synthesis of dyes, making statement A correct.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form a diazonium salt (HC≡CCH2N2+ Cl-) as compound G. When G is treated with sodium hydroxide, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol derivative as compound H. Phenols react with ferric chloride (FeCl3) to give a yellow precipitate, making statement B correct.

Finally, compound D (propyne) has the structure HC≡CCH3, and its 1H NMR spectrum would show only one singlet for the CH3 group. Therefore, the statement that D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect.

**Critical analysis of the options:**
- **A)** F is used for the synthesis of dyes. This is correct because primary amines are intermediates in dye synthesis.
- **B)** H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. This is correct because H is a phenol derivative, which reacts with FeCl3 to form a yellow precipitate.
- **C)** D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. This is incorrect because D (propyne) has only one set of equivalent protons (the CH3 group), resulting in a single singlet in its NMR spectrum.
- **D)** C is a flammable gas. This is correct because C (propene) is a flammable gas at room temperature.

The incorrect statement is **C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But given the next step is bromination in CCl4, that usually suggests an addition reaction, so I think it's propene. Because cyclopropane would undergo substitution, maybe? Wait, no, bromination of cyclopropane might be different. But more likely, since CCl4 is a solvent for addition in alkenes, I'll go with propene.

So, compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3). When it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a dibromination via the bromonium ion mechanism. For propene, adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, wait, actually, adding Br2 to propene (an alkene) would add across the double bond. So for propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, an E2 elimination. Since B has two adjacent Br atoms, eliminating two HBr molecules would form an alkene. Wait, but propene has three carbons. If we have 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr's would form propene again? Wait, but that would give 1,2-dibromopropane → (CH2BrCH2CH3) → wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. Eliminating HBr from both would give an alkene between C1 and C2, which would be propene again. But wait, could that be? Because if that's the case, then compound C would be propene, same as A. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Let me think again.

Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. Then, treating with alcoholic KOH: the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. Since the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form either 1,2-doubling (which isn't possible, as that would be between C1 and C2) or perhaps a different structure. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

Structure of B: Br is on C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

When treated with KOH (alcoholic), it undergoes elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so the H would be abstracted from either the same or the adjacent carbon. So let's say, H from C2 is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CHCH3, which is the same as compound A. But that can't be right because then C would be the same as A. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, no, because the Brs are on C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of the dibromide from propene would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, that can't be right. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCHBrCH3, right? So when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it's an E2 reaction. The base abstracts a β hydrogen from one of the Br-bearing carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So for 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating H from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CH2CH3 (propene). Alternatively, H from C3 could be abstracted if possible, but wait, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the possible H's for elimination are on C2 (since C1 and C2 have Br) and C3. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a different position.

Wait, let me think about the structure. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromopropane: the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) each have Br. So when KOH is used, elimination would occur between C1 and C2, forming a double bond between them. So the product would be CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again. But that would mean C is the same as A, which seems odd. But perhaps that's correct.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a different alkene. But in this case, with Br on C1 and C2, the only way to eliminate and form a double bond is between C1 and C2. So C would be propene. But then, the next step is passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube to produce D.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, could the initial bromination product be different? Maybe if the starting compound is cyclopropane. Let's think. Cyclopropane is C3H6. Bromination of cyclopropane in CCl4 might involve ring-opening. So adding Br2 to cyclopropane would probably lead to 1-bromo-1-propene or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps cyclopropane would undergo addition to form a dibromocyclopropane. But that's more of a substitution, perhaps. Hmm. But the initial step is likely to be propene adding Br2, so I'll proceed with that assumption.

So, compound C is propene. Then, passing it through a red-hot iron tube (which is a catalyst) would lead to what reaction? Oh, that's probably dehydrohalogenation or more likely, perhaps a hydrogenation reaction or some kind of rearrangement. Wait, no. Wait, propene is already an alkene, so passing through a red-hot iron tube—maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation? No, because that would add H2 and make propane. Or wait, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking or isomerization process.

Wait, another thought: passing an alkene through a red-hot iron tube could cause it to react, perhaps via a hydrogenation. Wait, but without H2, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but C is propene, which is an alkene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydration, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a polymerization reaction, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a process that converts an alkene into something else, like via a pinacol rearrangement or something similar. Or perhaps it's a hydrogenation using iron as a catalyst. Wait, but without H2, how would that happen? Maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: could compound C be something else? Let me go back. If B is 1,2-dibromopropane and reacts with alcoholic KOH, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different product. Wait, if the starting material is cyclopropane, then adding Br2 might give a different product, but I'm not as sure. Let's try to proceed.

So, assuming C is propene, then D is produced when it's passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the propene is being hydrogenated. But without H2, that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think. Another possibility: the reaction could be the formation of an alkyne. But to form an alkyne from an alkene, you need to eliminate another H2O or similar. But propene is CH2=CHCH3. To form an alkyne, perhaps it's a dihydrohalogenation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps compound C is butadiene or something else. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Maybe the initial reaction is different. If compound A is propene, and bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B), then treating with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules and form an alkene. But wait, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, it can eliminate HBr from each, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, giving back propene. So C is propene.

Then, D is produced when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe that's a hydrogenation catalyst, but without H2, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a different reaction, like dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction leading to an alkyne. Let me think: propene (CH2=CHCH3) could, under certain conditions, lose H2 to form propyne (HC≡CCH3). But I'm not sure about the conditions for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rearrangement reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of benzene from propene via a dehydrogenation, but that doesn't seem right. Because propene has three carbons, while benzene has six. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a reaction to form an alkyne. So, if C is propene, then D could be propyne. Let's assume that for a moment.

Propyne is HC≡CCH3. Then, D is propyne.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, strong acids—maybe concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, which could be conditions for nitration. So if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then nitration might occur. But where? Alkynes can undergo nitration, but the product would be a nitrated alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another angle: if D is propyne, and it reacts with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3), maybe it's undergoing a hydration reaction. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could undergo hydroboration to form ketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, acid-catalyzed hydration could form alcohols. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) upon hydration would form 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3), but I'm not sure about the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. But that would add two OH groups across the triple bond, forming a vicinal diol. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is propane. If C is propene, then passing through red-hot iron could hydrogenate it to propane. But without H2, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation of some other compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to outline each step again.

1. A → B: Propene (CH2=CHCH3) + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
2. B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination of two HBr, forming propene again. So C = propene.
3. C → D: Propene passed through red-hot iron → perhaps hydrogenation to propane? But without H2, not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation, but that would require losing H2. Wait, another possibility: the iron is causing the alkene to undergo a reaction, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction, but without a diene, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the propene is being oxidized. But oxidation of propene would typically form ketones (like propane-2-ol) or other products, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let me consider that compound A is cyclopropane (C3H6). Then, bromination in CCl4 would open the ring. Adding Br2 to cyclopropane typically gives 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it might eliminate to form a diene or something else.

Wait, but if A is cyclopropane, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then, elimination with alcoholic KOH would form cyclopropene or another structure. But I'm not sure about this pathway. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick with propene as A.

Let me proceed with the initial assumption.

So, C is propene. Then, D is formed by passing propene through a red-hot iron tube. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about what D is.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane. How? If propene is hydrogenated to propane using a catalyst like iron, but without H2, I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but without H2 in the system, that wouldn't happen. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the propene is being subjected to a dehydrogenation reaction, which would form an alkyne. So, D would be propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, E would be formed by reacting D with two strong acids. Let's say H2SO4 and HNO3. That's a mixture used for nitration.

So, if D is propyne, then E would be the nitration product. The triple bond is a good site for electrophilic substitution. So nitration would occur at the triple bond, perhaps. So the product would be 1-nitropropyne (but I'm not certain about the structure). Alternatively, the reaction might form an azo compound, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is hydration of the alkyne. If D is propyne, then in the presence of H2SO4, it could undergo hydration to form a ketone. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) would hydrate to form 2-propanol (CH3CHOHCH3), but I'm not sure about the conditions. Alternatively, if using HgSO4 as a catalyst, it would form a ketone. Wait, but the question says a mixture of two strong acids, which might include H2SO4 and HNO3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe D is propane, and E is formed by some reaction of propane with strong acids. But I don't see how propane would react with strong acids. That seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm off track. Let me think of the entire sequence again.

A is C3H6 → propene.

B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C is propene (after elimination).

D is formed by passing propene through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation to form propane. But without H2, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's a process to form an alkyne.

Wait, another idea: the iron tube might be a catalyst for the decomposition of propene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the propene is being converted into something else via a reaction with the iron.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, but how? Maybe the propene is being hydrogenated using the iron as a catalyst and H2 is present. But the question doesn't mention H2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the step that forms D is dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction path. Let's proceed further.

Assume D is propane. Then, E is formed by reacting D with two strong acids. So, perhaps E is propane sulfonated? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids, E would be the product of nitration. Let's say the alkyne is nitrated, leading to a nitropropyne. Then, F is formed when E reacts with iron scrap and HCl. That might be a reduction reaction, perhaps reducing the nitro group.

Wait, E could be 1-nitropropyne (maybe), then F would be the corresponding amine or amine derivative. Alternatively, when E reacts with Fe and HCl, it's a typical condition for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So if E is a nitro compound, F would be the corresponding amine.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid typically converts amines to diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions depending on conditions.

Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form H. So, perhaps H is a phenol or an aromatic compound.

But I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me try to outline the possible structures at each step.

A: Propene (CH2=CHCH3)
B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
C: Propene (after elimination)
D: Let's assume it's propyne (HC≡CCH3)
E: Nitropropyne (assuming nitration)
F: The amine after reduction (maybe CH2CH2CH3NH2, but that's not correct. Wait, the structure would be more like CH2CH2CH3NH2. Wait, perhaps more accurately, if E is HC≡CCH2NO2, then F would be HC≡CCH2NH2 after reduction.
G: Diazonium salt (when F reacts with nitrous acid)
H: Phenol derivative (when G is treated with NaOH)

Wait, but phenol would have a benzene ring. So perhaps D is benzene? No, that doesn't fit with the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off and should reevaluate.

Another approach: Let's list the compounds and their structures.

1. A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
3. C: Propene (CH2=CHCH3)
4. D: Assume it's propane (CH3CH2CH3) via hydrogenation.
5. E: Made by reacting propane with two strong acids. Hmm, but how? Perhaps a sulfonation, but that would require a catalyst and maybe a multi-step process.
Alternatively, perhaps E is formed via some other reaction. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Wait, perhaps D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, E is formed by reacting with two strong acids, like H2SO4 and HNO3. This could lead to nitration, so E would be 1-nitropropyne (HC≡CCH2NO2). Then, F is formed when E reacts with iron and HCl. Iron and HCl are conditions for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So F would be HC≡CCH2NH2.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically converts primary amines to diazonium salts, which can decompose. But in this case, F is a primary amine (HC≡CCH2NH2). Reacting with nitrous acid would form the diazonium salt, which is G. Then, when G is treated with NaOH, it could undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. So H would be a phenol derivative.

Wait, but the structure would have a benzene ring. Hmm. So perhaps during the reaction, the alkyne is converted into a benzene ring. But I'm not sure how that would happen here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to think about each option and see which statement is incorrect.

Options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. So F is some amine, and amines are often used as intermediates in dye synthesis. So A could be correct.

B) H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride test is for phenols. If H is a phenol, it would turn yellow. So if H is a phenol, B is correct.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. D is propane (CH3CH2CH3). The NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups. Wait, CH3CH2CH3 has all equivalent protons, so a single singlet. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect if D is propane. Alternatively, if D is something else, like propyne, its NMR would be different.

Wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. The protons on the CH3 group would be a singlet, and the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C2 (if any) would be on the sp-hybridized carbon, but in propyne, C2 has no H. So the structure is HC≡CCH3. The only H's are on the terminal CH3 group. So the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3. So D's NMR would be a singlet. But option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect. So if D is propane, its NMR is a singlet, but option C says two, which would be incorrect. So if option C is stating that D gives two singlets, that's incorrect, making option C the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let's see.

Wait, if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then in 1H NMR, the CH3 group is a singlet, and the triple bond doesn't have any protons. So only one singlet. So D's NMR is a single peak, so option C's statement that D gives two singlets would be incorrect.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about the structure of D. Let me think again about the reaction that forms D.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane (CH3CH2CH3). Propane has all equivalent CH3 groups, so the NMR would be a single singlet. So option C's statement about two singlets would be incorrect. Therefore, option C would be incorrect.

But wait, the question asks for the incorrect statement. So if option C is incorrect, that's a possibility.

Alternatively, let's proceed to option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas at room temperature, and it's flammable. So option D is correct. So option D's statement is correct, so it's not the incorrect statement.

So the incorrect statement is either B or C.

Wait, option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. So if H is a phenol, then yes. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, let me think about the sequence again.

If E is nitropropyne (HC≡CCH2NO2), then F is the amine (HC≡CCH2NH2). Then, G is the diazonium salt (HC≡CCH2N2+ Cl-). Then, when treated with NaOH, it would hydrolyze to form a phenol. The diazonium salt of a primary amine would typically form a phenol upon hydrolysis. So H would be a phenol, like phenol itself or a substituted phenol. So H reacting with FeCl3 would give a yellow precipitate (if it's phenol), so option B is correct.

Wait, but if H is phenol, then yes, B is correct. So the incorrect statement would be option C.

So, putting it all together:

The incorrect statement is option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. But if D is propane, it gives one singlet, or if D is propyne, it gives one singlet as well. Hence, option C is incorrect.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C3H6), which is identified as propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) as compound B. Treatment of B with alcoholic KOH leads to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, regenerating propene (CH2=CHCH3) as compound C.

When propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a dehydrohalogenation reaction to form propyne (HC≡CCH3) as compound D. Propyne is an alkyne, and its 1H NMR spectrum would show a single singlet corresponding to the CH3 group at the terminal position. Therefore, the statement that D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect.

Compound D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H2SO4 and HNO3), leading to nitration at the triple bond to form 1-nitropropyne (HC≡CCH2NO2) as compound E. When E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, the nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming HC≡CCH2NH2 as compound F. F is a primary amine, and amines are commonly used as intermediates in the synthesis of dyes, making statement A correct.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form a diazonium salt (HC≡CCH2N2+ Cl-) as compound G. When G is treated with sodium hydroxide, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol derivative as compound H. Phenols react with ferric chloride (FeCl3) to give a yellow precipitate, making statement B correct.

Finally, compound D (propyne) has the structure HC≡CCH3, and its 1H NMR spectrum would show only one singlet for the CH3 group. Therefore, the statement that D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect.

**Critical analysis of the options:**
- **A)** F is used for the synthesis of dyes. This is correct because primary amines are intermediates in dye synthesis.
- **B)** H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. This is correct because H is a phenol derivative, which reacts with FeCl3 to form a yellow precipitate.
- **C)** D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. This is incorrect because D (propyne) has only one set of equivalent protons (the CH3 group), resulting in a single singlet in its NMR spectrum.
- **D)** C is a flammable gas. This is correct because C (propene) is a flammable gas at room temperature.

The incorrect statement is **C**.

Answer: C
