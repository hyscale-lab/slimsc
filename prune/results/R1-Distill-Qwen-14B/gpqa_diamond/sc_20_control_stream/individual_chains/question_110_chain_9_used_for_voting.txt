Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties: RA, DEC, magnitude types (absolute or apparent), distance, and some have extinction (E(B-V)). I need to figure out which stars are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

First, I should recall what each spectrograph can observe in terms of magnitude. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the description says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So ESPRESSO observes stars with apparent V mag ≤ 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So anything with V mag less than or equal to 17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V mag ≤ 16 for HIRES.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go further but HIRES is more restrictive.

So the first step is to determine each star's apparent V magnitude. The absolute magnitude is given for some, others have apparent. Some might have extinction, which affects apparent magnitude.

Wait, the apparent magnitude is what's observed, but if there's extinction (dust, etc.), it makes the star appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So we might need to correct for extinction for some stars.

Wait, but the question says for Star3 and Star4, E(B-V) is given. And the note says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So that's the extinction in V, Av = R * E(B-V), where R is around 3.1. So for example, if E(B-V) is 0.6, then Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude is the observed magnitude, which is the intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction. Wait, wait, no. The formula is: apparent magnitude = absolute magnitude + distance modulus + extinction.

Wait, no, no. The absolute magnitude is M, the apparent is m. The distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. Then extinction (Av) is added to m to get the observed magnitude. Or wait, the observed magnitude is higher (dimmer) than the intrinsic because of extinction. So I think the formula is:

m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av

But wait, for a star, the apparent magnitude without extinction is m = M + 5 log(d/10). Then, if there's extinction, it becomes m_observed = m + Av.

Alternatively, sometimes, the extinction is considered as part of the distance modulus. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to compute each star's apparent magnitude as observed (with extinction) and then see if it's ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc.

Distance modulus: 5 log(10/10) = 5 log(1) = 0. So apparent magnitude (without extinction) is M + 0 = 15.5. But Star1's parameters don't mention any E(B-V), so I guess Av=0. So m = 15.5.

So for Star1, apparent V mag is 15.5. So it's below 16. So it can be detected by both? Wait: ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5 ≤16 → yes for HIRES, and also yes for ESPRESSO. So Star1 is observable by both.

Wait, but wait. Star1's DEC is -75 degrees. So it's in the southern celestial hemisphere. Paranal is in Chile, which is southern hemisphere, so it can observe that. Keck is in Hawaii, which is northern. So DEC of -75 is way south, so Keck would not be able to observe it because its declination is too far south. Oh! But the question says to disregard the pointing limits, so I don't have to worry about that. So the only thing is the apparent magnitude.

So Star1's apparent mag is 15.5, so it's detectable by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag of 16.5. HIRES can only go up to 16, so 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by HIRES, but ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 ≤17). So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V mag of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So extinction in V is Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So m_observed is 17.36.

So apparent magnitude is 17.36. For ESPRESSO, can detect up to 17, so 17.36 is too faint. So Star3's observed mag is 17.36, which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So Star3 can't be detected by ESPRESSO. Wait, but wait, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5—do I add the extinction or is that already the observed magnitude?

Wait, the star's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. So that's without considering extinction? Or is it including extinction? Because in the problem statement, Star3's data says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." Hmm, that's confusing. Because if E(B-V) is given, that suggests that the apparent magnitude is the observed (corrected) magnitude. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. The absolute magnitude M is the apparent magnitude the star would have at 10 pc, with no extinction. The apparent magnitude m is the observed brightness, including any extinction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The apparent magnitude m is what an observer measures, including any extinction. So if a star is at distance d, its intrinsic apparent mag (without extinction) would be M + 5 log(d/10). But if there's extinction Av, the observed m is higher (fainter) by Av.

Wait, but when given the apparent magnitude, do they give it as observed (with extinction) or the intrinsic (without)? That's the confusion here.

Looking back at the problem: For Star3, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So that suggests that the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is what the instrument would measure, including the extinction. Because if that's the case, then the extinction doesn't affect it further.

But wait, no, that would be odd because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is used to calculate the extinction. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and then we have to add the extinction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in Star3's case, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but because of the extinction, it appears dimmer. So the observed m is higher.

Wait, I think the correct approach is:

For a star, its apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = M + 5 log10(d/10). Then, the observed apparent magnitude m = m0 + Av.

So for Star3, M is given as 15.5? Wait, no. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which already includes any extinction? Or is it the other way?

Wait, no. Let's look at the problem statement again. The problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, so that includes extinction. Or is the apparent magnitude the theoretical one without extinction?

This is a bit ambiguous. Because in reality, when you observe a star, the apparent magnitude you measure includes the extinction. So for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the E(B-V) is 0.6. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but extinction is present, which makes it appear dimmer. So perhaps the 15.5 is the actual magnitude, and the E(B-V) is given just to calculate the effect. But that doesn't make sense because if you have extinction, the apparent magnitude would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify the approach.

Each star's apparent magnitude (as observed, including extinction) is what determines whether it's detectable.

For stars that are given an apparent magnitude (like Star2, Star3, and Star5), that's the observed magnitude, so we don't need to adjust for extinction. Wait, but Star3 has an E(B-V), so maybe the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to add Av to get the observed.

Wait, this is confusing. The problem says: "total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So Av = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So perhaps for stars with given E(B-V), the apparent magnitude would be M + distance modulus + Av.

But wait, for those stars where apparent magnitude is given (like Star2 and Star3), do they already include the extinction? Or is the given apparent magnitude the uncorrected one.

This is the crux. Let's think: for example, Star2's data: apparent V mag of 16.5, E(B-V) is not given. So perhaps Star2's apparent mag is 16.5, including any extinction. But Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps it's given as uncorrected, and we have to calculate the observed.

Wait, the problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". That suggests that the apparent magnitude is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is 0.6. So perhaps Star3's apparent mag is the observed one, but if that's the case, why give E(B-V) again? Hmm, maybe it's the other way: the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and E(B-V) is given to calculate the actual (observed) apparent magnitude.

Wait, I think I need to model this correctly. Let me think about each star.

For a star:

If the star’s apparent magnitude is given as m, and E(B-V) is provided, then the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m + Av.

But wait, no. Because m is already the observed (apparent) magnitude. So if E(B-V) is given, perhaps the star's m is the extinction-corrected (intrinsic) magnitude. Or perhaps not.

This is a bit muddling. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps for stars that have E(B-V), I need to calculate their observed apparent magnitude by adding the extinction. So the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to add Av to get the actual observed m.

Wait, but the problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So if the apparent mag is 15.5, which already includes the extinction, then the E(B-V) is redundant. Alternatively, if the apparent magnitude is 15.5 without extinction, and we have to add Av to get the observed.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another way.

Alternative approach: For each star, compute their apparent magnitude as observed (including any extinction). Then, check whether that apparent magnitude is ≤16 (for HIRES) and ≤17 (for ESPRESSO).

So for each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So distance modulus = 5 log(10/10) = 0. So m_intrinsic = M + distance modulus = 15.5. Since no E(B-V), Av=0. So m_observed =15.5.

HIRES: 15.5 ≤16 → yes. ESPRESSO: 15.5 ≤17 → yes. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: apparent V mag =16.5, E(B-V)=0 (since it's not given). So m_observed=16.5.

HIRES max is 16 → 16.5 is too faint. So Star2 can't be detected by HIRES. So only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=3.1*0.6=1.86. So m_observed = 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Check: 17.36 for both. HIRES can't see it (17.36>16), ESPRESSO can't either (17.36>17). So Star3 isn't detectable by either.

Wait, but that can't be right because Star3 is at 15 pc, which is not too far. Hmm, no. Wait, because the extinction is making it dimmer. Wait, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is without considering extinction. So when we add Av=1.86, the observed m becomes higher, making it fainter. So Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is beyond both instruments' capabilities. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Star4: Absolute V mag=15.5, d=10 pc. E(B-V)=0.4.

So compute. M=15.5, d=10 → distance modulus=0 → m_intrinsic=15.5.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74. So for HIRES (max 16), 16.74>16 → can't detect. For ESPRESSO (max 17), 16.74 <17 → can detect. So Star4 can be detected only by ESPRESSO.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when I compute m_observed, it's the apparent magnitude including extinction. So yes, Star4's observed m is 16.74.

Star5: Absolute V mag=16.5, d=5 pc. So compute m_intrinsic.

Distance modulus: 5 log(5/10) =5 log(0.5) =5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m_intrinsic= M + distance modulus =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 ≈15.0.

E(B-V) is not given, so Av=0. So m_observed=15.0.

So Star5's apparent mag is 15.0. So for HIRES: 15.0 ≤16 → yes. For ESPRESSO: 15.0 ≤17 → yes. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Star5's parameters: "absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance." So distance modulus is 5 * log(5/10) =5 * log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So m_intrinsic =16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995, ~15. So observed m is 15.0.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0. So both HIRES and ESPRESSO can observe it.

Now, let's recap:

Star1: detectable by both.

Star2: detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star3: not detectable by either.

Star4: detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: detectable by both.

Now, the question is which stars can be detected by both.

So looking at the stars:

Which stars have m_observed ≤16 (HIRES) and ≤17 (ESPRESSO).

Star1: m=15.5 → yes for both.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes for both.

So the possible options would be Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, so the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of them list Star1 and Star5. The options are:

A: 4 and 5

B:3 and5

C:2 and3

D:1 and4

Wait, so according to my analysis, the stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But none of the options include both. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated for Star5.

Wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance is 5 pc.

Distance modulus: 5 log(5/10) =5 log(0.5) =5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

So m_intrinsic=16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995, about 15.0.

So m_observed is 15.0, which is within both instruments.

So Star5 is detectable by both.

Which other star is detectable by both? Star1.

Wait, the options given don't pair Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given apparent magnitudes (like Star2 and Star3) are the observed, so no need to add extinction. Only for those stars that have absolute magnitudes and E(B-V) do I need to compute the observed m.

Wait, that could be.

Let me re-examine the problem:

The problem states:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc.

So for Star1, I need to compute apparent mag.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So Star2's m is already apparent (observed). So no extinction given, so Av=0. So m=16.5.

HIRES can't see it as 16.5>16.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the apparent mag is without extinction, so I need to add Av.

Alternatively, the apparent mag is the observed (so includes extinction), so E(B-V) doesn't affect it. Hmm, but that would be contradictory.

This is the crux of the confusion. Let me clarify:

- For stars with apparent magnitude given, it's the observed magnitude, already including any extinction. So if a star's apparent V is given as 15.5, that's what you measure, so no further correction is needed.

Wait, but Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V), so perhaps the apparent magnitude given is without extinction, and we have to compute the observed.

Wait, perhaps to avoid confusion, let's approach each star as follows:

For each star:

1. If the star's apparent magnitude is given, proceed with it as the observed m (so already including extinction). No E(B-V) is given, so Av=0.

2. If the star's absolute magnitude is given, along with distance and E(B-V), compute the observed apparent magnitude m_observed = M + distance modulus + Av.

So let's recompute each star:

Star1: absolute V=15.5, d=10 pc, no E(B-V).

Compute m_intrinsic: M + 5 log(10/10)=15.5.

Since no extinction, m_observed=15.5.

So Star1's m=15.5. Detectable by both.

Star2: apparent V=16.5, no E(B-V). So m_observed=16.5. HIRES can't see it.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V) is given, that suggests that the apparent magnitude is without extinction, and we have to add Av to get the observed.

But that would make sense only if the apparent magnitude given is the uncorrected one. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5 (without extinction), and the observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3's m_observed=17.36 → too faint for both.

Star4: absolute V=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute m_intrinsic: M + distance modulus =15.5 +0=15.5.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's m=16.74. HIRES can't see it (16.74>16). ESPRESSO can (16.74<17).

Star5: absolute V=16.5, d=5 pc. No E(B-V).

Compute m_intrinsic: M + distance modulus.

Distance modulus=5 log(5/10)=5 log(0.5)= -1.505.

m_intrinsic=16.5 + (-1.505)=15.0.

m_observed=15.0 (since no extinction).

So Star5's m=15.0. Detectable by both.

So now, which stars can be detected by both? Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0). So both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be seen by either.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → both can't be seen by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but according to this, Star1 and Star5 are the ones detectable by both. But none of the options include both. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star5. Let's double-check.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

Distance modulus:5 log(5/10)=5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

m_intrinsic= M + distance modulus → 16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 ≈15.0.

No extinction, so m_observed=15.0.

So Star5 is within both instruments' limits.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0).

So the correct answer would be these two stars. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that includes both. Hmm.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So none of the options include Star1 and Star5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1.

Star1's DEC is -75 degrees. HIRES is at Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which is in the northern hemisphere (latitude ~19°N). So declinations below about -30° might not be observable from Keck because of the observatory's latitude. But the problem says to disregard pointing limits, so that's not a factor.

So Star1's m_observed is 15.5. So detectable by both.

Star5's m=15.0. Detectable by both.

So the pair would be Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's calculation.

Wait, Star5: M=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Distance modulus:5 log (d/10) =5 log(5/10)=5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m_intrinsic=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So m_observed=14.995, which is indeed within both.

No, that's correct.

So the answer should be Star1 and Star5, but they are not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem considers that the apparent magnitude is the apparent without extinction, and for stars with E(B-V), we add the extinction to get the observed.

So, let's recompute for all stars:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. No E(B-V).

m_intrinsic=15.5. Observed m=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5, no E(B-V). Observed m=16.5.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4 → m_intrinsic=15.5, m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5. m_intrinsic=14.995, m_observed=15.0.

So after this, Star1's m=15.5, Star5's m=15.0.

Thus, both can be detected by both instruments. But in the options, the only possible correct pair is Star1 and Star5, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute m_observed. Maybe the given apparent magnitude for Star3 and Star5 is the observed (already including extinction), so I don't need to add anything else.

In that case:

Star3's m_observed=15.5. So Star3's m=15.5. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6. So if the given apparent magnitude is the observed, then the E(B-V) is extra information, but perhaps not needed. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps only stars with absolute magnitude and E(B-V) need to have their apparent magnitude calculated, while stars with given apparent magnitude are already as observed.

So let's try that approach.

For stars with absolute magnitude:

Compute m_observed = M + distance modulus + Av.

For stars with apparent magnitude: use as is.

So let's recalculate each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, no E(B-V). m=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5, no E(B-V). → m=16.5.

Star3: given m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → but I don't adjust anything because the given m is already observed. So m=15.5.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5, E(B-V)= not given, so Av=0.

m=16.5 + (distance modulus) → distance modulus=5 log(5/10)= -1.505.

So m=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 → 15.0.

So with this approach:

Star1: 15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2:16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3:15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4:16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5:15.0 → detectable by both.

So stars detectable by both: Star1, Star3, Star5.

Which of these are in the options? Let's look.

Option A: Star4 and 5 → only Star5 is in the correct.

Option B: Star3 and 5 → both are detectable by both.

So option B is possible.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the problem statement is ambiguous about whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not.

So, in this approach, Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable for both instruments.

So, with this approach, the correct pairs are:

Which stars are detectable by both:

Star1, Star3, Star5.

So looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable by both.

So in this scenario, if the given apparent magnitude is already the observed, including extinction, then Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

But earlier, when considering that the given apparent magnitude was the intrinsic, Star3's m would be 17.36, which is too faint.

So which approach is correct?

The problem states, for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

So it's a bit ambiguous, but perhaps E(B-V) is given even though the apparent magnitude is already including it. That would be odd, because E(B-V) is used to calculate the extinction, which affects the apparent magnitude.

Alternatively, the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and we must compute the observed.

But given the problem statement, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the observed m for all stars except those where the apparent magnitude is given.

Wait, wait, no, I'm getting more confused.

Alternative approach: the problem states that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude (corrected for extinction). So it's the observed magnitude. So no need to adjust for extinction. Thus, m=15.5.

So Star3's m=15.5, which is acceptable for both.

Same for Star5: if Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is acceptable for both.

In that case, the stars detectable by both would be Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

So looking at the options, the only option that includes two stars is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Thus, the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent magnitudes of the stars, considering the given constraints:

1. **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17 mag.  
2. **HIRES** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 16 mag.  
3. For stars with extinction (E(B-V)), the total absorption in the V band is calculated as \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) \), and this extinction is added to the intrinsic apparent magnitude to calculate the observed apparent magnitude.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0 \).  
- Distance modulus: \( 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 0 \).  
- Intrinsic apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + \text{distance modulus} = 15.5 \).  
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5 \), detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**  
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0 \).  
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{observed}} = m = 16.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.5 \), detectable only by ESPRESSO (not by HIRES).

#### **Star3**  
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
- Extinction: \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 \), not detectable by either ESPRESSO or HIRES.

#### **Star4**  
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
- Distance modulus: \( 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 0 \).  
- Intrinsic apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + \text{distance modulus} = 15.5 \).  
- Extinction: \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 \), detectable only by ESPRESSO (not by HIRES).

#### **Star5**  
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \), Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0 \).  
- Distance modulus: \( 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = -1.505 \).  
- Intrinsic apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + \text{distance modulus} = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 \).  
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 14.995 + 0 = 15.0 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 15.0 \), detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Determination:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES (\( m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5 \)).  
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO (\( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.5 \)).  
- **Star3**: Not detectable by either (\( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 \)).  
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO (\( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 \)).  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES (\( m_{\text{observed}} = 15.0 \)).
