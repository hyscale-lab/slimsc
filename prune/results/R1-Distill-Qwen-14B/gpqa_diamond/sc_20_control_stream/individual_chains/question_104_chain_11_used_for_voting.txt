Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits, and we detect this movement by shifts in the spectral lines.

So the problem says there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data here are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D, with numbers around 0.36, 1.4, 1.96, and 0.85.

Wait, I think the RV method's measured velocity (the Doppler shift) relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Let me recall the formula. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But more accurately, K depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) * (1 / (M_* )^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), but when inclination is 90 degrees, sin i is 1, and since the masses of the stars are the same and the planet masses are similar, maybe that's a clue.

Wait, the planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. The stars have the same mass, M_*, same as Sun. So the only variables here are the orbital periods and the semi-amplitude K.

Wait, but in the problem, K is different for each planet. K is the semi-amplitude shift measured, which is 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, milliangstrom is a unit of wavelength shift. But I think K is velocity, which is related to the Doppler shift in wavelength. The Doppler formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, so v = c * (Δλ/λ). But wait, the actual calculation might not require that because we can relate the velocities directly.

Wait, so Planet #1's K is v1, and Planet #2's K is v2. The RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. So, K is directly proportional to the velocity of the star. So, for each planet, K is given, but K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period. Because, I think the formula is K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, let me think again. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So K1 = (some constant) / P1^(1/3), and K2 = same constant / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Wait no, let me write it step by step. Let's define the formula for K for each planet.

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*) + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e is zero (circular orbit) and M_p << M_* (since Neptune is much less than the Sun), we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1) ) )

But since G, M_p, M_* are same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 is 1/( P1^(1/3) ) / (1/(P2^(1/3) )) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, so K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So if K1 is smaller than K2, then P2 must be longer than P1.

Wait the problem states that Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7. Wait, but the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So if the shift is larger, the velocity is higher. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, so K2 = 7 (maybe in some unit?), K1=5. So K2 > K1. How does that affect the periods?

From earlier, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1=5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, K is proportional to velocity. So if K2 is larger, the star's velocity is higher. Which would mean that P is shorter, because a higher velocity would mean a shorter orbital period (since the star is moving faster in its orbit, completing it quicker).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The orbital period is determined by the balance between the gravitational force and the orbital velocity. A larger velocity would mean a shorter period because the star is moving faster around the center of mass. So if K2 is bigger, P2 is shorter than P1. But according to the earlier equation, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. That would make the period of planet #2 shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times, which is about 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck. If P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is shorter, so the factor would be 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that when K is larger, the period is shorter. So if K2 is 7 and K1 is 5, meaning K2 is larger, so P2 is shorter.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so it's not longer. But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. Since it's shorter, the factor is less than 1. The options include A) ~0.36, which would mean that planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So the answer is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure about the formula. I think I might have mixed up the proportionality. Let me think again: K is velocity, which is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (P/(1 year)) )^(-1/3) ) ... Or perhaps, from Kepler's third law.

Wait, perhaps using the version of Kepler's third law for the RV method. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses. For a circular orbit, Kepler's law is P² = (4π² G(M_* + M_p)) a³ / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )

Wait, no, more accurately, Kepler's third law states that P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M_* + M_p) )

Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_* )

But how is this connected to the RV method? The RV method's semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity, which can be expressed as:

K = (2π a_p sin i) / P

Where a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and i is the inclination. Again, since i is 90 degrees, sin i is 1.

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4π² a_p³) / (G M_* )

So a_p = [ (G M_* P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting into K:

K = (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ]

Simplify that:

K = (2 π / P ) * [ ( G M_* )^(1/3) * (P^2)^(1/3) ) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

( P^2 )^(1/3 ) = P^(2/3 )

So:

K = (2 π ) / P * ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify:

= 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 - 1 ) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Wait, P is in the denominator as 1/P, and multiplied by P^(2/3), so 2/3 -1 = -1/3.

So:

K = 2 π (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(-1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

We can factor out the constants:

= [2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Simplify the constants:

Let me compute 4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, and π in numerator and denominator.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to write 2 as 2^(3/3) and 4 as 2^2, so 4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3).

So 2 π / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] = 2 π / [ (2^2 π² )^(1/3) ) ] = 2 π / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) )

Which is 2^(1 - 2/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So K = (2 π )^(1/3 ) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Combine all terms under the same exponent:

= [ (2 π G M_* ) / P ]^(1/3 )

So K = [ (2 π G M_* ) / P ]^(1/3 )

Which can be rearranged as:

K^3 = (2 π G M_* ) / P

So P = (2 π G M_* ) / K^3

But wait, since P is proportional to 1/(K^3 ), because G and M_* are constants.

So P1 = (2 π G M_* ) / K1^3

P2 = (2 π G M_* ) / K2^3

Taking the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3 ) / (K2^3 ) = (K1/K2 )^3

So, given that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, the ratio P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the host star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of this shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the star's mass. For circular orbits, the formula for \( K \) simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the two stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of their orbital periods can be determined from the ratio of their semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \). Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the relationship between the periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Wait no, let me write it step by step. Let's define the formula for K for each planet.

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*) + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since G, M_p, M_* are same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 is 1/( P1^(1/3) ) / (1/(P2^(1/3) )) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, so K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So if K1 is smaller than K2, then P2 must be longer than P1.

Wait the problem states that Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7. Wait, but the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So if the shift is larger, the velocity is higher. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, so K2 = 7 (maybe in some unit?), K1=5. So K2 > K1. How does that affect the periods?

From earlier, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1=5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, K is proportional to velocity. So if K2 is larger, the star's velocity is higher. Which would mean that P is shorter, because a higher velocity would mean a shorter orbital period (since the star is moving faster in its orbit, completing it quicker).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The orbital period is determined by the balance between the gravitational force and the orbital velocity. A larger velocity would mean a shorter period because the star is moving faster around the center of mass. So if K2 is bigger, P2 is shorter than P1. But according to the earlier equation, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. That would make the period of planet #2 shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times, which is about 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck. If P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is shorter, so the factor would be 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that when K is larger, the period is shorter. So if K2 is 7 and K1 is 5, meaning K2 is larger, so P2 is shorter.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so it's not longer.

The options include A) ~0.36, which would mean that planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So the answer is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure about the formula. I think I might have mixed up the proportionality. Let me think again: K is velocity, which is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (P/(1 year)) )^(-1/3) ) ... Or perhaps, from Kepler's third law.

Wait, perhaps using the version of Kepler's third law for the RV method. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses. For a circular orbit, Kepler's law is P² = (4π² G(M_* + M_p)) a³ / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )

Wait, no, more accurately, Kepler's third law states that P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M_* + M_p) )

Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_* )

But how is this connected to the RV method? The RV method's semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity, which can be expressed as:

K = (2π a_p sin i) / P

Where a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and i is the inclination. Again, since i is 90 degrees, sin i is 1.

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4π² a_p³) / (G M_* )

So a_p = [ (G M_* P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting into K:

K = (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ]

Simplify that:

K = (2 π / P ) * [ ( G M_* )^(1/3) * (P^2)^(1/3) ) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

( P^2 )^(1/3 ) = P^(2/3 )

So:

K = (2 π ) / P * ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify:

= 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 - 1 ) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Wait, P is in the denominator as 1/P, and multiplied by P^(2/3), so 2/3 -1 = -1/3.

So:

K = 2 π (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(-1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

We can factor out the constants:

= [2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Simplify the constants:

Let me compute 4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, and π in numerator and denominator.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to write 2 as 2^(3/3) and 4 as 2^2, so 4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3).

So 2 π / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] = 2 π / [ (2^2 π² )^(1/3) ) ] = 2 π / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) )

Which is 2^(1 - 2/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So K = (2 π )^(1/3 ) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Combine all terms under the same exponent:

= [ (2 π G M_* ) / P ]^(1/3 )

So K = [ (2 π G M_* ) / P ]^(1/3 )

Which can be rearranged as:

K^3 = (2 π G M_* ) / P

So P = (2 π G M_* ) / K^3

But wait, since P is proportional to 1/(K^3 ), because G and M_* are constants.

So P1 = (2 π G M_* ) / K1^3

P2 = (2 π G M_* ) / K2^3

Taking the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3 ) / (K2^3 ) = (K1/K2 )^3

So, given that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, the ratio P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

The semi-amplitude \( K \) of this shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the star's mass. For circular orbits, the formula for \( K \) simplifies to:

where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the two stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of their orbital periods can be determined from the ratio of their semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \). Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the relationship between the periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
