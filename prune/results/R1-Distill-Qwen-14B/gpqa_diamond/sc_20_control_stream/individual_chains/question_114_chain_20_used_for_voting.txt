Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, that's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile. Oh wait, in the presence of a ketone, sodium cyanide would typically do a nucleophilic addition. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so when a nucleophile attacks, it would add to the carbonyl carbon. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the cyanide added to the carbonyl, but then… Oh, wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. The butanenitrile part has four carbons, with the nitrile on the first carbon. Then, the 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would typically lead to (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait, no. Oh, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the molecule is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, both don't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)C(OH)(CH2CN)CH3? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, the general reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. So, the product should be a secondary alcohol adjacent to the nitrile group. So, for butan-2-one, adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? That would make it butanenitrile, but then the OH is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reaction with NaCN and a proton source. Oh, right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, right? Because the addition of CN- to ketones is typically done under acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So, the reaction is:

RCOR' + HCN (or CN-) → RCOH-R' with the OH and CN groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in this case, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, when adding HCN, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the starting ketone is different. Wait, butan-2-one is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a simple addition. Wait, but another possibility is that it's a substitution reaction, but I don't think that applies here. So, perhaps the reagent A is H3O+ (acid), because the addition of CN- would require protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic.

So, for the first part, the reagent A is H3O+ because it's an acid, which is option A or B or C or D. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So, if the first reaction requires an acid catalyst, then A is H3O+. So, the possible options are A, B, C, D, but only A and B have A as H3O+. So that's a clue.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + reagent B (H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, let me parse that. The starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. Then, after treatment with reagent B (in H2O), it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. How is that done? Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles can yield amides, acids, or other products, depending on the conditions.

If you have a nitrile and you treat it with strong acid and water, under reflux, it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using H2O with a strong acid catalyst. So, I think the reagent B is an acid catalyst, like HCl (HCl is a strong acid) or perhaps another acid like CH3COOH (which is a weak acid).

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B. The options given for B are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl, or CH3COOH. Let's see.

So, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So, when you add H2O and an acid, the nitrile (R-CN) would hydrolyze to R-COOH.

Wait, but wait, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but no, in this case, it's a nitrile and an alcohol on the same carbon.

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Let me think of the structure: the central carbon (the second carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a nitrile group (butanenitrile part), and two other substituents, which are the 4-benzylphenyl groups.

So, the structure might be:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, not exactly. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so butanenitrile has four carbons, with the CN on the first. So, the starting compound is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which would be:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)(CN)-CH2- something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but perhaps it's something like:

The main chain is four carbons, but the second carbon has both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group, and two substituents from the benzyl group.

But regardless, the main point is that the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid, which is typically done via hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

So, the reagent here is likely HCl (a strong acid) because the reaction would proceed via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but sometimes, when you have a nitrile with other functional groups, like an alcohol nearby, what happens? Could it be a different reaction, like oxidation? Because nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, but oxidation usually requires strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 under acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is in water with reagent B. So, perhaps it's a hydrolysis.

But wait, the first reaction uses A, which is H3O+ (from options A or B). Then, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O and another reagent. Or wait, the question says, for reaction two, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, no, no, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So, the reagent B is something in the presence of H2O.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

The second reaction is the product plus B, in H2O, to give another product.

So, the first reagent is A, and the second reagent is B, which is added along with H2O.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is a catalyst or a reagent that helps in the transformation.

The second reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So, what conditions are used for that?

Nitrile hydrolysis can occur under acidic, basic, or neutral conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, you use H2SO4, HCl, or another strong acid. For basic hydrolysis, you might use NaOH, KOH, and heat.

In this case, in the second reaction, reagent B is used with H2O. So, if it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, reagent B would be an acid, like HCl. If it's base-catalyzed, it would be something like NaOH, but that's not in the options.

Looking at the options for B:

Option A: B = HCl

Option B: B = CH3COOH

So, which one would be the correct reagent for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

I think acid catalyzed hydrolysis would require a strong acid. So, HCl (option A's B) seems more likely. Alternatively, sometimes, if the nitrile is in a position where the resulting acid is not stable (like beta-diketones), it can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the hydrolysis is straightforward.

So, for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl. That would correspond to option A (if A is H3O+) or option C (but option C's A is NaHSO3, which doesn't fit the first reaction).

Wait, but looking back at the options, let's list them again:

Options:

A) A=H3O+, B=HCl

B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

D) A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So, if in the first reaction, A is H3O+, then the options are A or B. Then, in the second reaction, B must be HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

So, for the second reaction, which reagent is better for nitrile to acid conversion?

I think HCl in H2O, under heat, is a common method for nitrile hydrolysis. So, reagent B would be HCl. So, option A would have B as HCl, which fits. 

So, putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B. So, the correct option would be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The product of the second reaction is a carboxylic acid, which requires the nitrile to be fully hydrolyzed. Another possible condition is using a strong acid and water. So, HCl is a strong acid, which would protonate the nitrile and facilitate the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, could it be that in the second reaction, the reagent is a base? No, because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is more likely under acidic conditions.

So, putting it all together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ (A) → cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). So, correct.

Second reaction: nitrile + H2O with HCl (B) → carboxylic acid.

So, the correct option is A, where A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure about the first reaction. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. How many carbons does that have? Let me count. Butanenitrile is four carbons, so butan-2-one has three carbons (since butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one? Wait, no, butan-2-one is actually (CH2)2CO, but I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:

Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Wait, but butan-2-one would have four carbons, with the ketone on C2. So, structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3, which is four carbons in total: CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. No, that's four carbons? Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, that's four carbons, but the ketone is on C2. So, yes, correct.

When NaCN is added in the presence of acid (H3O+), the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, that's three carbons. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the nomenclature wrong. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is correct as (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon compound. So, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product is given as 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is four carbons. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps butan-2-one is actually (CH2)2CO, which would be four carbons in total. So, butan-2-one is CH2CH2COCH3? No, that's not possible because that would be pentan-3-one or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the nitrile is on the first carbon, the hydroxyl and methyl are on the second. So, the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. So, the main chain is four carbons, with nitrile on C1, hydroxyl on C2, and methyl also on C2.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one. So, when you add CN, you get (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. So, the product given in the question is butanenitrile, which indicates four carbons. So perhaps the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which is four carbons. Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is: CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. So, it's four carbons with the ketone on C2. So, when you add CN, it would form (CH3)COCH2CH2CN? Or (CH3)CH(CO-OH)CN? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should move on and not get too bogged down in the structure.

The main point is that the first reaction uses an acid catalyst (H3O+), and the second uses HCl as the reagent. So, the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst (H₃O⁺) is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, reagent A must be H₃O⁺, which fits with options A and B.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid in the presence of reagent B and water. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a common method for this transformation, and a strong acid like HCl is typically used. Therefore, reagent B must be HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Options C and D are eliminated because they involve NaHSO₃ as reagent A, which is not suitable for the first reaction. Similarly, option B is eliminated because it uses CH₃COOH (acetic acid) as reagent B, which is not strong enough for efficient hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Thus, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponding to option A.
