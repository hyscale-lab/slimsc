Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let me see what I remember from my classes.

The question gives me some data about three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem, maybe it's just context.

The key data points are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2. Or wait, no, equilibrium temperature is inversely related to the square root of the distance from the star, right? Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ d^2 )) )^0.25. Or more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(d^2))^(1/4), but when L (the star's luminosity) is the same for all, which I think it is here because they're orbiting the same star, then T ∝ 1/(d)^0.5. Because ( (1/d²) )^(1/4) is (1/d)^(1/2). So T is proportional to 1 over the square root of distance.

So if Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, that would mean Planet1 is closer because higher temperature implies closer orbit. Because T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Wait, no, let me think again.

T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So T1 = T2 * sqrt(d2/d1). Hmm, maybe I should write the ratios more carefully.

Wait, let's denote T1 as Planet1's equilibrium temperature, T2 as Planet2's, T3 as Planet3's. The given ratios are T1/T2 ≈1.4 and T2/T3≈2.3. So T1 = 1.4 T2 and T2 = 2.3 T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = approx 3.22 T3.

But maybe it's easier to express the distances. Since T is proportional to (L/(16πσ d^2 ))^0.25. Wait, but L is the star's luminosity, which is same for all planets. So T is proportional to (1/d)^0.5. So d is proportional to (1/T)^2. Hmm, more precisely, d ∝ (1/T)^2. Wait, because T ∝ (1/d)^0.5, so d ∝ (1/T)^2.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's say T = T0 * (1/d)^(1/2), where T0 is a constant that includes the star's properties. So, T1 = T0 * (1/d1)^(1/2), T2 = T0 * (1/d2)^(1/2).

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). Because T1/T2 = (sqrt(1/d1)) / (sqrt(1/d2))) ) = sqrt( d2 / d1 ).

So given T1/T2 = 1.4. So sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4 → (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 ≈1.96 d1. So Planet2 is farther away than Planet1 by a factor of about 1.96.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So sqrt(d3/d2) = 2.3 → (d3/d2)= (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → d3 =5.29 d2.

So d3 =5.29 * d2 =5.29 *1.96 *d1 ≈ let me calculate that. 5.29 *1.96. Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So d3 ≈10.37 d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is roughly 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The question is asking by what factor P3 is larger than P1.

I remember Kepler's third law, which states that P² ∝ d³, but only when the mass of the star is much larger than the planet's. But in this case, I think the masses of the planets don't significantly affect the orbital period because the star's mass is so much larger. So Kepler's law is still applicable, approximately.

So P² ∝ d³ → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Wait, let's compute that. 10.37 squared is (approx) (10^2) =100, 0.37^2 is ~0.1369, but wait, wait: 10.37^3/2 = sqrt(10.37^3). Let me compute 10.37 cubed first.

Wait, 10.37^3 is 10.37 *10.37 *10.37. Let's compute step by step.

10.37 *10.37: 10 *10=100, 10 *0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, 0.37*0.37=0.1369. So 100 + 3.7 +3.7 +0.1369 = 107.5369.

Then 107.5369 *10.37 ≈ let me approximate.

100 *10.37 =1037.

7.5369 *10.37 ≈ 7*10=70, 7*0.37=2.59, 0.5369*10=5.369, 0.5369*.37≈0.198653. So 70+2.59=72.59, +5.369=77.959, +0.198≈78.157.

So total is 1037 +78.157 = 1115.157 approx.

So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.157. Then, sqrt(1115.157) is sqrt(1024)=32, but 1115 is 32^2=1024, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So sqrt(1115) is about 33.38 (since 33.38^2= approx 33^2=1089, 0.38^2=0.1444, but cross terms: 2*33*0.38=25.08. So 33.38^2 ≈ 1089 +25.08 + 0.1444= 1114.2244, which is a bit less than 1115. So sqrt(1115) ≈33.38 + (1115-1114.2244)/(2*33.38). The difference is about 0.7756. So 0.7756/(2*33.38)=0.7756/66.76≈0.0116. So sqrt≈33.38 +0.0116≈33.3916.

So P3/P1≈33.39, which is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because Kepler's law says P² ∝ (d³). So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2). So (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3) = sqrt(approx 1115) ≈33.4. So that's option D, which is ~33.4.

But wait, the question also gives the masses of the planets. The ratio of masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2's mass, and Planet3 is 1.35 times Planet2's. So Planet1 is 1.15 M2, Planet3 is 1.35 M2. So Planet3's mass is (1.35 /1.15) times Planet1's. Let me compute that: 1.35/1.15 ≈1.1739. So Planet3 is about 17% more massive than Planet1.

But wait, Kepler's law in the context of multiple planets is about the orbital period based on the star's mass and the planet's distance. The planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so the orbital period depends mainly on the distance and the star's mass. So the planet's mass shouldn't affect the period. So the mass data given might be a red herring, or perhaps I'm missing something.

But the question is about the orbital periods. So unless the mass affects the semi-major axis, but in reality, according to Kepler's law, the period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis, not the planet's mass. So I think the mass information is not directly relevant here, unless the question is implying that the planet's mass affects its orbital period through some other effect, but I don't think that's the case. Because in Kepler's law, it's the star's mass that dominates.

Wait, but if the planets are in a system where they're interacting, maybe the mass affects the TTV method they used to detect them. But the question is specifically about the orbital period, so I think the masses are extra information, perhaps to test if the examinee gets distracted.

So I think the calculation I did earlier holds. So the period ratio is about 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: write the equilibrium temperature formula.

The equilibrium temperature is given by T = (L/(16πσ d²))^0.25 * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), that factor is the same for each. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( d2/d1 ), as I thought earlier.

So from that, I found d2 ≈1.96 d1.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → d3 =5.29 d2=5.29 *1.96 d1 ≈10.37 d1.

Then orbital period P is proportional to d^(3/2).

So P3/P1= (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2) ≈33.39.

Which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio between the planets is provided, and the orbital period is proportional to the distance cubed under Kepler's law.

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \), where \( d \) is the orbital distance. Thus, the ratio of temperatures is related to the square root of the inverse distance ratio:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}}.
\]
From the given data:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 1.4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = 1.4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_2 \approx 1.96 d_1.
\]
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} \approx 2.3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} = 2.3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_3 \approx 5.29 d_2.
\]
Substituting \( d_2 \approx 1.96 d_1 \) into \( d_3 \approx 5.29 d_2 \):
\[
d_3 \approx 5.29 \times 1.96 d_1 \approx 10.37 d_1.
\]

### Step 2: Orbital period ratio
Kepler's third law states that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( d^{3/2} \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{d_3}{d_1} \approx 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}.
\]
First, calculate \( 10.37^{3/2} \):
\[
10.37^{3/2} = \sqrt{10.37^3}.
\]
Calculate \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 \approx 1115.16.
\]
Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1115.16} \approx 33.39.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.39.
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass data is not directly relevant to the calculation of orbital periods, as the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law.

So if Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, that would mean Planet1 is closer because higher temperature implies closer orbit. Because T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Wait, no, let me think again.

T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So T1 = T2 * sqrt(d2/d1). Hmm, maybe I should write the ratios more carefully.

Wait, let's denote T1 as Planet1's equilibrium temperature, T2 as Planet2's, T3 as Planet3's. The given ratios are T1/T2 ≈1.4 and T2/T3≈2.3. So T1 = 1.4 T2 and T2 = 2.3 T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = approx 3.22 T3.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's say T = T0 * (1/d)^(1/2), where T0 is a constant that includes the star's properties. So, T1 = T0 * (1/d1)^(1/2), T2 = T0 * (1/d2)^(1/2).

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). Because T1/T2 = (sqrt(1/d1)) / (sqrt(1/d2))) ) = sqrt( d2 / d1 ).

So given T1/T2 = 1.4. So sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4 → (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 ≈1.96 d1. So Planet2 is farther away than Planet1 by a factor of about 1.96.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So sqrt(d3/d2) = 2.3 → (d3/d2)= (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → d3 =5.29 d2.

So d3 =5.29 * d2 =5.29 *1.96 *d1 ≈ let me calculate that. 5.29 *1.96. Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So d3 ≈10.37 d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is roughly 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The question is asking by what factor P3 is larger than P1.

So P² ∝ d³ → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Wait, let's compute that. 10.37 squared is (approx) (10^2) =100, 0.37^2 is ~0.1369, but wait, wait: 10.37^3/2 = sqrt(10.37^3). Let me compute 10.37 cubed first.

Wait, 10.37^3 is 10.37 *10.37 *10.37. Let's compute step by step.

10.37 *10.37: 10 *10=100, 10 *0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, 0.37*0.37=0.1369. So 100 + 3.7 +3.7 +0.1369 = 107.5369.

Then 107.5369 *10.37 ≈ let me approximate.

100 *10.37 =1037.

7.5369 *10.37 ≈ 7*10=70, 7*0.37=2.59, 0.5369*10=5.369, 0.5369*.37≈0.198653. So 70+2.59=72.59, +5.369=77.959, +0.198≈78.157.

So total is 1037 +78.157 = 1115.157 approx.

So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.157. Then, sqrt(1115.157) is sqrt(1024)=32, but 1115 is 32^2=1024, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So sqrt(1115) is about 33.38 (since 33.38^2= approx 33^2=1089, 0.38^2=0.1444, but cross terms: 2*33*0.38=25.08. So 33.38^2 ≈ 1089 +25.08 + 0.1444= 1114.2244, which is a bit less than 1115. So sqrt(1115) ≈33.38 + (1115-1114.2244)/(2*33.38). The difference is about 0.7756. So 0.7756/(2*33.38)=0.7756/66.76≈0.0116. So sqrt≈33.38 +0.0116≈33.3916.

So P3/P1≈33.39, which is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because Kepler's law says P² ∝ (d³). So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2). So (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3) = sqrt(approx 1115) ≈33.4. So that's option D, which is ~33.4.

But wait, the question also gives the masses of the planets. The ratio of masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2's mass, and Planet3 is 1.35 times Planet2's. So Planet1 is 1.15 M2, Planet3 is 1.35 M2. So Planet3's mass is (1.35 /1.15) times Planet1's. Let me compute that: 1.35/1.15 ≈1.1739. So Planet3 is about 17% more massive than Planet1.

So from that, I found d2 ≈1.96 d1.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → d3 =5.29 d2=5.29 *1.96 d1 ≈10.37 d1.

Then orbital period P is proportional to d^(3/2).

So P3/P1= (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2) ≈33.39.

Which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio between the planets is provided, and the orbital period is proportional to the distance cubed under Kepler's law.

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \), where \( d \) is the orbital distance. Thus, the ratio of temperatures is related to the square root of the inverse distance ratio:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}}.
\]
From the given data:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 1.4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = 1.4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_2 \approx 1.96 d_1.
\]
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} \approx 2.3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} = 2.3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_3 \approx 5.29 d_2.
\]
Substituting \( d_2 \approx 1.96 d_1 \) into \( d_3 \approx 5.29 d_2 \):
\[
d_3 \approx 5.29 \times 1.96 d_1 \approx 10.37 d_1.
\]

### Step 2: Orbital period ratio
Kepler's third law states that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( d^{3/2} \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{d_3}{d_1} \approx 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}.
\]
First, calculate \( 10.37^{3/2} \):
\[
10.37^{3/2} = \sqrt{10.37^3}.
\]
Calculate \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 \approx 1115.16.
\]
Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1115.16} \approx 33.39.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.39.
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass data is not directly relevant to the calculation of orbital periods, as the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law.

**Answer: D**
