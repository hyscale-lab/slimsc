Okay, so I've got this question about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials and products. I'm a bit rusty on this reaction, but let me think through it step by step.

First, what do I remember about the Pinacol rearrangement? Pinacol is a molecule with two adjacent alcohol groups on a carbon chain, right? When it undergoes acid-catalyzed Pinacol rearrangement, one of the hydroxyl groups gets protonated. Then, a 1,2-hydride shift happens, leading to the formation of a ketone. The overall structure rearranges, usually forming a cyclic ketone if there's a suitable position for the ring formation.

Looking at the question, there are two reactions given. The first one is A + H2SO4 giving 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. The second is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 giving B. I need to find the correct options A and B.

Let's tackle the first reaction. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. Thatâ€™s a cyclohexanone ring where the 2-position has two p-tolyl groups attached, and the ketone is at position 1. So the molecule probably started as a pinacol, which under acid conditions rearranged.

The starting material A must be a diol, with two adjacent OH groups. Since the product is a cyclohexane ring, I think the diol was a 1,2-diol attached to a cyclohexane. Wait, or maybe it's the other way around. Let me imagine the structure.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol has two hydroxyls on adjacent carbons. When protonated, one of the OH leaves as water, generating a carbocation. Then a hydride (or an adjacent group) shifts, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic structure? Alternatively, maybe the diol is part of a larger ring. Let me think about the product again. The product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon (C2). So the starting material must have these two p-tolyl groups on adjacent positions, but in a structure that allows the rearrangement into a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting diol is 2,3-diol attached to a cyclohexane ring. Let me model it. Imagine a cyclohexane where one carbon has two p-tolyl groups attached, and the adjacent carbon has two hydroxyl groups. Wait, but that's a diol on adjacent carbons. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on position 2. So the starting material would have the two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon as one of the OH groups. Or, maybe the diol is on adjacent carbons, and upon rearrangement, those groups move into the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a pinacol where the two OHs are on a carbon that's adjacent to a carbon bearing two p-tolyl groups. Let me think: in the product, the two p-tolyl groups are on C2 of cyclohexanone, and the ketone is on C1.

So during the rearrangement, the diol (two OHs on adjacent carbons) would shift. The structure before would be something like a 1,2-diol where one of the OHs is on a carbon adjacent to a carbon that has two p-tolyl groups. So for example, if the diol was on C1 and C2 of a cyclohexane, but C2 has two p-tolyl groups. So the starting material A is 1,2-diol with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So when the acid is added, one OH gets protonated, becomes a good leaving group (water), and the adjacent carbon (C1) with the OH would form a carbocation. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C2 to C1, forming a carbonyl at C1. But wait, that might not form the cyclohexanone ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a 1,2-diol where the adjacent carbons are attached to a cyclohexane. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol where the two OHs are on a bridge between two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol derivative. For example, 1-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)cyclohexanol. But in this case, the phenyl groups would be p-tolyl. So structure-wise, the diol would have a cyclohexanol group, and an adjacent OH on a methyl group that's attached to two p-tolyl groups. So when the acid is added, the diol (two OHs on adjacent carbons) would lose water, form a carbocation, and then a hydride shift would occur, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, but in the product, the two p-tolyl groups are on the same carbon, so the starting material must have those two p-tolyl groups on one of the carbons adjacent to the OH groups.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a vicinal diol, like HO-R-CH2-CHOH-R', but in this case, R and R' are p-tolyl groups. So for the product, the rearrangement would form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a 2,3-diol attached to a cyclohexane. So, imagine a cyclohexane ring where the 2 and 3 positions are each bearing an OH group. When rearrangement occurs, perhaps a hydride shifts from position 3 to 2, forming a carbonyl at position 2. But I'm not sure that's right.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is part of a bridge structure. Let me think: if the starting material is a cyclohexanol with a substituent that has two p-tolyl groups and a diol structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the structure would be a cyclohexanol (OH on C1) and a methyl group attached to C1 as well, which has another OH and two p-tolyl groups. So the two OHs are on the same methyl group attached to C1 of the cyclohexane. So the structure would be something like this: cyclohexanol with a CH(OH)(C6H4-para-tolyl)2 group on C1.

When H2SO4 is added, the diol (two adjacent OHs on the same carbon) would undergo acid-catalyzed rearrangement. So one OH gets protonated, becomes a good leaving group (water), forming a carbocation on that same carbon. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon, which in this case is the cyclohexane C1.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the molecule: the methyl group attached to C1 of cyclohexane has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the structure is CH(OH)(C6H4-p-tolyl)2. So it's a geminal diol (two OHs on same C?), wait no, wait. Wait, no, if it's 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, then the structure is:

The cyclohexane has OH on C1. Then, attached to C1 is a CH2 group, which has another OH and two p-tolyl groups. So the structure is:

Cyclohexanol (OH on C1) with a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group attached to C1. So the two OHs are on adjacent carbons: C1 has OH and a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group.

Wait, no. The formula for A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. Let me parse that. The main chain is cyclohexanol (cyclohexan-1-ol). Then, the substituent is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group attached to C1. So the substituent is a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl group and two p-tolyl groups attached. Wait, so the substituent is CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2.

So the structure is a cyclohexanol ring with a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group attached to the same carbon (C1) as the OH. So the two adjacent OHs are on C1 (from the cyclohexanol) and on the substituent's OH on the same CH group.

Wait, no. The substituent is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group. So that would be a -CH2-OH group attached to two p-tolyl groups. Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl. That would be a methyl group (CH2-) attached to two p-tolyl groups and a hydroxyl group. So it's CH2-OH with two p-tolyl groups attached to the same carbon? Or is it -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2?

Wait, the substituent is hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl. So, that's a methyl group (-CH2-) attached to two p-tolyl groups and a hydroxyl group. So the group is CH(OH)(C6H4-p-tolyl)2?

Wait, no, the substituent is hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl, which is a methyl group attached to two p-tolyl groups and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is CH2(OH)(p-tolyl)2? No, because that would require three substituents on a CH2 group, which isn't possible. So perhaps it's a CH group with two p-tolyl groups, an OH, and the substituent attached to the cyclohexane.

Ah, wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2. So the structure is:

Cyclohexan-1-ol with a substituent at C1: a CH group that has an OH and two p-tolyl groups. So structure:

O
|
C6H11-C-OH (from cyclohexanol)
|
CH(OH)(C6H4-p-tolyl)2

Wait, no. The substituent is attached to the cyclohexane's C1. So the C1 has two substituents: the OH (from cyclohexanol) and the CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group.

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, cyclohexane's C1 has the OH, and the substituent is a -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group. So the structure would be:

Cyclohexane: C1 has OH, and a CH2 group attached? Or perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group attached directly to C1.

Wait, maybe the structure is as follows: the main ring is cyclohexane, with an OH on C1. Also, on C1, there's a substituent which is a CH group that has another OH and two p-tolyl groups attached. So C1 has the ring, the OH, and the CH group. The CH group has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the structure would be:

Cyclohexan-1-ol, with a substituent at C1 being a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group.

Now, when this undergoes acid treatment, the diol (the two OH groups on adjacent carbons) will rearrange. So one OH (say, the substituent's OH) will be protonated, leading to the loss of water as a leaving group, forming a carbocation on the same carbon as the substituent's OH was. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon (which is the cyclohexane's C1) to the carbocation, forming a new carbonyl group.

Wait, but the substituent's OH is on a CH group attached to C1. Let me think in terms of the rearrangement. So, the diol has two OHs: one on the cyclohexane's C1 (from cyclohexanol) and another on the adjacent CH group's OH.

Wait, no. The substituent is a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group attached to C1. So the two OHs are on the same carbon (the substituent's carbon). So it's a geminal diol (two OHs on same carbon). Wait, that can't be right because the Pinacol rearrangement typically involves vicinal diols (two OHs on adjacent carbons), not geminal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a 1,2-diol, meaning the OHs are on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe the structure is more like cyclohexanol with a 2-substituted diol group attached. For instance, the substituent is a CH2-CHOH-CH2- group, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,2-diol attached to a cyclohexane. Let me think: the product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So the starting diol must have the two OHs adjacent to each other, with one of them attached to a carbon that has two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the diol is on a bridge or a side chain. Let me try to draw this out mentally.

Suppose the starting material is a cyclohexanol where one of the adjacent carbons has a diol group attached. For example, C1 has an OH (cyclohexanol), and the adjacent C2 has another OH and a substituent with two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, that would make a vicinal diol (OH on C1 and C2), but then the substituent on C2 would have two p-tolyl groups. So the structure would be something like cyclohexane with OH on C1 and C2, and C2 also has a CH2 group attached to two p-tolyl groups.

But wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a molecule where two adjacent carbons each have an OH group, and one of those carbons is connected to a bridge that brings in two p-tolyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is part of a bicyclic structure. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let me think about the product again. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on C1, and C2 has two p-tolyl groups.

In the rearrangement, the diol loses a water molecule, forming a carbocation. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of the ketone. So the carbocation must have been on a carbon adjacent to where the ketone forms.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol where one of the OHs is on a carbon that has two p-tolyl groups attached. So when the diol rearranges, the carbocation forms on that carbon, and then a hydride shift occurs from an adjacent carbon (like the cyclohexane) to form the ketone.

Wait, but if the diol is on a carbon that's attached to two p-tolyl groups, then after losing water, the carbocation would be on that same carbon. Then, a hydride shift from the cyclohexane's C1 would form the ketone on the same carbon, resulting in the two p-tolyl groups being on C2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Diol (A) has two adjacent OH groups.
2. Acid protonates one OH, making it a good leaving group (water leaves).
3. Carbocation forms on the carbon where the OH was.
4. Hydride shift from an adjacent carbon to the carbocation, forming a double bond, which then becomes a carbonyl group (ketone).
5. The structure rearranges, forming the ketone and the ring.

So in the product, the ketone is at position 1 of cyclohexane, and the two p-tolyl groups are at position 2.

So the starting material must have the two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon as one of the OH groups, and the other OH is on an adjacent carbon. When the rearrangement happens, the carbocation forms on the OH-bearing carbon, and a hydride shifts from the adjacent carbon (which is part of the cyclohexane) to form the ketone on that carbon, resulting in the cyclohexanone with the two p-tolyl groups on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, so the starting material would have the two p-tolyl groups on a carbon that's adjacent to another OH. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexanol with a side chain that has a diol group. For example, the cyclohexanol's C1 has an OH, and the adjacent C2 has a CH group that has another OH and two p-tolyl groups.

So the structure would be:

Cyclohexane ring with OH on C1, and C2 has a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group. So the diol is between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would make it a vicinal diol, which is correct for the Pinacol rearrangement.

So in this case, under acid conditions, the diol would lose water from C1, form a carbocation on C1. Then, a hydride shift from C2 would occur. But wait, C2 in this case is attached to the CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group. So a hydride shift from C2 to C1 would form a carbonyl on C1, making cyclohexanone, and the substituent on C2 would have the two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, but the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2. So that suggests that during the rearrangement, the substituent (two p-tolyl groups) moves from C2 to C2, which is adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting material as a diol where one OH is on a substituent attached to the cyclohexane, and the other OH is on the cyclohexane itself. So, when the rearrangement occurs, the substituent's OH and the cyclohexane OH form the diol.

Wait, but looking at the options, the starting material A is given as either 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol or cyclopentan-1-ol with similar substituents.

So the options for A are either cyclohexan-1-ol or cyclopentan-1-ol, with a substituent of hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl.

So for the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the starting material must be a cyclohexanol derivative. So looking at the options, options A and D have cyclohexan-1-ol as starting material A.

So options A and D are possible for the first reaction.

Now, for the second reaction: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 â†’ B.

The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2-OH ? No, wait, perhaps I should structure it correctly.

Wait, but butanoate is four carbons. So structure: the ester group (COOCH3) is on C4. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2(CO-OCH3) attached to something else. Wait, wait, the formula is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, but with substituents.

The structure would be: the butanoate is in the form CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-something. Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.

The formula is 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So butanoate is four carbons: COOCH3 attached to C4. The substituents are at C2 and C3.

Wait, the structure would be:

COOCH3 is on C4. C2 has a p-tolyl group and two hydroxyl groups? No, wait, the substituents are at C2 and C3.

Wait, 2-(p-tolyl) means a p-tolyl group is attached to C2. 2,3-dihydroxy means OH groups are on C2 and C3.

So the structure is:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl)

C3: CH(OH)

C4: COOCH3

So the molecule is:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3

But wait, that can't be because the substituents on C2 would make it a diol on C2 and C3, which are adjacent.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So when acid is added, this diol (on C2 and C3) would undergo the Pinacol rearrangement.

So the diol is on C2 and C3. The acid would protonate one OH, leading to the loss of water and formation of a carbocation on C2. Then, a hydride shift from C3 to C2 would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but since the diol is on C2 and C3, the rearrangement would form a ketone on either C2 or C3, depending on where the hydride shifts.

Alternatively, the 1,2-hydride shift could occur from C3 to C2, leading to a carbonyl on C3, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in the Pinacol rearrangement, after the loss of water, the carbocation forms on the more substituted carbon. Then, the hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon to the more substituted one to form the most stable carbocation, which then becomes the carbonyl.

But in this case, the diol is on C2 and C3. The C2 has a p-tolyl group and an OH, and C3 has an OH and a CH2 group connected to COOCH3.

So when the diol is protonated, the loss of water forms a carbocation on either C2 or C3. Which is more favorable? Well, C2 has a p-tolyl group, which is a bulky substituent. So it's more likely that the carbocation forms on C2, which is more substituted.

So, the reaction would proceed by protonating C2's OH, leading to the formation of a carbocation on C2. Then, a hydride shift from C3 to C2 occurs, turning the C2 into a carbonyl group. The resulting structure would have a ketone on C2, and the p-tolyl group remains on C2.

Wait, but let me think about the connectivity. The starting material is:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

After rearrangement, the structure becomes:

CH2- C(O) (from the carbonyl) - CH2 - COOCH3, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of connectivity.

So, the diol is on C2 and C3.

Upon losing water from C2, the carbocation is at C2. Then, a hydride from C3 shifts to C2, which would form a carbonyl group on C2.

So the new structure would be:

CH2-C(O)-CH2-COOCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached to C2.

Wait, but the p-tolyl was on C2 in the starting material.

Wait, no. Let me detail the steps.

Original structure:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3

Protonation on C2's OH:

CH2-CH(OH+)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3

Loss of water (H2O) from C2:

CH2+-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3

Now, the carbocation is at C2.

Then, a hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2.

So, the H from C3's CH(OH) moves to C2.

After the hydride shift:

CH2-CH(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2+- COOCH3

Wait, but that leaves a carbocation on C3? Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong.

Alternatively, the hydride shift moves from C3 to C2, forming a double bond, which then becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure after shift is:

CH2-CH(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, but that would form a carbonyl at C2. So the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which is option B in the options.

Wait, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. The product after rearrangement would have a ketone at C3, I think.

Wait, let me think again. In the starting material, the diol is on C2 and C3. After the rearrangement, the carbocation is on C2, and the hydride shifts from C3 to C2. So the new structure would have a carbonyl group at C2, and C3 would have a CH2 group.

But wait, the starting material is CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

After the shift, the structure would be:

CH2-C(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3.

But wait, that would mean the ketone is on C2, and the p-tolyl is attached to C2.

So the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, since the carbonyl is on C3? Wait, no. Wait, the butanoate has four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4.

If the ketone is on C2, then the product would be 2-oxo-... butanoate? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the starting material's structure is:

COOCH3 is on C4.

C3 is connected to C2. So:

C4: COOCH3

C3: CH(OH)

C2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl)

C1: CH2-

After rearrangement, the ketone forms at C2, so the structure becomes:

C4: COOCH3

C3: CH2

C2: C(O)(p-tolyl)

C1: CH2-

So the product would be:

CH2-C(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3 â†’ methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Wait, no, because in butanoate, the carbonyl is on C1, but if the ketone is on C2, then the position is 2-oxo, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IUPAC name for the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Because the ketone is on C3.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me number the carbons:

The butanoate is four carbons: COOCH3 is on C4 (the first carbon is the COOCH3, but no, wait, the carbonyl is on C1. Wait, no, butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, butanoate is RCOOCH3, where R is butyl. So in this case, the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, numbering from the COOCH3 end:

C4: COOCH3

C3: CH(OH)

C2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl)

C1: CH2-

After rearrangement, the carbonyl is on C3. So the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So the product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Looking at the options, options A and B have this as product B.

So for the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, so the starting material must be a cyclohexanol derivative with a diol substituent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D: A = same as A, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Wait, the second reaction's product in option A is the same as what I thought, but option D has a different product.

So, for reaction one, the starting material A must be 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A or D.

Reaction two's product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which is option A or B.

So now, looking at the options:

Option A: A is cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option B: A is cyclopentan-1-ol, B is same as A.

Option C: A is cyclopentan-1-ol, B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo... etc.

Option D: A is cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 2-methyl... etc.

So for the first reaction, product is cyclohexanone derivative, so A must be a cyclohexanol derivative. So options A and D are possible.

For the second reaction, the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which is option A and B.

So in the options, only option A has both A as cyclohexan-1-ol and B as the correct product.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves the conversion of a vicinal diol into a ketone under acidic conditions, proceeding through protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, and a 1,2-hydride shift. The question involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct starting materials and products.

### Reaction 1:  
**A + Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„ â†’ 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**  
The product is a cyclohexanone derivative with a ketone at position 1 and two p-tolyl groups at position 2. The starting material must be a vicinal diol with two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, one of which is attached to a carbon bearing two p-tolyl groups. This matches the structure of **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**, where the diol is on C1 and C2 of the cyclohexane ring. Under acidic conditions, the rearrangement forms the ketone at C1 and retains the two p-tolyl groups at C2, consistent with the product.

### Reaction 2:  
**Methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„ â†’ B**  
The starting material is a butanoate ester with hydroxyl groups on C2 and C3, and a p-tolyl group on C2. Under acidic conditions, the diol undergoes rearrangement: protonation of one hydroxyl group leads to the loss of water and formation of a carbocation on C2. A hydride shift from C3 to C2 forms a ketone at C2, resulting in the product **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.

### Option Analysis:  
- **Option A**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.  
  This matches both reactions, as the starting material for Reaction 1 is a cyclohexanol derivative, and the product for Reaction 2 is consistent with the rearrangement.  

- **Option B**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.  
  The starting material for Reaction 1 is a cyclopentanol derivative, which does not match the product (a cyclohexanone derivative).  

- **Option C**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.  
  The starting material for Reaction 1 is incorrect, and the product for Reaction 2 does not match the expected rearrangement.  

- **Option D**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.  
  The starting material for Reaction 1 is correct, but the product for Reaction 2 is incorrect, as the rearrangement does not introduce a methyl group at C2.  

### Conclusion:  
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it correctly identifies the starting materials and products for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
