Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about the yield of the para-isomer for six different benzene derivatives when they undergo bromination. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the least para yield first, and the highest last.

First, I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. They can be either activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

So, let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating group because it's an alkyl group. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the para position is a major product, along with ortho.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This is phenyl ester, specifically ethyl benzoate. The COOEt group is a substituent. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. Wait, but wait. Wait, the ester group has a lone pair on the oxygen. Hmm, but I think esters are deactivating. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the substituent is meta directing. Wait, no. Wait, ester groups are actually a bit tricky. Let me think: the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring less reactive. Also, since it's an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), it should be a meta director. So for substitution, the incoming electrophile would go to meta positions.

3) C6H5-Cl: This is chlorobenzene. Cl is a substituent. Chlorine is slightly deactivating because of its electronegativity; however, it's an ortho/para director due to its lone pairs. Because Cl has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making ortho and para positions more activated, even though it's deactivating overall (because the inductive effect is stronger than the resonance effect for Cl). So in chlorobenzene, the para product is major.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong deactivating group. It's a meta director. So the nitro group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So in nitrobenzene's bromination, the para product won't form much; instead, meta is major.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating group, similar to methyl. It's an ortho/para director. So the bromine would add mostly to ortho and para positions, with para being a major product.

6) C6H5-COOH: This is benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong deactivating group (due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group). It's a meta director. So when brominating benzoic acid, the para product is not favored. Instead, meta is major.

Wait, but wait: some substituents have different directing effects. Let me make sure I'm correct about each.

1. Methyl: activating, ortho/para. So para is major.

2. Ester (COOEt): deactivating, meta director.

3. Cl: deactivating, but ortho/para. So para is a major product.

4. NO2: deactivating, meta. So para is minor.

5. Ethyl: activating, ortho/para. So para is major.

6. COOH: deactivating, meta. So para is minor.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, what's the percentage of para product?

But wait, some substituents may lead to more or less para product. So for example, if the substituent is a strong activating group, the para might be a major product, perhaps with ortho being the other main product.

But for deactivating groups, if they are meta directors, then para is not a major product. However, for some substituents, even though they are deactivating, they are ortho/para directors, like Cl. So when Cl is present, the para product is a major, but when it's a meta director, like NO2 or COOH, the para is not a major.

Wait, but the problem is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the order is from least to most. So, to arrange the substances in the order of increasing weight fraction of para.

So, let's list each:

1) Toluene (methyl): ortho/para, so para is a major product. Let's say the para is like 30-40%? Or maybe higher. Wait, in toluene substitution, the para isomer is the major, but so is ortho. Wait, wait, when the substituent is a strong activating group, the para product is more than meta, but in some cases, ortho is even more than para because of steric reasons. Hmm, but in general, for a simple activating group like methyl, the bromine can go to ortho, para, but para is more favored than meta. But I might be getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituent's effect. For each substituent, the para product's weight fraction.

Let me think about each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): activating, ortho/para. So the para is a major product, but the ortho is even more? No, wait. Wait, for toluene, the para substitution is possible, but steric hindrance might make ortho less favored than para, but wait, that's not right. I think in toluene bromination, the para is the major product because the ortho position is more hindered. Or is it the opposite? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, when you have an activating group, the ring is more reactive. The substituent's presence directs the incoming electrophile. For methyl, which is an activating group, the para is a major product. But wait, what about the yields? Let me think. For toluene bromination, the major products are para and ortho. Ortho might be more substituted, but due to steric hindrance, para is more favored. Wait, no, some sources say that for toluene, para is the major product, but ortho is also significant. But in any case, the para product is more than meta, but for our problem, we are looking at the para fraction relative to others. So, toluene would have a higher para fraction compared to substituents that are meta directors.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): ester group. Since it's deactivating and meta director, the para isomer would be less. So, the para product would be minor, perhaps like 10% or less.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. So the para product is major. So for chlorobenzene, the para is a large fraction, maybe around 50-60% or higher.

4) C6H5-NO2: strong deactivating, meta director. So the para product is minor. So, low para fraction.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): ethyl is activating, ortho/para. So para is a major product, similar to toluene.

6) C6H5-COOH: strong deactivating, meta director. So para product is minor.

So, for each substance, the para fraction (assuming only one major product aside from substituent effect):

1) High (para is major)
2) Low
3) High (para is major)
4) Low
5) High (para is major)
6) Low

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For the substituents that are meta directors, the para product won't form much, but for ortho/para directors, the para is a major.

Wait, so which substituents are directing to para? Let's list:

Substituent | Director | Para?
--- | --- | ---
CH3 | ortho/para | yes, major
COOEt | meta | no
Cl | ortho/para | yes, major
NO2 | meta | no
C2H5 | ortho/para | yes, major
COOH | meta | no

So, the para product is major when the substituent is ortho/para director (for activating groups like CH3, Cl, C2H5), and minor when substituent is meta director (COOEt, NO2, COOH).

Now, the weight fraction of para would be higher for substituents that are ortho/para directors. But how much? Also, some substituents may influence the para yield more than others.

Wait, but some substituents may have more influence. For example, Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director. So in chlorobenzene, the para product is major.

So, the order from least to greatest para fraction (increasing):

Substances 2,4,6 have meta directors, so their para fractions are low.

Substances 1,3,5 have ortho/para directors, so their para fractions are higher.

So, the lowest para fractions are substances 2,4,6. The highest are 1,3,5.

Now, between the meta directors, which have the least para fraction? Well, all of them have less, but perhaps the substituent's effect varies.

Wait, another point: in some cases, the substituent can make the ring so deactivating that the para product is not formed, but for others, even with deactivation, the para product is possible but less than meta.

But maybe it's better to think about the relative activating strength. For substituents with strong deactivation, the ring's reactivity is lower, but the directing effect determines where the substitution occurs.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, regardless of the overall reactivity. So, for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not formed much, but some might have more than others.

Wait, but wait. Let's think for substituents that are meta directors. For example:

- COOEt: ester. It's deactivating but perhaps less so than nitro or COOH groups.

- NO2: strong deactivating.

- COOH: also a strong deactivating.

So, for the meta directors, how much para product is formed? Well, in the case of meta directors, the para substitution is not favored. So all of them have low para fractions, but maybe the order is based on how strong the meta-directing is.

But how does that affect the para fraction? Hmm. Maybe I should think about which substituents are more deactivating, which could affect the possibility of substitution? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups (ortho/para) have higher para fractions, and the deactivating groups have lower. So among the ortho/para directors, which have methyl, ethyl, and Cl.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction for these is as follows:

Cl is deactivating but can donate electrons via resonance, but perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para product is significant. So, for Cl, the para fraction is higher than for activating groups? Or is it lower?

Wait, methyl is activating, so the ring is more reactive. So the reaction is more likely, so the para product is more. For Cl, which is deactivating but ortho/para, the ring is less reactive, but the directing effect makes the para position a major site.

So, perhaps the para fractions for 1,3,5 are higher than 2,4,6.

But among the ortho/para directors, what's the order of para fractions?

Wait, toluene (1): methyl is activating, so high para.

Chlorobenzene (3): Cl is deactivating but still ortho/para. So para is a major product, but perhaps less than toluene.

Ethylbenzene (5): ethyl is activating, similar to methyl, so para is major.

Wait, but for toluene, the para might be more than chlorobenzene because the ring is more reactive. So 1 (toluene) > 3 (Cl) > 5 (ethyl)? Or perhaps 3's para is higher than 5's?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should consider the relative activating strengths. Alkyl groups are activating, and the more bulky the group, the more the para product because ortho is hindered.

Wait, ethyl is bigger than methyl, perhaps making para more favored. So ethylbenzene would have more para product than toluene? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think in toluene substitution, the para is the major product because the ortho is more hindered. Similarly, for ethylbenzene, the para would be major too. So perhaps 1,3,5 have significant para fractions, but their order depends on substituent strength.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps all of 1,3,5 have higher para fractions than 2,4,6.

Now, looking at the options, the options have different orders. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

So, the order from least to most para fraction is: 4 (NO2), 2 (COOEt),6 (COOH),3 (Cl),1 (CH3),5 (C2H5).

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3

So, 4,6,2 are least, then 1,5,3.

Wait, but if 3 has a higher para fraction, then it would come after 5 in this case.

But I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the weight fraction of the para product, so for each substituent, how much para product is formed.

Let me think about each substance:

1) Toluene (CH3): activating, ortho/para. So para is major. So weight fraction is high.

2) Ethyl benzoate (COOEt): deactivating, meta. So para is minor.

3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): deactivating, ortho/para. Para is major, but less than toluene because the ring is less reactive, but the directing is ortho/para.

Wait, but the ring's reactivity affects how much substitution occurs, but the question is about the fraction of para isomer among the products. So, if the ring is less reactive (due to deactivation), perhaps the substitution is less, but the para fraction is as per the directing.

Wait, perhaps this is more about the directing effect than about the reactivity. So, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a major fraction, regardless of activation.

So, for 1,3,5: each has a significant para fraction. For 2,4,6: low.

So, the order should be 2,4,6 having low, and 1,3,5 high.

But how to arrange the low ones (2,4,6) and the high ones (1,3,5)?

Wait, the question is about the increasing order. So we start with the lowest, then go up.

Looking at the substituents:

The meta directors are 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH).

Which of these has the least para fraction? Since all are meta directors, their para fractions would be low, but which is the lowest? Well, perhaps the strongest deactivating groups have the least para product. Or maybe the substituents that are more deactivating have lower reaction rates, but the question is about the proportion of para, not the overall yield.

Wait, but perhaps the meta directors don't influence para much. Let's say that all meta directors have a lower para fraction, but how to order them.

Wait, maybe the substituents that are more deactivating (like NO2 and COOH) might have even lower para fractions than COOEt.

Wait, for example:

Substance 4 (NO2): very strong deactivating, so the ring is not reactive. But since it's a meta director, the para product is negligible.

Substance 6 (COOH): also strong deactivating, meta director. Para product is negligible.

Substance 2 (COOEt): deactivating, but perhaps less than NO2 and COOH. So, perhaps its para fraction is higher than 4 and 6, but still low.

Wait, but this seems counterintuitive. Wait, if the substituent is more deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so when bromination occurs, the para product (if possible) may be less. But in the case of meta directors, the para product is not formed much regardless.

Hmm, perhaps the order of the meta directors is based on how strong their deactivating effect is. The stronger the deactivating, the less the possibility for substitution, but in the case of meta directors, substitution doesn't go to para anyway.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think about which substituent would lead to the least para product. So, if a substituent is both strong deactivating and meta-directing, the para product would be almost zero. So, substituents 4 (nitro) and 6 (COOH) would have lower para fractions than 2 (COOEt), which is less deactivating.

So, the order of meta directors from least to most para fraction would be 4 <6 <2. Because nitro is stronger deactivating than COOH, which is stronger than COOEt? Wait, no, wait, I think the order of deactivating strength is: NO2 > COOH > COOR.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think: The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, stronger than carboxylic acid. And the ester group is less deactivating than both. Because the nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than the carboxylic acid, which in turn is more than the ester. So, the order in deactivating strength is: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, for the meta directors, the one with the strongest deactivating effect (NO2) would have the least para product. Then comes COOH, then COOEt.

So, the order would be 4 <6 <2.

Now, the ortho/para directors: 1 (CH3),3 (Cl),5 (C2H5).

Which of these have higher para fractions? All are ortho/para directors, so their para fractions are higher. Now, the question is whether their para fraction is in the order of 3 <1<5, or 1 <3<5, or any other.

Wait, but which substituent leads to a higher para fraction. Let's think about the substituent's effect.

Methyl is a strong activating group, so substitution is more likely, and the para product is a major one.

Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. So, the substitution is less likely, but para is a major product.

Ethyl is activating, so substitution is easier, and para is a major product.

So, perhaps the para fractions for 1,3,5 are in the order 5>1>3.

Wait, why? Because ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, activating groups increase the rate of reaction, making the ring more reactive. So, for a stronger activating group, substitution is more favorable, and the para product is a higher fraction because the ring is more reactive, making substitution possible in positions that are more hindered.

Alternatively, perhaps the more activating the group, the more the para product is favored.

Wait, methyl is an activating group, but less so than ethyl? Or is ethyl a stronger activating group than methyl?

Wait, ethyl is a larger group, so perhaps it makes the ring more activated but also causes more steric hindrance in the ortho position, favoring para.

Alternatively, the activation effect is due to alkyl groups donating electrons via induction. So, larger groups donate more, making the ring more activated. But steric effects could cause more para substitution.

Hmm, perhaps ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl. So, ethylbenzene (5) would have a higher para fraction than toluene (1), which in turn is higher than chlorobenzene (3), which is deactivating.

Wait, but chlorobenzene is deactivating. So perhaps the para fraction is less than toluene and ethylbenzene, but more than the meta directors.

Wait, but Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. So, the ring is less reactive than toluene or ethylbenzene, so the para product is a major fraction but smaller than in the activating groups.

So, the order of para fractions for 1,3,5 would be 5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl). Because ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl, leading to higher para fraction.

Putting it all together, the overall order from least to most para fraction would be:

Meta directors: 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt).

Ortho/para directors:3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Wait, no. Wait, for the ortho/para directors, their para fractions are higher than meta directors. So, the overall order would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. No, that's 4, then 2, then6, etc.

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. Wait, that's 4,6,2, then 1,5,3.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, ortho/para directors have higher para fractions than meta directors, so the order would be 4,6,2, then 3,1,5.

Wait, no. Because 3,1,5 are ortho/para, so their para fractions are higher than 2, but lower than each other?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ordering. Let me re-express.

The overall order should be:

Lowest para fraction first: 4 (NO2, meta), then 6 (COOH, meta), then 2 (COOEt, meta), then the ortho/para ones in increasing order. Wait, but 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para but deactivating. So, the para fraction for 3 is less than for 1 and 5.

So the correct order would be:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Wait, this would be option C? Let me check option C.

Option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3

No, option C says 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. Which would place 3 at the end. But according to my reasoning, 3 is less than 1 and 5.

Wait, no, in my earlier reasoning, the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have higher para fractions than meta directors (2,4,6). So the order from least to most:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Is this an option?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, because 3 is after 5.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But looking at the options, I don't see this order.

Wait, let me double-check the options.

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4, 2,6,3,1,5.

Option B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 → 6 comes first.

Option C)4<6<2<1<5<3 → 4,6,2, then 1,5,3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the para fractions for 1,3,5 aren't in the order 5>1>3. Maybe Cl (3) is higher than 1 and 5.

Wait, no. Because Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, which would mean that the para product is formed less than in toluene or ethylbenzene.

So, the order of ortho/para directors: 5 (C2H5) >1 (CH3) >3 (Cl).

So, the overall order from least to most para would be:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

But in the options, this is not present.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No, because 6 is after 2.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the meta directors.

Wait, perhaps the order of meta directors is 2 <4 <6. Because COOEt is less deactivating than NO2 and COOH.

So, the order of meta directors is 2 (COOEt) has higher para fraction than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH). So their para fractions are: 2 >4 >6, but all are low.

Wait, but that would mean that 2's para fraction is higher than 4 and 6. So the para fractions for meta directors are 6 <4 <2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because COOEt is less deactivating than NO2 and COOH. So the ring is more reactive for COOEt than for NO2 or COOH. So when brominating, the para product is more likely (though still not as much as ortho/para directors), so 2 would have higher para fraction than 4 and 6.

So the order of meta directors from least to most para fractions:6 <4 <2.

Wait, so the meta directors order is 6 <4 <2.

And the ortho/para directors:3 <1 <5.

So, the full order is:

6 (COOH) <4 (NO2) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

But looking at the options, none have this exact order.

Wait, let's check the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → So 6,2,4,5,1,3.

No, this doesn't match.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the relative directing effects and reactivity.

The para fraction is influenced by both directing effect and activating/deactivating nature.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para product. So, for meta directors, the para product is not formed much. So, their para fractions are lower than those of ortho/para directors.

So, among the meta directors, the order of para fraction would be 2 (COOEt) >4 (NO2) >6 (COOH), because the substituents' deactivating effects are in that order: COOEt (least deactivating) > NO2 (more deactivating) > COOH (most deactivating). So, the para fractions for meta directors: 2 is higher than 4 and 6.

So, for meta directors, the order from least to most para fraction is6 <4 <2.

For ortho/para directors, the order is from least to most:3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So, the overall order is:

6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none match this exactly.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Hmm, none of the options match this order. So perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent's ability to direct affects the para fraction. So, for ortho/para directors, the para fraction is higher, but for meta directors, it's lower.

So, the correct order would be:

meta directors in increasing order of para fraction (which would be in order of their deactivating strength, from highest to lowest—so 6 (COOH) <4 (NO2) <2 (COOEt)) → meaning 6 has the least para, then4, then2.

And ortho/para directors would have higher para fractions. So their order is 3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So, the full order is:

6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I have to look for the option that starts with 4<6<2<… which is option C.

Wait, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Hmm, but according to my reasoning, 3 (Cl) should come after 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the actual order of the para fractions is:

For ortho/para directors, the para fractions are 3 (Cl) >1 (methyl) >5 (ethyl). No, that doesn't make sense because Cl is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the actual products.

Wait, for nitrobenzene (4), the para product is minimal. For benzoic acid (6), same. For ethyl benzoate (2), same.

Chlorobenzene (3): major product is para.

Toluene (1): major product is para.

Ethylbenzene (5): major product is para.

So, the order of para fraction would be from lowest to highest: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none have this. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but I must choose the best possible option.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the substituents' effects.

Wait, perhaps the order for the ortho/para directors is 3 (Cl) <5 (C2H5) <1 (CH3).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because methyl is stronger activating than ethyl? No, ethyl is larger, so perhaps more activating.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction for ethylbenzene (5) is higher than toluene (1), which is higher than chlorobenzene (3).

So, the order for ortho/para directors is3 <1 <5.

So, the full order is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So, the order in the options would be option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → no.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and the correct order is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But according to my reasoning, 3 (Cl) should be before 1 and 5. So, option C ends with 3, which is correct.

Wait, no. Option C has 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So, 3 is last, which is higher than 5, which doesn't align with my earlier reasoning.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer among the options.

Wait, another approach: The question asks for the order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

So, the substance with the least para fraction comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Which implies:

4: least para.

Then 2, then6, then3, then1, then5: most.

Does this make sense? Let's think.

4 is nitro, meta director → para fraction is low.

2 is COOEt, meta → para is low but higher than 4 and 6?

Wait, if 2 has a higher para fraction than 4 and6, then in option A, 4 comes before 2, which would mean 4 has lower para than 2. That would be correct if 2 has higher para fraction than 4.

But wait, 2 is COOEt, which is less deactivating than nitro and COOH. So, para fraction for 2 is higher than 4 and6. So in the order, 4 <6 <2.

So, option A's order is 4 <2 <6, which would be wrong because para fraction for 2 is higher than both 4 and6.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But no option matches.

Looking again, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the para product in each.

Another thought: some substituents can have steric effects that influence where substitution occurs. For example, a bulky group may favor para substitution more because the ortho positions are hindered.

So, ethyl group is bulkier than methyl, so in ethylbenzene, para product is favored more than in toluene.

So para fraction: 5 >1 >3.

But 3 is Cl, which is less bulky than ethyl.

Wait, but Cl is a small substituent, so in chlorobenzene, the ortho and para are both accessible, so para is a major product. But since the ring is less reactive (due to Cl being deactivating), perhaps the para fraction is less than toluene and ethylbenzene.

So, the order of para fractions for ortho/para directors is 5>1>3.

So, the overall order would be:

4 (NO2: lowest) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5: highest).

So, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none have this exact order. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but perhaps the intended option is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitration or sulfonation directing effects. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is option A. Let me think.

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

So, the order is 4 (NO2) <2 (COOEt) <6 (COOH) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

But according to my earlier reasoning, 6 (COOH) should come before 4 and 2. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the meta directors' para fractions are in the order 2 >4>6.

So their order would be 6 <4 <2.

And the ortho/para directors:3 <1 <5.

So, the overall order is 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But that would place 3 (Cl) at the end, which I thought shouldn't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the para fractions of substituents. Let me think about the possibility that nitro group (4) has the least para fraction, followed by COOH (6), then COOEt (2), then Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then C2H5 (5).

So, the order is4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

No option matches this.

Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But according to my analysis, 2's para fraction is higher than 4 and6, so it should come after them.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: looking for the correct answer, I'll think about the options.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

In this order, 4 is the lowest. Then 6, then 2, then 1, then5, then3.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the para fraction of 3 (Cl) is higher than 1 and5, which are ortho/para directors. So this order would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the order is indeed option C. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of possible para products. For example, in some cases, the substituent might have more than one possible para position.

Wait, no, each substituent is in a single position on the benzene ring, so each substitution would only have one para position.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct order is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4. Which is option D.

But according to my reasoning, 3 is an ortho/para director, so it should have a higher para fraction than the meta directors.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think of the para fractions:

- 4 (NO2): meta director → low para.
- 6 (COOH): meta → low, but higher than 4.
- 2 (COOEt): meta → higher than 4 and6.
- 3 (Cl): ortho/para → higher para than meta directors, but lower than activating groups.
- 1 (CH3): activating → higher para than 3.
-5 (C2H5): activating → highest para.

So, order:4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ease of substitution, but no, the question is about the weight fraction of the para product.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct order is 4,6,2,3,1,5, which isn't an option, but perhaps the correct option is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct order is option A.

But I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should choose option C as the answer.

The problem involves determining the order of substances 1-6 based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. The analysis hinges on the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring, which can be activating or deactivating and ortho/para or meta directors. The goal is to arrange the substances in increasing order of the para-isomer yield.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Activating Groups (Ortho/Para Directors)**: Substituents like CH₃ (methyl), C₂H₅ (ethyl), and Cl (chlorine) are ortho/para directors. These groups increase the reactivity of the benzene ring and favor substitution at the ortho and para positions. Among these, CH₃ and C₂H₅ are activating, while Cl is deactivating but still an ortho/para director due to resonance effects.
   - **Deactivating Groups (Meta Directors)**: Substituents like COOEt (ester), NO₂ (nitro), and COOH (carboxylic acid) are meta directors. These groups decrease the reactivity of the benzene ring and favor substitution at the meta position, resulting in a low para-isomer yield.

2. **Relative Para-Isomer Yields**:
   - For **meta directors** (COOEt, NO₂, COOH), the para-isomer yield is low. Among these, the strength of the deactivating effect determines the para-isomer yield: NO₂ > COOH > COOEt.
   - For **ortho/para directors** (CH₃, C₂H₅, Cl), the para-isomer yield is higher. Among these, the activating groups (CH₃, C₂H₅) have higher para-isomer yields than Cl, which is deactivating but still an ortho/para director.

3. **Order of Para-Isomer Yields**:
   - **Meta Directors**: The order of para-isomer yields is **NO₂ < COOH < COOEt**.
   - **Ortho/Para Directors**: The order of para-isomer yields is **Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅**.
   - Combining these, the overall order is **NO₂ < COOH < COOEt < Cl < CH₃ < C₂H₅**.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5 → Incorrect, as COOEt (2) should have a higher para-isomer yield than NO₂ (4) and COOH (6).
   - **Option B**: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3 → Incorrect, as NO₂ (4) should come before COOH (6).
   - **Option C**: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3 → Incorrect, as Cl (3) should have a higher para-isomer yield than CH₃ (1) and C₂H₅ (5).
   - **Option D**: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4 → Incorrect, as meta directors (NO₂, COOH, COOEt) should come before ortho/para directors.

### Conclusion:
The correct order based on the analysis is **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**, but this order does not match any of the provided options. Given the constraints, **Option C** is the closest match, even though it does not fully align with the reasoning.
