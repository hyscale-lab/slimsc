Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². That means the magnitude of the field is 1/r², and it's only pointing in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I'm supposed to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the divergence of a vector field relates to how the field spreads out or converges at a point. And the integral of the divergence over a volume is given by the divergence theorem, which connects it to the flux through the surface enclosing that volume.

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface S bounding V. So, mathematically, ∫∫∫_V ∇·f dV = ∫∫_S f · dA.

In this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So, the surface is a sphere of radius R. Now, I need to find the divergence of f first.

Since f is only radial and its magnitude is 1/r², let's express it in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, a vector field with only radial component can be written as f = f_r er, where er is the unit radial vector. So, f_r = 1/r².

The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for such a field is different from Cartesian. I think the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r)

Because when a vector field has components only in the radial direction, the divergence simplifies to that expression. Let me double-check that. Oh right, yeah, because in spherical coordinates, the divergence for a vector field A = A_r er + A_θ eθ + A_φ eφ is:

∇·A = (1/r²) ∂(r² A_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(A_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂A_φ/∂φ

But since our field has only A_r ≠ 0, the other terms are zero. So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r).

So substituting A_r = f_r = 1/r², we get:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify the inside: r²*(1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇·f = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin? Because r=0 would be a problem since 1/r² isn't defined there. Oh, right, so the divergence is zero for r ≠ 0.

So the integral of the divergence over the volume of the sphere (radius R) would be zero, because everywhere inside except the origin, the divergence is zero. But wait, wait a second. Remember that this vector field is similar to the electric field of a point charge, which has a divergence proportional to the charge at the origin.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me recalculate that.

Given f_r = 1/r².

Then, using the spherical divergence formula for radial component only:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * f_r) )

So substituting f_r:

= (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²) )
= (1/r²) d/dr (1)
= (1/r²) * 0
= 0.

So except at r=0, the divergence is zero. So the integral over any volume that doesn't include r=0 would be zero. But if the sphere of radius R includes r=0 (which it does, since it's centered at the origin), then do we have a problem?

Ah, that's the point. The divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. So, integrating over the entire sphere (which includes the origin) would give us a Dirac delta function type situation if the field were like an inverse square law field with a charge at the origin. But in this problem, we're just given f(r) = 1/r², without mentioning any point charge or a delta function.

Wait, perhaps the field isn't defined at the origin. So, when considering the volume integral, if the origin is included, the divergence isn't zero—wait, but in our calculation, it is zero except at r=0. So, the integral over the volume would be zero?

But wait, I'm a bit confused because if I recall, the divergence of the electric field E due to a point charge is ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, where ρ is the charge density, which is a delta function at the origin. So, in that case, the integral of ∇·E over a volume containing the origin would be the charge divided by ε₀.

But in our problem, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r² and radial. So, perhaps f is analogous to E. Let's think about that.

If f is like the electric field of a charge, then E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) er. The divergence of E is (1/(4πε₀)) q δ³(r), so the integral over any volume containing the origin would be (q/(4πε₀)).

Wait, but in our problem, we don't have any mention of a charge, but the magnitude is given as 1/r². If f is analogous to E, then f = (1/(4π)) (q/r²) er, but in our case, the magnitude is 1/r², so perhaps f is (1/(4π)) er. So, q/(4π) = 1. So q would be 4π.

But regardless of the specific constants, the point is that the divergence of f would be a delta function at the origin. So, the volume integral of the divergence would be equal to the flux at the surface, which is 4π times the "charge" or the source at the origin.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. The problem states that the field has non-zero component only along the radial direction and falls off as 1/r². So, in terms of the electric field analogy, perhaps f(r) is proportional to E.

Wait, let me compute the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius R. The flux is the integral of f · dA over the surface. Since f is radial, the dot product is just f(r) * dA. The surface area element dA is r² sinθ dθ dφ. Since we're on a sphere of radius R, r=R.

So, flux Φ = ∫∫ f(R) R² sinθ dθ dφ. Since f(R) = 1/(R²), substituting:

Φ = ∫∫ [1/(R²)] * R² sinθ dθ dφ = ∫∫ sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral over θ from 0 to π is ∫ sinθ dθ = 2. The integral over φ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So, Φ = 2 * 2π = 4π.

So, the flux through the surface is 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux, which is 4π.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the divergence of f is zero everywhere except the origin. So, the integral over the volume would be zero, but according to the flux calculation, it's 4π. That suggests a contradiction.

Ah, I see. My mistake was in computing the divergence. Oh wait, maybe I forgot to account for the fact that f has a delta function divergence only at the origin, which would require the divergence to be zero elsewhere but integrate to a non-zero value.

Wait, but how? Let me re-examine the divergence calculation.

If f is 1/r² radial, then the divergence is ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0, for r ≠0.

So, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0 where it's undefined. But the divergence theorem says that the volume integral is equal to the flux through the surface. Since the flux is 4π, the volume integral must be 4π, even though the divergence is zero. How does that reconcile?

Ah, because the function has a singularity at the origin. The divergence isn't actually zero in the distributional sense. Instead, it's a delta function at the origin. So, the volume integral of ∇·f is 4π, because the divergence is a delta function scaled such that the integral over all space is 4π.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But when you integrate over the entire volume, including the origin, the integral captures the singularity as a finite value.

So, according to the divergence theorem, ∫∫∫_V ∇·f dV = ∫∫_{S} f · dA = 4π.

Therefore, the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π. So looking back at the options, option A is 4π. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the divergence is zero, leading to zero integral. But that's only correct if the divergence is zero everywhere inside V, including at the origin. But since the divergence isn't actually zero in the distributional sense (it's a delta function), the integral isn't zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 4π.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin, we proceed as follows:

The vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) has a magnitude \( f(r) = 1/r^2 \) and is directed radially in spherical coordinates. The divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) in spherical coordinates for a purely radial vector field is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right),
\]

where \( f_r = 1/r^2 \). Substituting \( f_r \) into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0 \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field has a singularity. However, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere:

\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
\]

To compute the flux \( \Phi \), note that \( \mathbf{f} \) is radial and its magnitude is \( f(r) = 1/r^2 \). The surface element in spherical coordinates is \( d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \cdot \hat{r} \). Since \( \mathbf{f} \) is radial, the dot product \( \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} \) simplifies to \( f(R) \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \). Substituting \( f(R) = 1/R^2 \):

\[
\Phi = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integrals evaluate to:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi, \quad \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2.
\]

Thus, the flux is:

\[
\Phi = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]

By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere is equal to the flux through the surface:

\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: A**
