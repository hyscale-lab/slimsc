Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. The question gives me the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx, and asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. 

Wait, but how does that work? I think the Uncertainty Principle is usually stated in terms of position and momentum. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But energy is related to momentum because of the kinetic energy equation. Oh right, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass.

So maybe I can connect ΔE with Δp. Let me think. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Since energy is p²/(2m), the uncertainty in energy would involve Δp. But wait, for an electron moving at a certain speed, the momentum p is mv. But here, I think we're dealing with uncertainties, so Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.

So the plan is: 

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle. 
2. Then find ΔE based on Δp.

Right, step 1: Use Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. The given Δx is 0.1 nm. Let me convert that to meters. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. 

Wait, the formula says Δx * Δp is approximately ħ/2. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). 

What's ħ? Oh, it's approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me use that value. 

So plugging in the numbers: ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s, Δx = 1e-10 m. 

Δp ≈ (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-10) = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. 

Wait, so that's the uncertainty in momentum. Now, how to get the uncertainty in energy. 

I think the kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be ( (Δp)^2 ) / (2m) ), but wait, no, that's assuming that the kinetic energy is entirely due to the momentum uncertainty. Alternatively, I think the relation is more precise when using the derivative. 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the uncertainty principle in the form that relates energy and time, but that's another uncertainty relation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since energy is the time derivative of action, but maybe that's more complicated.

Another angle: The energy of a particle is related to its momentum. So if we have an uncertainty in momentum, Δp, then the uncertainty in kinetic energy would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E = p²/(2m), so the relative uncertainty in E would be roughly (2 Δp / p)², but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, using the same approach as the Heisenberg principle: treating ΔE as the uncertainty in energy, perhaps we can say ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So, m is the mass of an electron, which is about 9.11e-31 kg. 

So plugging in Δp = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s:

ΔE ≈ (5.25e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.11e-31) 

First, compute the numerator: (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 * 1e-50. 5.25 squared is 27.5625, so 27.5625e-50 J²·s²/kg²? Wait, units might be getting messy, but I'll focus on numbers.

So numerator is 27.5625e-50. Denominator is 2 * 9.11e-31 = 18.22e-31. 

So:

ΔE ≈ (27.5625e-50) / (18.22e-31) 

Let me compute that. 27.5625 / 18.22 ≈ 1.513. And 1e-50 / 1e-31 = 1e-19. 

So ΔE ≈ 1.513e-19 J. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, which is close. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me compute 5.25e-25 squared: 5.25 squared is 27.5625, so 27.5625e-50. Divided by (2 *9.11e-31) which is 1.822e-30. 

Wait, no, 2 *9.11e-31 is 1.822e-30. So denominator is 1.822e-30. 

So 27.5625e-50 / 1.822e-30 = (27.5625 / 1.822) * 1e-20. 

27.5625 / 1.822 is approximately 15.13. So 15.13e-20, which is 1.513e-19 J. 

So yes, about 1.5e-19 J. That's option C, which is ~1e-19 J. 

Wait, but perhaps I should consider whether the approximation uses ħ/2 or ħ. The original uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. If I use Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx), that's the minimum. So when you calculate ΔE, you're taking the minimum uncertainty, so using the equality. 

So that should be correct.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position, and \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum. The given uncertainty in position is \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the equality \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, we relate the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) to the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \). For a particle with kinetic energy \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( m \approx 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 27.81 \times 10^{-50}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} = 1.821876712 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{27.81 \times 10^{-50}}{1.821876712 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.526 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This result is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to option C, \( \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
