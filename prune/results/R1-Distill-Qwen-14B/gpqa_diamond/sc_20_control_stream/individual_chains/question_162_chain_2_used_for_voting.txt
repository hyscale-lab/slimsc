Okay, so I have this question about general relativity or maybe differential geometry. The question gives a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's only in dx and dy. So it's a 2-manifold. But the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, pseudosphere as a term can sometimes refer to a specific surface, like the tractricoid, but I'm not sure how that connects here.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. So maybe I should think in terms of the metric given. Let's parse the metric first. The line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor g has components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = 0. So it's diagonal.

I'm trying to find the area. For a 2D surface, the area can be found using the determinant of the metric tensor. The area A is the integral over the surface of sqrt(det g) dx dy. But wait, the determinant for a diagonal metric is just (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero here, det g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, so sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but what is the region over which we are integrating? The metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So for the metric to be real, 4 - x² - y² must be positive. So x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the xy-plane.

So the area is the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral seems tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates to make it easier. x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integral becomes:

Integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π.

So the area A is the integral of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me separate the integrals. The θ integral is from 0 to 2π, which is 2π. The r integral is from 0 to 2.

So A = 2π * ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr. Hmm, but the integral has r dr in the numerator, so let's see:

The integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²). Let's substitute u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u = (-16) ∫ du/u.

The limits: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes from u=4 to u=0.

∫ from 4 to 0 of (-16) (1/u) du = (-16) [ln u from 4 to 0] → (-16) [ln 0 - ln4]. But ln 0 is negative infinity. Wait, but let's think about the substitution.

Wait, let me re-express the substitution correctly. Let's change variables:

When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 down to 0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ] → 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du → (-16) * [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

That would be (-16) (ln 0 - ln4). But ln 0 is -infinity, so ln0 - ln4 is -infinity - ln4, which is -infinity. So the integral becomes (-16)*(-infinity) = positive infinity? Wait, wait. Let me compute:

Wait, ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r², so du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So 32 * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * ∫ (-du/2) / u = -16 ∫ du/u from u=4 to u=0.

But integrating from 4 to 0 is the same as -( ∫ from 0 to4 ). So:

-16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) du/u = -16 * ( ∫ from 0 to4 du/u ) * (-1) )= -16 * [ ln u ] from 0 to4 ) * (-1) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute the integral step by step.

The integral ∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2:

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [from u=4 to u=0] ( (-du/2) ) / u = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) du/u.

Which is 32*(-1/2) [ ∫ from 4 to 0 du/u ].

The integral ∫ du/u is ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 4 to 0:

[ ln0 - ln4 ] = (-infinity) - ln4 = -infinity.

So the integral becomes:

32*(-1/2) * (-infinity) → 32*(1/2) * infinity → 16 * infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 32 * (-1/2) is -16, multiplied by [ -inf ], which would be positive infinity. Oh, because ∫ from 4 to0 is negative of ∫ from 0 to4. So perhaps I should have:

∫ (from 4 to 0) du/u = - ∫ (from 0 to4) du/u = - ( ln4 - ln0 ) → but ln0 is -inf, so ln4 - (-inf) = +inf. So the integral is -inf.

Wait, no, ∫ du/u from a to b is ln b - ln a. So ∫ from 4 to 0 is ln0 - ln4 = (-inf) - ln4 = -inf.

So the integral is 32*(-1/2) * (-inf) → 16 * inf → which is infinity.

So the area A is 2π multiplied by this integral, which is infinity. So A = 2π * (infinity) → which is infinity.

Wait, but wait. The area is integrating over all r from 0 to 2, but when r approaches 2, the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero, so the integrand becomes large. That suggests that the area might be infinite.

Wait, but how? Because the area of a sphere in Euclidean space is finite, but here the metric might be singular at r=2. So perhaps the area is actually infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but why is the question referring to a pseudosphere of radius r=2?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metric provided is that of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature). The area of a pseudosphere is finite. Wait, but wait, a pseudosphere is an infinitely extending surface, so its area is infinite. Or is it? Or perhaps in some models, like the tractricoid, which is a finite area surface with infinite extent? No, the tractricoid (pseudosphere) has finite area. Wait, no, wait: the tractricoid has finite area. Because the tractricoid is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and its surface area is 4π a², where a is the radius of curvature. Wait, but that's the case for a sphere. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given here isn't that of a pseudosphere. Let me think about what the metric represents.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space. Because hyperbolic space can be represented in coordinates where the metric has a denominator that's linear in the radial coordinate.

Wait, in Poincaré coordinates, the hyperbolic plane metric is ds² = [dr² + r² dθ²] / (a² (1 - r²/a²)^2 ), but maybe I'm mixing up the forms.

Wait, another approach: compute the Gaussian curvature. The area being infinite suggests that the curvature is negative and the space is hyperbolic, which would have infinite area. Alternatively, if the Gaussian curvature is positive, the area could be finite.

Wait, but to find the Gaussian curvature, I can use the formula for a 2D metric. The Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula derived from the metric components.

The formula for Gaussian curvature for a metric g = E(dx)^2 + 2F dx dy + G(dy)^2 is:

K = [ - (E G'' - G E'' - 2 F E' G' + 2 F' E G' + 2 F' G E' - F'' E G) ] / (2 E G - F² )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, for a metric in the form ds² = A(x,y) (dx^2 + dy^2), which is the case here with A = 32/(4 - x² - y²), the Gaussian curvature can be found using another method. For a metric A(dx^2 + dy^2), the Gaussian curvature is K = (Δ ln A)/2, where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D.

Wait, no, perhaps it's K = - (1/(2 A)) * (d/dx [ (A)_x / A ] + d/dy [ (A)_y / A ] ), but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the formula for K when the metric is conformally flat (which this is, since it's A(dx^2 + dy^2)) is:

K = - (1/(2 A)) [ ∂² ln A / ∂x² + ∂² ln A / ∂y² ]

Wait, another approach: For a function A(x,y), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 A)) (A_xx + A_yy)

Where A_xx is the second partial derivative of A with respect to x twice, and similarly for A_yy.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: For a conformally flat metric, the Gaussian curvature can be computed as:

K = - (1/(2 A)) ( (∂² ln A)/(∂x²) + (∂² ln A)/(∂y²) ) )

Yes, I think that's correct.

So, A(x,y) =32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32 (4 - r²)^-1, where r² =x² + y².

Compute ln A = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²). So,

ln A = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) → derivatives will be with respect to x and y.

Wait, but the second derivatives would be:

First, compute the first derivatives:

d(ln A)/dx = [0 - ( -2x )/(4 - r²) ] → 2x/(4 - r²)

Similarly, d²(ln A)/(dx²) = [2*(4 - r²) - (2x)(-2x)]/(4 - r²)^2 → [2(4 - r²) +4x² ]/(4 - r²)^2 → [8 - 2r² +4x² ]/( (4 - r²)^2 )

Wait, but since r² = x² + y², 4x² =4(r² - y²). Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute in polar coordinates.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in polar coordinates since the metric is radially symmetric.

Let me switch to polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, A(r) =32/(4 - r²).

Compute ln A = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian in 2D for a radially symmetric function is (1/r) d/dr (r d(ln A)/dr ). So:

d(ln A)/dr = d/dr [ -ln(4 - r²) ] → (2r)/(4 - r²).

Then, (1/r) [ d/dr ( r * (2r)/(4 - r²) ) ) ].

Compute inside the brackets: r * (2r)/(4-r²) = 2 r²/(4 - r²).

d/dr of that: [ (4 r (4 - r²) ) - 2r²*(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2 = [4 r (4 - r²) +4 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 16 r -4 r^3 +4 r^3 = 16 r.

So, (1/r) * [16 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] = 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian of ln A is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but the formula for Gaussian curvature K is -(1/(2 A )) times this Laplacian. So,

K = -(1/(2 A )) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

But A =32/(4 - r²), so 1/A = (4 - r²)/32.

So,

K = -(1/(2 * (32/(4 - r²))) ) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= -( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= -(16 (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= -(16)/(64 (4 - r²)) )

= -(1)/(4 (4 - r²)) )

So K = -1/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, that doesn't look like a constant curvature. So this isn't a surface of constant curvature, which is unlike a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed the Laplacian, I had:

d(ln A)/dr = 2 r/(4 - r²).

Then, (1/r) d/dr [ r * (2 r)/(4 - r^2) ) ]

Which is (1/r) d/dr [ 2 r²/(4 - r^2) ]

Let me compute that derivative more carefully.

So, let f(r) = 2 r²/(4 - r²).

df/dr = [ (4 r)(4 - r²) ) + (2 r²)(2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait,

df/dr = [ (4 r)(4 - r²) + 2 r² * 2 r ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ (16 r -4 r^3) + 4 r^3 ] / (4 - r^2)^2

= [16 r -4 r^3 +4 r^3 ] / denominator

= 16 r / denominator.

So, (1/r) df/dr = 16 r / denominator * (1/r) ) → 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Thus, K = -(1/(2 A )) * 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Substituting A=32/(4 - r²),

1/(2 A) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = -( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= -(16 (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 )

= -(16)/[64 (4 - r²) ]

= -(1/4) * 1/(4 - r^2 )

So, K = -1/(4 (4 - r^2 )).

Hmm, so K is not a constant; it depends on r. So the curvature isn't constant. That suggests that this isn't a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature) but some other surface.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the metric given with the pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps the metric is part of a pseudosphere. Or maybe the question has a typo, and the metric is in 3D.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is infinite because the metric's denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2. That would mean that at r=2, the metric becomes singular, and the area integral diverges.

So, looking back, the area I calculated was infinite because the integral ∫ [32 r ]/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2 diverges. Therefore, the area is infinite, so the answer would be option D) +infty.

Wait, but why is the question talking about a pseudosphere of radius 2? Because in hyperbolic geometry, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tractricoid, which is the pseudosphere, is a surface of infinite extent with finite area. Wait, but in Euclidean space, a sphere has finite area. So perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, no, the tractricoid is a surface of revolution with finite area but infinite length. So its area is finite. Hmm, but in this problem, the metric given might not represent a tractricoid, but perhaps a different kind of surface.

But according to the calculations, the area is divergent because the integrand approaches infinity as r approaches 2. So the area is infinite, leading to option D.

The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) using the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Structure**: The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as \( ds^2 = A(x, y) (dx^2 + dy^2) \), where \( A(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). This suggests the surface is radially symmetric.

2. **Domain of Integration**: The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that the domain of integration is the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a radius of 2 in the \( xy \)-plane.

3. **Area Element**: The area element for a 2D metric is \( dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \). For this metric, \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), so:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

4. **Switching to Polar Coordinates**: To simplify the integration, switch to polar coordinates where \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

5. **Radial Integral**: The radial part of the integral is:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:
   \[
   -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \ln u \Big|_{u=4}^{u=0}.
   \]
   As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln u \to -\infty \), leading to:
   \[
   -16 \ln u \Big|_{u=4}^{u=0} = -16 \left(-\infty - \ln 4\right) = +\infty.
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: The radial integral diverges to infinity, meaning the total area of the surface is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect. The area is not zero; the metric describes a surface with finite extent but infinite area.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \))**: Incorrect. This is not the correct expression for the area, and it does not account for the divergence at \( r = 2 \).
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \))**: Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area and does not match the metric.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct. The area integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \), leading to an infinite total area.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite. 

Answer: D
