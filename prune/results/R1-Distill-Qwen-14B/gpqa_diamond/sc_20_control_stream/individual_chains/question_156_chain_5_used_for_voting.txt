Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'm going to try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions with different starting materials—(E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene—and each is treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The options are about how many peaks each will show.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation typically occurs in alkenes, where the double bond reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, so the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Wait, so for each starting material, (E) and (Z), when treated with mCPBA, they'll form different epoxides? Or do they form epoxides with different stereochemistry?

I think the ring formation in epoxidation leads to the creation of trans stereochemistry. Let me think: when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that results in the epoxide. For a trans (E) alkene, the addition would form a trans epoxide? Or does it form a cis epoxide? Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. The epoxidation of an E-alkene would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should recall how epoxidation works. mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond. The mechanism is a concerted process where the peracid attacks the alkene and forms the epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

For an E-alkene, the substituents on either end are opposite. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds in a way that the groups on adjacent carbons in the epoxide are trans. Similarly, for a Z-alkene, the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide would have cis substituents.

Wait, but in either case, the starting alkene's configuration will determine the configuration of the epoxide. So (E)-oct-4-ene will form a trans epoxide, and (Z) will form a cis epoxide?

Wait, no, actually, I think that mCPBA causes the epoxidation with a specific stereochemistry. The peracid adds the oxygen atoms in a way that the new O atoms are on opposite faces, leading to a trans addition. So, the configuration of the starting alkene (E or Z) affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the transition state. The peracid approaches the alkene, and the two new sigma bonds form in a way that the two oxygen atoms add with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, I remember that the epoxidation of alkenes using mCPBA is a syn addition. So the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. So for an E-alkene, let's imagine the double bond is trans, so substituents on each carbon are opposite. If the oxygen adds to the same face, the epoxide would have the substituents on the same side.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it out mentally. Take (E)-oct-4-ene: the two methyl groups (assuming oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond? No, wait, octene is 8 carbons. So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, that's 8 carbons in a row. So the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each starting material. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on either end of the double bond (C4 and C5) are each connected to two CH2 groups on one side and three CH2 groups on the other? Or perhaps it's better to think of each end as CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe the exact structure isn't the key here. The key is that both (E) and (Z) are being epoxidized, and each will form an epoxide with specific stereochemistry.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms will add to the same face (syn addition) due to the mCPBA mechanism. So the two oxygen atoms attach to the same face, leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, if the starting alkene is trans, and the oxygen adds to the same face, that would lead to the epoxide having the same substituents on the same face?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The addition of mCPBA to an alkene is a syn addition, meaning that the two oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond. So, for a trans-alkene (E), the substituents on either end are opposite. So, if the oxygen adds to the same face, the resulting epoxide will have the substituents on the same side of the epoxide ring.

Wait, let's imagine two substituents on each end of the double bond. For an E-alkene, the substituents are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face, so the substituents on each carbon would be on the same side. So the epoxide would have a trans configuration because the substituents were originally opposite, but now the oxygens are on the same face, leading to a trans arrangement.

Wait, maybe it's easier with a specific example. Let's say we have (E)-2-pentene. The structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. For (E), the substituents (CH2CH3 and CH2CH2) are on opposite sides.

When mCPBA adds, it does so in a syn fashion. So, the oxygen comes from the same face. So the two oxygens would be on the same face. Now, in the epoxide, the two substituents (the groups on each end) are on the same side because the oxygen addition was on the same face of the double bond, which was E (opposite) originally.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the epoxide's diastereomerism. So, the starting (E) and (Z) alkenes will give different epoxides because the configuration of substituents around the epoxide ring will be different. So, (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans epoxide, and (Z) forms a cis epoxide.

Wait, but maybe the opposite is true. For example, when mCPBA adds to a trans-alkene, the epoxide ends up being cis. Wait, no, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that epoxidation using mCPBA leads to the formation of the epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or maybe not. Let me think: the reaction is stereospecific, so the configuration of the alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, I think that the configuration of the starting alkene and the addition of mCPBA (which is a peracid) leads to a specific configuration in the epoxide. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide formed would have the substituents on the same side (cis), and for a cis (Z) alkene, the substituents on the same side would also result in a cis epoxide? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration is determined by the addition. Since mCPBA adds in a syn addition, the two oxygen atoms add to the same face. So, for a trans starting alkene, the substituents on either end would be on opposite sides. After adding two oxygen atoms to the same face, the substituents on the same side of the epoxide would be on the same face but from opposite ends. Hmm, maybe that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on whether the starting alkene was E or Z. For example, (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the two substituents on either end of the epoxide are trans, while (Z) would form a cis epoxide.

Wait, maybe another approach: think about the number of stereoisomers formed in each reaction.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Since the starting material is a single stereoisomer (E), and mCPBA does a stereospecific epoxidation, the product would be a mixture of epoxide diastereomers? Or is it a single epoxide?

Wait, wait. The starting (E) alkene has a single structure, and when it reacts with mCPBA, it forms a specific epoxide. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have a particular configuration, say, trans. But wait, does the epoxidation lead to a single diastereomer or a mixture?

Wait, mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes via a concerted mechanism, leading to the formation of an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning that the stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on the same side, leading to a cis configuration. So each reaction produces a single epoxide isomer.

Wait, but wait. Wait, mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms in a syn addition, meaning that both oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the alkene. So, if the starting alkene is E, the substituents on either end are trans. So when the oxygen adds to the same face, what does that do?

Let me imagine an E-alkene. The two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides. So, when the peracid adds, the two oxygen atoms add to the same face. So, for each carbon, the two substituents (the adjacent groups and the oxygen) are arranged in a certain way.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about specific examples. Take 2-pentene. (E)-2-pentene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, with the double bond between C2 and C3. The substituents on each end are CH2CH2 and CH2CH3, which are on opposite sides.

When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms add to the same face. So, on the same face, say the top face, the oxygen adds. So, on C2, the substituents are CH3 and O, and on C3, the substituents are CH2CH3 and O. Since the starting alkene was E, the substituents (CH3 and CH2CH3) were on opposite sides. Now, after adding oxygen to the same face, the substituents on each carbon (CH3 and O on C2; CH2CH3 and O on C3) are on the same side. So, the two substituents (CH3 and CH2CH3) on the same face of the epoxide. So in the epoxide, the two substituents are cis to each other.

Wait, that would imply that (E)-2-pentene gives a cis epoxide. Similarly, (Z)-2-pentene would give a trans epoxide? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the epoxide structure. The epoxide is a three-membered ring, with two oxygen atoms. The substituents on each carbon in the epoxide ring will determine the stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the epoxidation of an E-alkene leads to a trans epoxide, and the Z leads to a cis epoxide. Or the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that mCPBA adds to the same face (syn addition), so the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Let me think: for a trans (E) alkene, the two substituents (like R and R') are on opposite sides. Adding O from the same face would result in R and R' being on the same side of the epoxide, making the epoxide cis.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the starting alkene is E (trans), the substituents are opposite, but after adding O to the same face, those substituents are on the same side, making the epoxide cis.

Similarly, for a Z (cis) alkene, the substituents are on the same side. Adding O to the same face would cause the substituents to be on opposite sides of the epoxide ring, making the epoxide trans.

Wait, that would mean that Reaction 1, treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, gives a cis epoxide. Reaction 2, treating (Z)-oct-4-ene, gives a trans epoxide.

Wait, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion. So each starting material gives a single epoxide product.

So, in Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide.

Now, each of these epoxides is then treated with aqueous acid. What happens when epoxides are treated with acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. The ring opens via a carbocation mechanism. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with the attack of a nucleophile (like water).

In the case of acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because that's where the carbocation is more stable. So, in an epoxide, the more substituted carbon would be the one with more adjacent R groups, leading to more stable carbocation upon ring opening.

Wait, but in oct-4-ene, which is symmetric? Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, right? Because the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, each side of the epoxide is similar.

Wait, when oct-4-ene forms an epoxide, the epoxide would be between C4 and C5. So, when acid is added, the ring opens. Since the structure is symmetric, the ring opening would proceed in a way that both carbons in the epoxide are equally likely to be attacked, but in this case, perhaps both positions are equivalent, leading to a single product.

Wait, but let's think about the epoxide structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be cis, meaning that the two oxygen atoms are on the same side. The structure would have the R groups on the same side.

When acid is added, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making the adjacent carbons electrophilic. The water attacks the more substituted carbon. But in this case, both carbons in the epoxide are the same, as the molecule is symmetric. So, both carbons are equally substituted.

Wait, in the case of oct-4-ene, each epoxide carbon has two CH2 groups on either side. So, each is equally substituted. That means that the nucleophilic attack can occur on either carbon, leading to the same product because of the symmetry.

So, when the epoxide is treated with acid, it will form a diol. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol will form in a single way, leading to a single product.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the diol. The ring opening of an epoxide in acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a trans diol because the nucleophile attacks the carbons from opposite sides due to the planar carbocation (or the transition state).

Wait, no. The ring opening of epoxides under acidic conditions generally leads to the formation of a trans diol. Because the attack occurs from the opposite side of the leaving group (due to the planar transition state in the SN2-like mechanism).

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, like in this case, the diol formed would be the same regardless of which carbon is attacked first.

Wait, let me think about the product. For a symmetric epoxide, like cis-oct-4-ene oxide, when treated with acid, it would form a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides (trans) because the attack is from opposite sides. But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single compound, regardless of where the attack occurs.

Alternatively, if the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening would result in a single diastereomer.

Wait, but in reality, for a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a diol that is a single compound. Because the attack can occur on either carbon, but due to symmetry, the product is the same.

Wait, but let's get back to the original problem. Reaction 1 produces a cis epoxide (from E starting material), which upon acid treatment gives a diol. Similarly, Reaction 2 produces a trans epoxide (from Z starting material), which upon acid treatment gives another diol.

Wait, no, earlier I thought that (E) gives a cis epoxide and (Z) gives a trans. So, let's correct that.

Wait, mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, so for the E-alkene, which has substituents on opposite sides, the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to substituents on the same side in the epoxide. So, the epoxide is cis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the key here is to figure out what each reaction produces, then see what the products are, and then how they would appear on the HPLC columns.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → acid → diol.

Wait, no. If mCPBA adds syn, for (E) alkene (trans), the substituents on the same face would lead to a cis epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the (E) → cis epoxide, (Z) → trans epoxide.

Then, when each is treated with acid, the epoxide ring opens to form a diol.

But what kind of diol?

In the case of a cis epoxide, upon acid treatment, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans)?

Wait, when the epoxide is cis, the two oxygen atoms are on the same face. Upon ring-opening, each oxygen attacks from the opposite face, leading to the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces, making the diol trans.

Wait, let me think: the epoxide is a three-membered ring. For a cis epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on the same face. When the epoxide is protonated, the ring opens. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. But in this case, the molecule is symmetric, so the attack can be on either carbon.

In a symmetric cis epoxide, the ring opening under acidic conditions would form a trans diol. Because each water molecule attacks from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen. So, the two hydroxyl groups end up on opposite sides.

Similarly, for a trans epoxide (from the Z starting material), which would have the oxygen atoms on opposite faces. When the ring opens, the attacking water comes from the same side as the protonated oxygen, leading to the hydroxyl groups on the same face? Or opposite?

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for an epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the attack occurs with inversion of configuration. So, each oxygen leads to the attack from the opposite side.

Therefore, for a cis epoxide (oxygen atoms on same face), the ring opening would lead to both hydroxyls on the opposite face, making a trans diol.

For a trans epoxide (oxygen atoms on opposite faces), the ring opening would lead to the hydroxyl groups on the same face, making a cis diol.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, Reaction 1: (E) → cis epoxide → upon acid → trans diol.

Reaction 2: (Z) → trans epoxide → upon acid → cis diol.

Wait, but in our case, the starting material is (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, leading to epoxides that are cis and trans, respectively. Then, when treated with acid, each gives a diol.

But then, when the products are combined, what happens?

Wait, for Reaction 1, the product is a trans diol. For Reaction 2, the product is a cis diol. So, combining them gives a mixture of cis and trans diols.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of the diols. The diol is a vicinal diol, meaning the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons.

In Reaction 1, (E) → cis epoxide → trans diol.

In Reaction 2, (Z) → trans epoxide → cis diol.

So, after combining, the products are a trans diol and a cis diol.

But wait, for each reaction, the starting material is either E or Z, leading to specific epoxides, which in turn lead to specific diols.

But wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. So, the diols formed would be the same regardless of which carbon is attacked. So, the diols formed would each be a single compound.

Wait, but if the starting epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed would be a single compound. So, the products of each reaction are single diols. One is a cis diol, the other is a trans diol.

So, combining Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 products gives a mixture of cis and trans diols.

Now, the next step is to run this mixture on a standard HPLC column (which is achiral) and a chiral HPLC column.

In an achiral column, compounds that are diastereomers will have different retention times, while enantiomers will have the same retention time. But in this case, the cis and trans diols are diastereomers, so they would elute as separate peaks. So, on the standard HPLC, we would see two peaks.

Wait, but the cis diol and trans diol are diastereomers, so yes, they would separate. So, two peaks on standard HPLC.

On a chiral HPLC column, which can distinguish enantiomers, each enantiomer would elute as a separate peak. But wait, are the cis and trans diols chiral?

Wait, let's think about the diols. The diol from Reaction 1 is a trans diol. The diol from Reaction 2 is a cis diol.

Wait, but is the molecule chiral? Let me think: for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have no internal planes of symmetry.

In the case of the diol from Reaction 1: trans diol. The structure would be HO-CH2-CH2-OH, but with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides. Wait, but wait, the actual structure isn't that simple. The diol would be on C4 and C5 of octene. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2CH2CH3. But wait, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but for oct-4-ene, the epoxide is between C4 and C5. So, the diol would have OH groups on C4 and C5.

So, if the diol is trans, the OH groups are on opposite sides. If it's cis, on the same side.

But considering the entire molecule, is it symmetric? Let's see: the molecule is octane with OH groups on C4 and C5, and the configuration (cis or trans) would affect symmetry.

Wait, if the diol is trans, is the molecule symmetric? Let me imagine the structure.

For the trans diol: the two OH groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C4 and C5. Because each side is a mirror image.

Wait, so the trans diol would be a meso compound. Because it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, for example, consider 2,3-butanediol. The trans isomer is a meso compound, so it's achiral. Similarly, in the case of the oct-4-ene diol, the trans diol would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, the trans diol is not chiral.

On the other hand, the cis diol would lack a plane of symmetry. Let's think: if the two OH groups are on the same side, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. So, the cis diol would be chiral, with two enantiomers.

Wait, but wait—how many stereoisomers does the cis diol have? Because the diol has two stereogenic centers (C4 and C5), each with an OH group. So, in the case where both are in the same configuration, that would lead to either R,R or S,S, which are enantiomers, or R,S which would be an internal plane of symmetry (meso).

Wait, but if the diol is cis, the two OH groups are on the same face. So, C4 and C5 each have their OH groups on the same side. So, for the diol, the configuration would be R,R or S,S, which are enantiomers. Wait, but would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of specific configurations. If the diol is cis, then the two OH groups are on the same face. So, for C4 and C5, the substituents would be arranged as follows:

Assuming the diol is formed from the epoxide opening in a way that the OHs are on the same face.

So, for each carbon, the substituents are: CH2CH2CH2 (on one side), another CH2 group (on the other), and the OH group.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 2 (cis) would have two stereogenic centers, each with the same configuration (R,R or S,S), making the compound chiral, with two enantiomers. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single enatiomer because the reaction leads to a specific configuration.

Wait, but the reaction is 100% complete, so perhaps each reaction leads to a single diastereomer.

Wait, but in the case of the cis epoxide, which is symmetric, the ring-opening would lead to a single product. So, the diol would be either R,R or S,S, but each would be a pair of enantiomers. But wait, in reality, under acidic conditions, the ring opening leads to a mixture of R and S configurations.

Wait, no, because the attack is not stereoselective in that way. Wait, no, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the attack can occur from either side, leading to a racemic mixture?

Wait, no, because the epoxide is symmetric, so the attack on either carbon would give the same product. So, the diol would have both OH groups on the same face, leading to a molecule without a plane of symmetry. So, the diol would be chiral, with two enantiomers.

But wait, in our case, each reaction produces a single diol, either trans or cis. The trans diol is a meso compound (achiral), and the cis diol is a pair of enantiomers (so it's a chiral compound).

Wait, but if the cis diol is a pair of enantiomers, then when you have a mixture of the two enantiomers, they are present as a racemic mixture, which would appear as a single peak on an achiral HPLC column because the column cannot distinguish enantiomers. But on a chiral HPLC column, each enantiomer would elute as a separate peak, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but let's think again. Reaction 1 gives a trans diol, which is meso (so achiral). Reaction 2 gives a cis diol, which is a pair of enantiomers (so chiral). But each reaction gives a single product. So Reaction 2 would produce a single enantiomer? Or a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. When the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens with a specific stereochemistry, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the attack can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, in our case, the epoxide is trans (from Z starting material), which is asymmetric, or is it symmetric?

Wait, no, the epoxide from Reaction 2 is trans. Wait, if the starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the substituents on opposite faces, making it a trans epoxide. But considering the symmetry, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So, the trans epoxide would have the same substituents on both ends, but opposite in configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's best to think that each reaction produces a single diol, with specific stereochemistry, and whether that diol is chiral or not.

So, Reaction 1: E → cis epoxide. Acid treatment → trans diol, which is meso (achiral). So, this product is a single compound, with no chirality.

Reaction 2: Z → trans epoxide. Acid treatment → cis diol, which is a chiral molecule with two enantiomers. But since the reaction is 100% complete, it would produce a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers. Or wait, no, because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to completion, but under acidic conditions, the attack can come from either side because the epoxide is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I should think that Reaction 2 produces a single enantiomer, but that's not possible under symmetric conditions. Alternatively, it would produce a racemic mixture.

But wait, in a symmetric epoxide, such as a trans configuration in oct-4-ene, the attack can occur on either carbon, leading to a racemic mixture. So, Reaction 2 would produce a racemic mixture of the diol, which is a 50:50 mixture of R,R and S,S enantiomers.

Wait, but if the starting material is symmetric, then the attack on either carbon gives the same result, so the diol would be a racemic mixture.

Wait, but that would mean that the product from Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of enantiomers, each being a diastereomer with the product from Reaction 1.

But wait, the product from Reaction 1 is a trans diol, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. The product from Reaction 2 is a cis diol, which is chiral and forms a racemic mixture.

So, when the products are combined, we have:

- A meso trans diol (achiral, one compound).

- A racemic mixture of the cis diol (two enantiomers, each present as 50%).

Now, when we run this mixture on an achiral HPLC column, what happens?

The meso diol and the two enantiomers of the cis diol.

On an achiral column, enantiomers would co-elute, so the cis diol would appear as a single peak. The meso diol is a single peak. So, total peaks: 2.

On a chiral column, which can distinguish enantiomers, the cis diol would split into two peaks (each enantiomer), and the meso diol is a single peak. So, total peaks: 3.

Wait, but the meso diol is a single compound and would elute as one peak on both columns. The cis diol, being a racemic mix, would elute as a single peak on achiral (since enantiomers can't be distinguished) and as two peaks on chiral (since each enantiomer is separated).

So, in the combined product mixture, we have:

- 1 peak from the meso diol (trans).

- 1 peak from the racemic cis diol on achiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. The product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. So, when run on achiral HPLC, it would be a single peak. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

So, the total number of peaks would be:

Achiral HPLC: 2 peaks (meso and cis diol as a single peak).

Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (meso as one, and each enantiomer of cis as another).

Wait, but wait. No, the meso diol is a single compound, so one peak. The racemic cis diol on chiral HPLC would split into two peaks, so the total is 3.

But wait, the meso diol is a single peak on both columns. The cis diol is a racemic mix, so on achiral HPLC, it's one peak, on chiral, two peaks.

So, the combined product mixture has:

- From Reaction 1: 1 meso diol.

- From Reaction 2: 1 racemic mixture of cis diol.

So, on standard HPLC (achiral), you have two peaks: one for the meso and one for the cis diol (which is a racemic mix, but appears as a single peak).

On chiral HPLC, you have three peaks: the meso diol (1 peak) and each enantiomer of the cis diol (2 peaks).

Wait, but that would mean that the standard HPLC shows 2 peaks and the chiral shows 3. Looking at the options, option B is 2 in standard and 3 in chiral. So, option B.

Wait, but let's check the options:

Option B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

Yes, that's what I've reasoned.

So, the answer should be option B.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, each treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, and the resulting products analyzed on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA and aqueous acid**  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. mCPBA adds oxygen in a syn fashion, forming a **cis epoxide**.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the cis epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **trans diol**.  
   - The trans diol is a **meso compound** (achiral) due to its plane of symmetry.  

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA and aqueous acid**  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. mCPBA adds oxygen in a syn fashion, forming a **trans epoxide**.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the trans epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **cis diol**.  
   - The cis diol is **chiral** and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S).  

3. **Combining the products**  
   - The combined product mixture contains:  
     - A single meso trans diol (achiral).  
     - A racemic mixture of the cis diol (two enantiomers).  

4. **HPLC Analysis**  
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**  
     - The meso trans diol appears as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture of the cis diol appears as a single peak because enantiomers cannot be distinguished on an achiral column.  
     - Total peaks: **2**.  

   - **Chiral HPLC:**  
     - The meso trans diol appears as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture of the cis diol splits into two peaks, one for each enantiomer.  
     - Total peaks: **3**.  

5. **Conclusion**  
   - On the standard HPLC, 2 peaks are observed.  
   - On the chiral HPLC, 3 peaks are observed.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.

Answer: B
