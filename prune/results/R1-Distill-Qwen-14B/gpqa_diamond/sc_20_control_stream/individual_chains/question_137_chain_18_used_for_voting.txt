Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, right? And synchrocyclotrons are a type of that. I think they use a magnetic field and an electric field that changes over time to accelerate the particles.

The question says a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0. So its initial speed is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? That's interesting. I'm not exactly sure what that implies about the process, but maybe each acceleration step brings it to a certain energy point.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. So U0 is 190,000 volts.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. So I need to find the number of times it goes around the accelerator before reaching the desired kinetic energy.

Let me think about the basics of cyclotrons. In a cyclotron, particles move in a magnetic field, and the electric field accelerates them as they pass through the gaps between the D-shaped boxes. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency for effective acceleration.

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron, which I think is a type that has a variable magnetic field. Because in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, so you can't accelerate particles beyond a certain energy. Synchrocyclotrons change the magnetic field over time to allow for higher energies. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the number of revolutions.

The kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. Wait, that's a huge amount of energy. Protons, when accelerated, their kinetic energy depends on the voltage they pass through. Oh, but wait, the voltage here is U(t), which is varying with time.

I think each time the proton goes around, it gets accelerated once. Because each revolution, the electric field does work on the proton. But wait, the voltage is time-dependent, so the acceleration might not be the same each time. Or perhaps each time it's in the accelerating gap, it gets a kick.

Let me think about the energy gained per revolution. In a regular cyclotron, the maximum energy is achieved when you have a certain number of revolutions. But since the question has two accelerations, I'm a bit confused. Maybe each acceleration happens over a certain number of revolutions?

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, maybe it's accelerated twice, so two steps. Or perhaps it's accelerated each half-revolution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(2πν α t + Φ0). Hmm. The function has angular frequency 2πν α. So the frequency is ν multiplied by some factor alpha. But I'm not sure what α represents here. Maybe it's the number of revolutions or something else.

Wait, but in cyclotrons, the cyclotron frequency is ω = (qB)/(m). So the proton's angular frequency depends on the magnetic field strength. But in a synchrocyclotron, B increases with time, so the frequency changes, which means that the applied voltage must be adjusted to match the changing frequency. That's why the phase constant Φ0 is important.

So the key here is probably to find out how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching 950 MeV. So I need to calculate the number of revolutions N.

I remember that the kinetic energy gained by a particle when accelerated through a potential difference V is ΔKE = qV, assuming non-relativistic speeds. But wait, 950 MeV is way beyond non-relativistic energies. For a proton, rest mass is around 938 MeV, so 950 MeV is highly relativistic.

Hmm, but in a cyclotron, the energy per revolution is approximately q times the accelerating voltage. Wait, but the voltage here is time-dependent, so each time the proton is accelerated, it's under a different voltage.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage is adjusted as the magnetic field increases. So the phase of the voltage must stay in sync with the particle's motion. So the phase Φ0 is π/4, which is 45 degrees. That probably affects the initial timing of the acceleration.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the main formula. The number of revolutions N can be found by considering the energy gained per revolution and the total energy. But in this case, each revolution may not give the same energy because the voltage is changing.

Wait, perhaps the energy gained per revolution depends on the time at which it's accelerated. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe each revolution contributes a fixed amount of energy, but I don't think that's the case here because the voltage is varying sinusoidally.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps it's accelerated twice as it goes around. So maybe each revolution includes two acceleration steps? Or that each revolution includes two voltage peaks, so each peak gives a certain energy gain.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so T ≈ 0. The final kinetic energy is 950 MeV. So the proton gains 950 MeV through acceleration.

Each time it's accelerated, it gains some energy. Let's say each time it goes through the gap, it gains an energy of q*U0, but that depends on the voltage and the charge.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...). The maximum voltage is U0. So when the proton passes through the gap, the potential difference across the gap is maximum when cos(...) = 1, so U=U0. So the maximum energy gain per acceleration step (per half-revolution, perhaps) is q * U0.

But wait, the charge of a proton is +e, so each time it goes through the gap, it gains e * U0. Wait, but U is the voltage. So the energy is e * U(t) for each step, but since the voltage is a function of time, each acceleration step might give a different energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the average energy gained per revolution is considered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute the energy per acceleration. If each time the proton is accelerated, it gains e * U0. Since U0 is 190 kV, then e * U0 is 190,000 eV = 190 keV. So each acceleration step gives 190 keV.

But the total energy needed is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. So how many steps of 190 keV each are needed? That would be (950,000) / (190) ≈ 5000 steps. Hmm, but the options don't have 5000 as an option. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, but wait, the question says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps. So each full revolution, the proton is accelerated twice.

But wait, in a cyclotron, the particles go around and each time they pass through the gap, they get a push. So if the voltage is applied such that each half-revolution (each gap traversal) gives a push. So perhaps each full revolution includes two acceleration steps.

Wait, the question says "two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Hmm, does that mean that the proton is accelerated twice, each time adding some energy, or that each revolution includes two accelerations?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe the number of acceleration steps is equal to the number of times the voltage peaks. Each peak (each maximum of the voltage) would give an energy of e*U0.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...). So each time the argument of cosine increases by π, the cosine goes from 1 to -1, implying a period of T = 1/ν. Wait, but ν is multiplied by α in the argument. So the angular frequency is 2πν α. So the time period is T = 1/(ν α).

Wait, but how does this relate to the particle's motion? The particle's angular frequency is ω = qB/(m). But in a synchrocyclotron, B increases with time, so ω is not constant. Therefore, the cyclotron frequency is changing, which means the applied voltage's frequency must change to match the particle's frequency. That's why the phase Φ0 is needed.

This seems complicated. Let me try to find a formula or approach that relates the number of revolutions to the energy.

In a regular cyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by N = (gamma - 1)/(2), where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But that's for a fixed B field, and the maximum energy is achieved when the particle reaches the edge of the D-shaped boxes. But synchrocyclotrons are different because B increases.

Alternatively, for a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions can be found using the formula:

N = (ΔE) / (e U0) * (1/(1 + (gamma^2)))

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each revolution provides an energy gain of e U0, but since the proton is moving relativistically, the actual energy gain per revolution decreases as gamma increases.

Wait, maybe we can use the formula for the total energy gained as the sum of each acceleration step. Each step gives e U0, but since the magnetic field is increasing, the time for each revolution increases. Hmm.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think of the problem differently. The problem gives a voltage as a function of time, and the phase is given. So perhaps the number of revolutions can be found by determining how many times the particle goes around before it reaches the desired energy.

The kinetic energy T is related to the momentum p via T = (p^2)/(2m) - m c^2, but that's for relativistic particles. But since the energy is 950 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (which is about 938 MeV), the proton is ultra-relativistic.

Wait, but perhaps we can approximate T ≈ pc, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, considering the energy is 950 MeV, which is approximately 1 GeV. The rest mass is about 0.938 GeV. So the total energy E = T + m c^2 = 950 MeV + 938 MeV = 1888 MeV. So gamma is E/(m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.01.

Wait, gamma is about 2. So the kinetic energy is roughly (gamma -1) m c^2, which fits.

But how does that relate to the number of revolutions?

In a cyclotron, each revolution the particle makes a semicircle, and during each passage through the gap, it is accelerated by the voltage. In a regular cyclotron, the number of revolutions N is equal to the number of times the particle is accelerated, which is (gamma -1)/(q B e / (m c)) ... Hmm, I'm not confident about this.

Wait, another approach: the synchrocyclotron's frequency is adjusted to match the changing angular frequency of the proton as it gains energy. The resonance condition is that the applied voltage's frequency matches the proton's angular frequency.

The angular frequency of the proton is ω(t) = sqrt( (q B(t))/(m) ) ), but if the magnetic field is varying, that complicates things. So the applied voltage's frequency ν is adjusted so that:

2 π ν = ω(t) = (q B(t))/(m)

So the frequency of the voltage must match the proton's angular frequency at each instant.

But how does that help me find the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions N is given by the total phase difference divided by 2π, but that's unclear.

Wait, let's model the energy gain. Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains energy e U0, but since the magnetic field is changing, the time between each acceleration increases.

But wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I can model the time taken for each revolution and sum them up until the energy is reached.

The energy gained per revolution could be considered as e U0, but that might not account for relativistic effects.

Wait, the problem says two accelerations. Oh, perhaps it's saying that the proton is accelerated twice to reach T1=950 MeV. So each acceleration step gives a certain energy, and two steps reach the target.

Wait, if each acceleration step gives e U0, then two steps would give 2e U0. Let's compute that: 2 * 190,000 eV = 380,000 eV = 0.38 MeV. That's way less than 950 MeV. So that can't be right.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps each revolution corresponds to multiple acceleration steps. Maybe each revolution has two acceleration steps, so each revolution gives 2 * e U0 of energy.

Wait, no, that would still be 2 * 190kV per revolution. So N revolutions would give N * 380 kV. So to reach 950,000 kV, N would be 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500. Which is option D.

But wait, the options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

So that would make D the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: the number of revolutions is N = (gamma -1) * m c^2 / (e U0) )

Wait, gamma is about 2, so (gamma -1) is 1. So N ≈ (1 * 938 MeV)/(190 kV) ) = 938,000 / 190 ≈ 4936.84. Hmm, that's 4936, not an option. But the options are C)3536 and B)5300.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

In a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by:

N = (E_kinetic) / (e U0) ) * (1 + ... )

Wait, but perhaps the formula is N = (E_kinetic) / (e U0) ) * (1/(something)).

Wait, another approach: The energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron can be approximated as E_rev = e U0 / (gamma). Because as the particle gains energy, its gamma increases, and the time between revolutions increases, so the energy per revolution decreases.

Wait, that would mean that each revolution gives e U0 / gamma.

But if the energy is increasing, gamma is changing, so it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe for each revolution, the energy gain is e U0 divided by the current gamma.

But integrating over gamma from 1 to gamma_final would be needed. Hmm, this seems complicated for a problem that is likely intended to be solved with a simpler approach.

Wait, let's instead consider the total number of times the voltage completes a cycle. The proton's motion must stay in sync with the voltage's phase.

The phase of the voltage is given by 2π ν alpha t + Phi_0.

Phi_0 is pi/4. So the initial phase is 45 degrees.

At each revolution, the proton would have gone through an angle of 2 pi radians. But the voltage's phase must match the proton's position in the gap.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the problem this way: the number of revolutions N is the number of times the proton circles the synchrocyclotron before reaching the desired energy.

Each time the proton goes through the acceleration gap, it gains energy e U0. But because the magnetic field is increasing, the time for each revolution is longer.

But perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that each time the proton enters the gap, the voltage is at its peak, so the proton gains maximum energy each time.

In that case, the number of acceleration steps would be the total energy divided by e U0.

So the total number of steps N_steps = T1 / (e U0) ) = 950,000,000 eV / (190,000 eV) ) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190000 = 5. So 5 steps? But that's not possible because the options are in thousands.

Wait, wait, no. 950,000,000 eV? No, 950 MeV is 950,000,000 eV. Hmm, but 950e6 eV divided by 190e3 eV is 950e6 /190e3 = (950/190) * (1e3/1e3 ) ) = 5 * 1 =5 steps. So N_steps=5.

But each revolution provides two steps? Because in a cyclotron, each full revolution includes two passages through the accelerating gaps. So each revolution gives two steps. So the number of revolutions is N = N_steps / 2 =5 /2=2.5, which doesn't make sense. So this approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe each full revolution corresponds to one acceleration step. So N_steps= N_revolutions.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let's try another angle. The time taken for each revolution is T_rev = (2 pi m )/(q B(t)) ). But B(t) is varying, so T_rev is increasing.

But the time between each acceleration step is the time between each application of the voltage. If the applied voltage has a frequency ν, then the time between peaks is 1/(2 ν), because the cosine function peaks every π/(ν alpha) time? Wait, the argument is 2 pi nu alpha t + Phi0. So the frequency of the voltage is 2 pi nu alpha. So the period is T_voltage = 1/(nu alpha).

But the particle's revolution period is T_p = 2 pi m/(q B(t)).

In a synchrocyclotron, the voltage's frequency is adjusted to match the particle's angular frequency. So:

2 pi nu alpha = q B(t) / m.

But B(t) increases with time, so the voltage's frequency increases as well.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Wait, maybe the number of times the voltage completes a cycle is equal to the number of revolutions. Because each revolution, the proton goes through one gap. Or perhaps two gaps per revolution.

In a regular cyclotron, each revolution includes two passes through the gap (because it's a D-shaped box, so each 180 degrees brings it back, so maybe two gaps per full revolution). So perhaps each revolution gives two acceleration steps.

Thus, the total number of acceleration steps would be 2*N, where N is the number of revolutions.

So if each step gives e U0, then:

Total energy = (2 N) * e U0.

So,

N = Total Energy / (2 e U0 )

Plugging in the numbers:

Total energy T1 = 950 MeV = 950,000,000 eV.

e U0 = 190,000 eV.

So,

N = (950e6 eV) / (2 * 190e3 eV) ) = (950e6) / (380e3) ) = 950e6 / 3.8e5 = 9500 /3.8 ≈ 2500.

So N = 2500 revolutions.

Which is option D.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy required. The proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and undergoes acceleration to reach a kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The alternating voltage applied is \(U(t) = U_0 \cos\left[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0\right]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy as it passes through the accelerating gaps. Each full revolution includes two acceleration steps because the proton traverses the gap twice per revolution. The energy gained per acceleration step is approximately \(e U_0\), where \(e\) is the charge of the proton. Thus, the total energy gained after \(N\) revolutions is given by:

\[
T_1 = 2 N e U_0
\]

Rearranging for \(N\), the number of revolutions:

\[
N = \frac{T_1}{2 e U_0}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}\),
- \(e U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{eV}\),

\[
N = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{2 \times 190 \times 10^3} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{380 \times 10^3} = \frac{950}{380} \approx 2500
\]

Thus, the proton makes approximately 2500 revolutions in the synchrocyclotron.
