Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Okay, let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. They dehydrated it to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products: a major and a minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. Then, the NOESY NMR spectra show a cross-peak in the major product but not so much in the minor.

The question is about which two resonances in the major product's 1H NMR are connected by this cross-peak.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, let's think about the initial steps.

The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When you dehydrate a dicarboxylic acid, you typically form an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride probably depends on the structure of the acid. Since the acid has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, perhaps a bridged structure.

Wait, the NMR data for the anhydride is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. High chemical shift like 7 ppm usually suggests protons near an electron-withdrawing group, maybe aromatic or conjugated double bonds. Oh wait, but in this case, it's an anhydride. So maybe it's an aromatic anhydride? Or maybe it's an alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid that forms a cyclic anhydride with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak. That suggests all equivalent protons. For example, maybe the anhydride is a bridged bicyclic structure with symmetry, like a bicyclo system where all the protons are equivalent. Or perhaps it's a five-membered ring.

Looking at the 13C NMR data: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is in the range for a carbonyl group, but wait, 165 ppm is definitely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester or an anhydride. Oh, wait, the anhydride would have two carbonyl groups. But in the 13C NMR, there are two peaks, so perhaps two different carbonyl carbons. Or maybe the two carbonyls are in equivalent positions? Or maybe one is an anhydride oxygen and the other is something else.

Wait, the initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid, so when dehydrated, it forms the anhydride. So the anhydride would have two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the 13C NMR shows two carbonyls. 137 ppm might be a carbonyl from the anhydride, and 165 ppm another carbonyl. Alternatively, 137 could be a double bond carbonyl, but that's probably not right.

Wait, but wait. The 13C NMR has two peaks. So maybe the anhydride has two equivalent carbonyl carbons. Or perhaps one is an anhydride bridge, and the other is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure with equivalent carbonyls.

Wait, another thought: if the dicarboxylic acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid (e.g., fumaric acid), which upon dehydration would form a maleic anhydride. But maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, maleic anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are adjacent, connected by an oxygen bridge. The structure is cyclic with two carbonyl groups.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show certain protons. Let me think: the two protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in maleic anhydride are deshielded, giving a peak around 6.5-7.5 ppm. Wait, but the anhydride in question has a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR. So perhaps it's a more symmetric structure.

Wait, another possibility: The anhydride could be a bicyclic compound, like a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the original acid is a di-substituted cis-alkene, like a cyclohexene-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. Let me think about the structure. For example, if the acid is cis-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, dehydration would form an anhydride with a bridged structure. But would that lead to a single proton peak?

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a succinic anhydride derivative, but that's a linear structure, which wouldn't have a single peak.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has two peaks, one at 137 ppm and one at 165 ppm. 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl or an spÂ² carbon. Wait, 137 is in the range for a double bond carbon. 165 is definitely a carbonyl. So perhaps the anhydride has a conjugated system, maybe like a maleate structure.

Wait, but maleic anhydride has two double bonds. Let's think about its NMR. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the two CH groups) are each split into a doublet, and in the case of maleic anhydride, they appear as two separate peaks around 6.5-7 ppm. But in the given problem, the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. So that suggests all the protons are equivalent, which would imply a higher symmetry.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a cyclic structure where all the protons are equivalent. For instance, if the anhydride is a bridged bicyclic compound where the protons are all equivalent, such as a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, but I'm not certain.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next part.

The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So that's a diene, right? 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. Wait, the structure is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the cyclopentadiene has methyl groups on all four carbons, which are 1,2,3,4 positions. So the structure is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on each of the four carbons involved in the double bonds.

Wait, actually, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. So with substituents on 1,2,3,4 positions, the molecule would be highly substituted. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a very strained molecule, but that's not the point.

The reaction between the anhydride and the diene is likely a Diels-Alder reaction. Because anhydrides can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. So the anhydride is the dienophile, and the tetramethylcyclopentadiene is the diene.

So, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile and the diene substituents.

Wait, but the products could be two different products. So, perhaps the endo rule applies, and the major product is the endo transition state. Alternatively, maybe there's some regiochemistry that leads to two different products, but I'm not sure.

But the key thing here is the NMR data, particularly the NOESY cross-peaks. In the major product, the cross-peak suggests that two protons are close in space, indicating a possibility of a gauche arrangement, perhaps in a six-membered chair-like transition state, but more importantly, in the product structure, those protons must be on adjacent carbons or in proximity in the molecule.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder adduct, the diene becomes the four-membered part of the ring, and the dienophile becomes the endo part. So, the substituents from the dienophile would be on adjacent positions in the adduct.

In any case, the NMR data can help us figure out the structure.

The question is about the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY. The cross-peak indicates that the two protons are close in space, so they must be on adjacent atoms or in a close spatial arrangement, such as in a trans-diaxial arrangement in a six-membered ring.

So, looking at the options, the possible pairings are:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

Hmm, 6H singlet at 1 ppm is likely a set of equivalent methyl groups, maybe attached to a structure that's symmetric. The 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm could be a proton adjacent to a CH2 group or something.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet could be two methyl groups, each with three H's, making a total of six. Wait, but wait, 6H would be two CH3 groups, but they're singlets, so no splitting. The 2H singlet at 3.5 is possibly two equivalent protons, maybe on an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an OCH2 group.

Option C: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. That would be two sets of methyl groups, perhaps. For example, two CH3 groups each split into a singlet.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. A doublet at 1.5 ppm suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and the 2H singlet could be an OCH2 group.

But how does this relate to the NOESY cross-peak? In the major product, a cross-peak exists between two resonances. So these two protons must be near each other in space.

Let me think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So when it reacts with the anhydride (the dienophile), the product would have substituents from the dienophile attached to the adduct.

Wait, the anhydride is a dienophile. So the structure of the adduct would incorporate the anhydride's carbonyl groups into the new six-membered ring. So each carbonyl from the anhydride becomes part of the ring as an ester or anhydride oxygen.

Wait, when an anhydride undergoes Diels-Alder, the dienophile would be the anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile. So the product would have an oxygen bridge between two carbons, perhaps, or two ester groups.

But I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Let me think about the molecular formula. The product has C13H16O3. The starting anhydride must have a certain formula. Let me calculate.

The starting anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is CnH2nO4 (since each carboxylic acid is -COOH, so two would be O4). Dehydration to anhydride would lose H2O, so the formula would be CnH2n-2O3.

Then, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The formula of the diene: cyclopentadiene has five carbons. 1,3-cyclopentadiene is C5H6. With four methyl groups, it becomes C5 + 4*(CH3) = C9H10.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-cyclopentadiene has five carbons, and adding four methyl groups would add four more, making nine. Each methyl is CH3, so four CH3 groups add 4*3=12 H's. But cyclopentadiene has 6 H's (as in C5H6). So the diene's formula is C9H10?

Wait, no. Let me recount. The cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Each methyl group is CH3, adding four methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) which is four carbons and 12 H's. So the diene would have 5+4=9 carbons and 6+12=18 H's. But wait, is that correct? Because the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has four CH2 groups and two CH groups? Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C5H6, and adding four methyl groups (each at positions 1,2,3,4) would make them CH2CH3 or similar. Wait, no, the substituents are methyl attached to the ring. So each methyl is -CH2CH3? No, wait, no, the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring. So the structure is cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Wait, but each of those positions is either part of the double bonds or not. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So, if positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group, that's four methyl groups attached to the ring.

So the formula of the diene would be C5 (ring) + 4*(CH3) = C5+4= C9. Hydrogen count: each CH3 contributes 3 H's, so 4*3=12 H's. The ring itself, without substituents, is C5H6 (since it's a conjugated diene, which has 6 H's). So adding four methyl groups would add 12 H's, making total H's = 6+12=18? But that can't be right because each substitution would replace a hydrogen on the ring.

Wait, more accurately, the parent cyclopentadiene (C5H6) has 6 H's. Each substitution of a methyl group (-CH3) removes one H from the ring and adds three H's from the methyl. Since there are four methyl groups, each substitution adds 2 H's (3-1=2 per substitution). So 4 substitutions add 4 * 2 = 8 H's. So the diene would have 6 + 8 = 14 H's. So the formula is C9H14?

Wait, but the products have molecular formula C13H16O3. Let's see: the diene is C9H14, the anhydride would have to supply the remaining carbons and oxygens.

The anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is C_x H_{2x} O4. Dehydration to anhydride would make it C_x H_{2x-2} O3.

So when the anhydride (C_x H_{2x-2} O3) reacts with the diene (C9H14), the product is C_{x+9} H_{(2x-2)+14} O3.

Wait, but wait. The product formula is C13H16O3. So:

x+9 =13 â x=4.

So the acid is C4H8O4. So the anhydride would be C4H6O3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the dicarboxylic acid is C4H6O4? No, wait, when a dicarboxylic acid dehydrates, it loses a water molecule. The formula of the acid would be C4H6O4. Wait, but a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid is like adipic acid, which is HOOC(CH2)4COOH. That's C6H10O4, not C4.

Wait, maybe the acid is something else. Let me think. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's a four-carbon molecule with a double bond. For example, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So that's C4H4O4.

Dehydration of fumaric acid would form maleic anhydride, which is the cyclic anhydride. The formula would be C4H2O3.

So when maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) reacts with the diene (C9H14), what's the product?

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and a diene typically forms a six-membered ring. The adduct would have the structure where the two carbonyls from the anhydride are now part of ester groups attached to the cyclohexene ring.

So the product would have the formula C4+9 = C13, but wait, maleic anhydride is C4H2O3 and the diene is C9H14. So adding them would give C13H16O3? Let me check.

Wait, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition. So the diene (4 pi electrons) and the dienophile (2 pi electrons) combine to form a six-membered ring. The product's formula is the sum of the diene and dienophile minus two hydrogens (since the reaction forms two sigma bonds, each from a pi bond, so four pi electrons are consumed, so two H's lost? Or perhaps I should think in terms of molecular formulas.

Maleic anhydride is C4H2O3. The diene is C9H14.

So the product's formula is C4 + C9 = C13. Hydrogen: 2 (from anhydride) + 14 (from diene) = 16? Wait, but Diels-Alder forms two sigma bonds, which would involve losing two hydrogens? Or maybe not. Let me think: the diene has four pi bonds, but wait, diene is conjugated, so it's a four-pi-electron system. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) has two pi bonds. The reaction forms two new sigma bonds. So the total hydrogen count: diene (C9H14) + dienophile (C4H2O3) â product (C13H16O3). So that's correct because diene has 14 H, dienophile has 2 H, product has 16 H. So no loss of H in the product. Because the diels-alder is a concerted process that forms the six-membered ring without breaking any sigma bonds, so the H count is additive.

So the product is C13H16O3, which matches the given formula.

So the structure of the adduct would be a six-membered ring with substituents. The dienophile, maleic anhydride, contributes two carbonyl groups as substituents on the ring.

Wait, but wait. The maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride. When it reacts in Diels-Alder, the two carbonyl groups become part of the new ring. So the product would have an oxygen bridge or ester groups attached.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder adduct of maleic anhydride and a diene typically forms a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached to adjacent carbons. Let me draw it mentally.

The diene (the tetramethylcyclopentadiene) would add to the dienophile (maleic anhydride) such that the two carbonyl oxygens from the anhydride become ester groups attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, no. The structure of the adduct would have the dienophile's carbons (the two carbonyls) as part of the new six-membered ring. So each of the two carbonyl carbons from the anhydride would be connected to the ring. The oxygens would be part of the ring as ester groups.

So the structure would have a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached to adjacent carbons.

But the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So after the Diels-Alder reaction, the substituents (methyl groups) from the diene would become part of the six-membered ring.

Wait, actually, the diene is the conjugated diene, which upon reaction, becomes the four contiguous carbons in the six-membered ring. The two ends of the diene (the terminal carbons) form bonds with the dienophile.

So the product would have two substituents (from the dienophile) on adjacent carbons of the six-membered ring, and the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be on the other four carbons.

Wait, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which I think would lead to four substituents in the adduct. Or perhaps not. Let me think: the diene is cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. After reaction, the diene becomes four of the six carbons in the ring, with their substituents (the methyl groups) attached to the ring.

So the six-membered ring would have four methyl groups attached to four of the six ring carbons, and the two substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) attached to the other two.

So, the substituents from the dienophile are the two carbonyl groups, which in this case are part of the ring as ester groups or anhydride groups. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how exactly they attach.

But perhaps that's not necessary for solving the question. The key point is the NOESY cross-peak in the major product.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the dienophile (the two carbonyl groups) end up being on adjacent carbons in the ring. These substituents are probably in a cis arrangement because of the endo rule, which would place them on the same face of the ring.

Wait, the endo rule suggests that the substituents from the dienophile are oriented towards the diene in the transition state, leading to the substituents being on the same face in the product.

So in the major product (endo), the two substituents from the anhydride are on the same face of the ring. Therefore, the substituents may be cis to each other.

Now, considering the substituents from the diene. The diene has four methyl groups attached to positions 1,2,3,4. Upon forming the adduct, these become substituents on the six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the four methyl groups from the diene are on the same face of the ring as the substituents from the dienophile. Thus, in the major product, the substituents (methyl groups) are on adjacent positions to the dienophile's substituents.

But how does this relate to the NMR signals and the cross-peak?

In the product, the protons that are close in space would be those that are on adjacent carbons or in proximity. For example, a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen-bearing group (like an ester) might have protons that are close to each other, leading to a NOESY cross-peak.

Looking at the options, option B suggests a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet is likely from methyl groups (each CH3 contributing 3H, so two methyl groups sum to 6H). The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be from an OCH2 group.

If these two groups are adjacent, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The adduct would have the substituents from the dienophile (the two carbonyl oxygens) connected to the ring as ester groups. So perhaps each of those carbons has an oxygen attached, and the adjacent carbons have substituents.

Wait, but the diene's substituents (methyl groups) would be on the ring, and the dienophile's substituents (the two carbonyls) would be on adjacent carbons.

In the endo transition state, the substituents are on the same face, leading to a cis arrangement.

So, perhaps one of the methyl groups is attached to a carbon adjacent to the ester group. So the methyl group (6H singlet) is on a carbon next to an OCH2 group (2H singlet). If the OCH2 group is connected to the ester, then the methyl and the OCH2 would be adjacent, leading to a cross-peak in NOESY.

Alternatively, if the OCH2 is axial and the methyl is equatorial, but that's more about axial-equatorial relationships.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the major product would show these as separate signals. The 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm is likely two methyl groups (each as a triplet or singlet, but they're equivalent, so singlet). The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps.

If the major product has these two groups adjacent, then the protons in the methyl groups would be close to the OCH2 protons, leading to a cross-peak.

Looking at the options, option B is a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. That would mean these two sets of protons are near each other in space, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Alternatively, could it be option D? 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. But if the 2H is near a CH group, perhaps.

But based on the cross-peak being present only in the major product, which is formed via the endo transition state, the substituents are arranged such that the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, leading to that cross-peak.

So, the two protons (or groups) that are connected are the 6H singlet (from two methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (from OCH2). So the cross-peak would be between these two.

Looking at the options, option B says 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. That would fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key difference between the products is the presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The dicarboxylic acid likely forms a cyclic anhydride, such as maleic anhydride, which has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR spectrum (indicating equivalent protons) and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its 13C NMR spectrum (indicating two carbonyl carbons).

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (dienophile) forms a six-membered ring. The major product follows the endo rule, where the substituents from the dienophile (carbonyl groups) are oriented cis to each other on the same face of the ring. The diene contributes four methyl groups and forms the remaining four carbons of the ring.

3. **Molecular Formula and Structure**:  
   The molecular formula of the products is C13H16O3. The anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H14) combine to form the product. The major product has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (from the anhydride) and four methyl groups (from the diene) as substituents.

4. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product indicates spatial proximity between two sets of protons. This is consistent with the endo arrangement, where the methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the oxygen-bearing group (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) are adjacent in the six-membered ring.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of the protons in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This matches the expected proximity between the methyl groups and the oxygen-bearing group in the major product.  
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two separate methyl groups, which is inconsistent with the NOESY cross-peak.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of the protons.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (oxygen-bearing group). This corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
