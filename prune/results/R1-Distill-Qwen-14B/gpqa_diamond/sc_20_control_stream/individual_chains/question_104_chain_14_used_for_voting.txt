Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

Alright, so the setup: there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV shifts detected are different: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) ? No, perhaps I should think differently. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should recall the exact formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (2πG / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, since both planets have similar masses to Neptune and their stars are similar to the Sun, M_p and M_star are the same for both cases. Also, the inclination i is probably similar (but I'm not sure if it's the same for both; the question doesn't specify, so maybe it's assumed to be the same or sin i is the same for both). So, perhaps the ratio of their velocities K would relate to the cube root of the inverse of their orbital periods.

Wait, looking at the equation again, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) multiplied by some constants.

So, if K1 is the velocity for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_star1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p2 / M_star2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2 = Sun's mass, this simplifies to:

K1/K2 = (1/ (P1^(1/3)) ) * (P2^(1/3)) )

Which is ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, in this problem, the shifts are given. Let me make sure what the shifts correspond to. The problem says the periodic wavelength shift is 5 milliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2. The RV method's measured quantity is the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is proportional to velocity. So K is proportional to the measured shift in wavelength (since the wavelength shift Δλ is proportional to velocity via the Doppler effect: Δλ/λ0 ≈ v/c, so v ≈ c * Δλ / λ0. Since λ0 is the rest wavelength, which is the same for both measurements, the ratio of velocities K1 and K2 is the same as the ratio of Δλ1 and Δλ2.

Wait, no. Because for each star, the same spectral line is being used, so the rest wavelength λ0 is the same for both. Thus, the ratio of their velocities (K1/K2) is equal to (Δλ1 / Δλ2).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.714.

But from earlier, we had K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), so (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7.

Let me write this ratio as (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because from the equation:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, or am I getting this the other way around?

Wait, let me re-express the earlier equation correctly. Earlier, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, I think I may have messed up the algebra. Let's go back.

We have K proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

So K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / (M_star1^(2/3) P1^(1/3)) ) ] / [ (M_p2 / (M_star2^(2/3) P2^(1/3)) ) ]

Since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, this simplifies to:

K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Which can be written as (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me double-check:

Wait, the denominator is (P1)^(1/3), numerator is (P2)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Wait, no, because:

K1 is proportional to 1/(P1^(1/3)),

K2 is proportional to 1/(P2^(1/3)),

so K1/K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Which is (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, if K1 is smaller than K2, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) is less than 1, so P2 < P1.

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7: K1 < K2. So (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2 = 5/7.

Which is less than 1, so P2 < P1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1? So P2 / P1 = ?

We have:

K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3

Compute that: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning planet #2's orbital period is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of #2 is shorter than that of #1 by a factor of about 0.36. So the period of #2 is longer than #1? No, wait, 0.36 times means it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 = 0.36 P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so P1 is longer than P2 by a factor of 1/0.36 ≈ 2.78.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, so the period of planet #2 is shorter by a factor of 0.36. So the answer would be 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is, the shift detected for planet #2 is larger (7) than for #1 (5). So K2 is larger than K1. From the formula, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because if P is smaller, the same mass would cause a larger K, since K ~ 1/P^(1/3).

So, P2 is smaller, so the question is: how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, the period of #2 is 0.36 times that of #1, which is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which would make the period of #2 approximately 0.36 times as long as #1's. So #2's period is shorter, meaning that #2 is orbiting more quickly.

So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be option A, ~0.36.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I'm not messing up the ratio.

If I have (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364, so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter. So P2 is 0.36 times P1.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So how many times longer is it? It's not longer; it's shorter. So the question is, are they asking how many times longer is P2 than P1 (so if P2 is shorter, the answer is less than 1, which would be 0.36 times as long). So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.

But wait, the question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). Since the planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is related to the cube root of the inverse of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Equating this to the cube root expression:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36 times longer**.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

K ≈ [ (2πG / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

So, if K1 is the velocity for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_star1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p2 / M_star2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2 = Sun's mass, this simplifies to:

K1/K2 = (1/ (P1^(1/3)) ) * (P2^(1/3)) )

Which is ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Because for each star, the same spectral line is being used, so the rest wavelength λ0 is the same for both. Thus, the ratio of their velocities (K1/K2) is equal to (Δλ1 / Δλ2).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.714.

But from earlier, we had K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), so (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7.

Let me write this ratio as (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because from the equation:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, no, let me double-check:

Wait, the denominator is (P1)^(1/3), numerator is (P2)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Wait, no, because:

K2 is proportional to 1/(P2^(1/3)),

so K1/K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Which is (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, if K1 is smaller than K2, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) is less than 1, so P2 < P1.

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7: K1 < K2. So (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2 = 5/7.

Which is less than 1, so P2 < P1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1? So P2 / P1 = ?

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so P1 is longer than P2 by a factor of 1/0.36 ≈ 2.78.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, so the period of planet #2 is shorter by a factor of 0.36. So the answer would be 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is, the shift detected for planet #2 is larger (7) than for #1 (5). So K2 is larger than K1.

Because if P is smaller, the same mass would cause a larger K, since K ~ 1/P^(1/3).

So, P2 is smaller, so the question is: how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, the period of #2 is 0.36 times that of #1, which is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which would make the period of #2 approximately 0.36 times as long as #1's. So #2's period is shorter, meaning that #2 is orbiting more quickly.

So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be option A, ~0.36.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I'm not messing up the ratio.

If I have (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364, so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter. So P2 is 0.36 times P1.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So how many times longer is it? It's not longer; it's shorter. So the question is, are they asking how many times longer is P2 than P1 (so if P2 is shorter, the answer is less than 1, which would be 0.36 times as long). So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.

But wait, the question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). Since the planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is related to the cube root of the inverse of their orbital periods:

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Equating this to the cube root expression:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36 times longer**.

Answer: A
