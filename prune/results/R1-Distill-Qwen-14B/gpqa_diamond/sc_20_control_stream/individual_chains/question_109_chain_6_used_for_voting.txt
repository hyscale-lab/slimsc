Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's see what I can remember. The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Oh right, Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this equation T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the final state after emission has T(NN) = 0. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The options are A to D, each with different transitions. I remember that when a particle is emitted, the angular momentum has to be conserved. Also, parity is conserved in strong interactions, but since this is a strong process, parity should be conserved here.

The initial state is 1S0. So the total spin S of the NN system is 0 because the term is 1S0, so 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is 0 because it's an S state. So the initial angular momentum J is L + S, but since both are zero, J is 0.

When they emit a particle X, the final state is the NN in some state, and X in some state. The problem says the final NN state has T=0. The equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Let's plug in T=0: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

Wait, but what's the spin S and orbital L of the final NN state? Let me think. The initial state is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0. The emitted particle X has some angular momentum state, say l, and the NN system would have L' and S' such that the total angular momentum is conserved.

So the total initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0. After emission, the total J_final must also be 0.

But wait, the system is emitting a particle, so the total angular momentum after should equal the initial. So the NN system plus X should have total J=0. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that ties in yet.

Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to a state like 7D1, so let's parse those. The notation is 2S+1 L J. So for example, 7D1 would be 2S+1=7 → S=3, L=D which is 2, J=1.

Wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 7D1, 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D=2. So J = 3 (from spin) plus 2 (orbital) → but wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is S + L. So for 7D1, J could be 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Oh wait, no, the J is given as 1 in that case. So the total J for the NN is 1.

Wait no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So 7D1 would have S=3, L=2, and J=1. But wait, that's only possible if the coupling S and L gives J=1. So 3 and 2 can combine to J=5,4,3,2,1. So that's allowed.

But what about the parity? The initial parity for the NN state is 1S0. The parity is (-1)^L. Since L=0, parity is 1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity of -1. So when considering parity conservation, the product of the parity of the initial state and the parity of X should equal the parity of the final state.

Wait, the initial state is the NN system with parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. L_initial is 0, so P_initial = 1. The emitted particle X has parity P_X = -1. The final state is the NN in some state and X in some state. The parity of the final state (NN) would be P_final_NN = (-1)^(L_final_NN). The parity of X would be P_X. So the total parity after emission should be P_final_NN * P_X. Since parity is conserved, this should equal the initial parity.

So, 1 = P_final_NN * (-1). So P_final_NN * (-1) = 1 → P_final_NN = -1. So the parity of the final NN state is -1, which means (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd. So L_final is odd.

So the final NN state has L being odd. Now, the equation from Pauli's statistics: T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity.

But wait, the spin S of the NN system after emission is determined by their coupling. Because the initial total spin is 0, and the emitted particle has some spin. But wait, the spin of the emitted particle would contribute to the total spin, but in the final state, the NN system's spin is S'. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of isospin and angular momentum conservation.

Wait, isospin is a bit tricky for me. The initial state is 1S0, so the spin is S=0. After emission, the NN system's spin is S' and orbital angular momentum L'. The emitted particle X has some angular momentum, say l, which would be part of the total angular momentum.

But maybe I should look at each option and check the conditions.

Let's check each option:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the initial is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. The final NN state is 7D1. Which is (2S+1)=7 → S=3, L=D=2, J=1.

So the final NN has S=3, L=2, J=1. The emitted particle is p (proton?), which I think is a spin-1/2 particle. So the angular momentum of the emitted proton is l. Let's think about the angular momentum conservation.

Total initial J is 0. So the final state's total J must be 0. The NN has J=1, and the emitted particle has J_p. So the sum of the NN's J and the proton's J must be zero. So J_NN + J_p = 0 → J_p must be 0. But protons are spin-1/2, so J_p can be 1/2. Hmm, this might not add up. Wait, maybe I'm mixing the orbital and spin angular momentum here.

Wait, the emission is a process where the NN system emits a particle via some interaction, which would involve both orbital (angular momentum) and spin. That's getting complicated. Maybe I should use angular momentum addition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the parity condition and the Pauli equation condition.

The parity condition: The initial parity is 1. The emitted X has parity -1. So the final NN state must have parity P_NN = -1. Which means L_final must be odd. As in the earlier conclusion.

In option A, the final L is D=2, which is even. So L=2 is even. That would make P_NN = (-1)^2 = 1. But earlier, we found that P_NN must be -1 to satisfy parity conservation. So option A would have P_NN=1, which doesn't match. So option A is not allowed. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the parity of the final state is P_final_NN = (-1)^(L_final). So if the final L is 2, P = 1. X has parity -1. So total parity would be 1 * (-1) = -1. But initial parity is 1. So 1 ≠ -1. So parity is not conserved. So option A violates parity conservation. Hence, it's not allowed.

Wait, but the question is about which partial wave isn't permitted. So if any option violates either parity or angular momentum conditions, it's invalid.

So let's check each option against parity first.

Option A: 7D1 → L=2, which is even → P_NN=1. X has parity -1. So 1 * (-1) = -1. Initial parity is 1. So 1 ≠ -1 → parity not conserved. So A is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1. So L=0 (S state). So P_NN = (-1)^0 = 1. X has parity -1. So 1 * (-1) = -1. Initial parity is 1. Doesn't match. So parity not conserved. So B is not allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial parity is 1, and the product of the final NN parity and X's parity should be 1. So 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN must be -1. So only when the final NN has P=-1, which requires L being odd. So which options have L odd?

Let me list each option:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (even). P_NN=1 → 1*(-1) =-1. Initial is 1. So 1≠-1. Not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 (even). P_NN=1 → same as A. Not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2 (even). Wait, D is 2, so L=2. So same as A and B. P_NN=1. So same issue. So 1*(-1) =-1. No match. So C is also parity not conserved.

Wait, but wait. No, option C's final state is 3D3. So L=2. So P_NN would be 1. So same as above.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 (P is 1). So P_NN = (-1)^1 = -1. Then, product is (-1)*(-1)=1. Which matches initial parity. So D is allowed.

Wait, but all options except D have L even, which would make P_NN=1, leading to P_total= -1. That doesn't match initial P=1. So only D has L=1, which gives P_NN=-1, product is 1, matching initial.

So that would mean that only option D is allowed in terms of parity. So the other options (A, B, C) violate parity conservation and thus are forbidden. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is one of them. But wait, the options are about the angular momentum state of X. So each option ends with the type of X: p, p, f, s.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read the question. The options show which particle is emitted. For example, option A: ... + p. So X is a proton (p), which has spin 1/2 and parity -1.

But the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So each option has a certain L for the emitted X.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the angular momentum of X and the NN. Let me clarify.

The problem is about the partial wave of X, meaning the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So the orbital angular momentum l of X determines the partial wave (s, p, d, f, etc.) which is the lowercase letter in the option.

So for example, option A ends with 'p', which is l=1.

So for each option, X has angular momentum l. The NN's final state has L', and their orbital angular momentum must be such that the total (NN's L' and X's l) plus their spins combine to total J=0.

But perhaps it's better to think about the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. So the orbital part (l) of the X's angular momentum.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on how to approach this. Let me try a different approach.

We know that the initial state has J=0. The final state must have the NN system and X with total J=0. So the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum should be zero. But angular momentum is a vector, so their magnitudes and directions must cancel out.

But for orbital angular momentum, we can think in terms of addition. The orbital angular momentum of the NN (L') and X (l) must add up to zero modulo conservation? Not exactly, because the total angular momentum includes spin as well. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN is L'. Since the process is emission, the orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission would be L', and X has l. The initial orbital angular momentum was 0, so L' - l must be zero? Or perhaps the sum of L' and l (as vectors) should be zero. Which would mean L'=l, but since it's a vector, their directions could be opposite, but in magnitude they are equal.

Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is the orbital part of the NN system, which is 0 (since it's 1S0). After emission, the NN has L' and X has l. The total orbital angular momentum is L' + l (vector sum). Since the initial orbital angular momentum was zero, the total after must also be zero. So L' + l = 0 → L' = -l. But since angular momentum is quantized, this would require that L' and l have the same magnitude but opposite directions. But for each, their quantum numbers (L and l) are non-negative, so L' must equal l in magnitude. So L' = l.

Wait no, that's not the case. The orbital angular momentum of the system after is L', and X has l. The sum of their orbital angular momenta must be zero because the initial was zero. So L' + l =0 → L' = -l. But since L' and l are magnitudes, they are positive, so L' = l. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission is equal to l.

But wait, the orbital angular momentum is a vector, so for their sum to be zero, they must be opposite. So L' = l and opposite direction. But in quantum numbers, the magnitude is the same. So L' = l.

So that's an important point. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission is l (same as X's orbital angular momentum).

Wait, but the NN's final state has L' = l, because their orbital angular momentum must add up to zero with X's orbital angular momentum. Or wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the total after must be zero. So the sum of the NN's orbital L' and X's orbital l must be zero. So L' = l, but opposite direction. But in quantum mechanics, the orbital angular momentum is represented by quantum numbers, which are non-negative. So |L' - l| ≤ L' + l. But for their sum to be zero, L' must equal l and the direction must be opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, L' and l can be any value, but their sum must be zero. So the only way is that L' = l and they are opposite in direction, but since they're quantum numbers, we can't have negative values. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that L' and l must be such that their vector sum is zero, meaning that L' must equal l in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, their magnitudes would be the same, but the direction is determined by the angular part. But this might not influence the parity condition.

Wait, earlier I found that the final NN's orbital angular momentum L' must be odd because their parity is -1. So L' is odd.

But from the earlier conclusion, L' = l. So l must be odd. Because L' = l and L' is odd.

So l must be odd. So the allowed l values are 1,3,5, etc. So the partial waves allowed are p (l=1), f (l=3), etc. But s is l=0 (even), d is l=2 (even), so these would have l even, which would make L' even, leading to P_NN = 1, which we found is a problem. So if l is even, then L' is even, P_NN=1. But we need P_NN =-1, so l must be odd.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: X is p (l=1) → l is odd → allowed.

Option B: X is p (l=1) → allowed.

Option C: X is f → l=3 (odd) → allowed.

Option D: X is s → l=0 (even) → not allowed.

Because in option D, l=0 (even), so L' =0 → even → P_NN=1, which doesn't satisfy the parity condition. So the parity of the final state would be 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match the initial parity of 1. So D cannot be allowed.

Wait, but earlier when I considered parity, I concluded that only option D has L'=1 (since it's 3P0 → L'=1), which is odd, leading to P_NN =-1. So this would satisfy parity. But according to the reasoning now, the orbital angular momentum of X in option D is s (l=0), which is even. So leading to L'=0, which is even → P_NN=1, which doesn't match.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, no. Let me restate: The orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission is L' = l (because the sum of L' and l must be zero, so L' = l). So the parity of the final NN state is (-1)^(L') = (-1)^l. But earlier we concluded that P_NN must be -1, so (-1)^l = -1 → l must be odd.

So l must be odd for the parity to be correct.

So looking at each option:

Option A: X is p → l=1 (odd) → allowed.

Option B: X is p → l=1 → allowed.

Option C: X is f → l=3 (odd) → allowed.

Option D: X is s → l=0 (even) → not allowed.

So which options have X with l even? Only option D. So that's the one that's not permitted.

But wait, earlier when I considered option D's final state being 3P0, which is L'=1 (since P is l=1), and the X has l=0 (s). According to this, L' = l → 1=0? That can't be. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the reasoning. The orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission is L', and X has orbital angular momentum l. Since the initial orbital angular momentum is zero (1S0), the sum of L' and l must be zero. So vectorially, L' + l = 0 → L' = -l. But since L' and l are magnitudes, their directions must be opposite. But in quantum numbers, the magnitude is non-negative, so L' equals l in magnitude. But the direction is opposite, so in terms of quantum numbers, their orbital angular momenta are such that their vectors cancel.

But in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers, the orbital angular momentum of the NN is L', and X is l, but their sum must be zero. But how can that happen? For two vectors to sum to zero, they must have the same magnitude and opposite directions. So L' = l in magnitude. So L' must be equal to l.

But wait, that's only true for the magnitude. The actual vectors are opposite, but their quantum numbers (L and l) are just the magnitudes, which are positive integers. So L' = l.

So, L' must equal l.

So, in the final state, the NN has L' = l.

And from the parity condition, P_NN = (-1)^L' = (-1)^l.

We need this to be -1, so (-1)^l = -1 → l must be odd.

Thus, l must be odd. So X must have an orbital angular momentum l which is odd (like p: l=1, f: l=3, etc.), and even l (s, d) are not allowed.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: X is p → l=1 → allowed.

Option B: X is p → l=1 → allowed.

Option C: X is f → l=3 → allowed.

Option D: X is s → l=0 → not allowed.

So option D is the one that doesn't satisfy the parity condition because l is even (0), making P_NN =1, which doesn't match the initial parity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D's final state has L'=1 (since it's 3P0 → L'=1), but according to this, L' = l, which would mean that if X is s (l=0), then L' must be zero. So the final NN state would have L'=0, which is even → P_NN=1. Which doesn't match the required -1. So option D would have P_NN=1, which is wrong.

But option D's final state is 3P0, which implies L'=1. But according to this, L' should equal l=0. That's a contradiction. So the final state's L' would have to be zero, but 3P0 implies L'=1. So that's impossible. So option D isn't even a possible transition because L' can't be 1 if l=0. So option D is impossible because L' must equal l, which is zero. But option D's final state is 3P0, which has L'=1. So it's impossible. Therefore, option D is not allowed because it violates the orbital angular momentum condition.

So the conclusion is that option D is not allowed because X's orbital angular momentum l is zero (even), which makes the final NN state have L'=0, leading to P_NN=1, which doesn't match the required -1.

But wait, according to the earlier analysis, the only option with even l is D, so it's the one that's not allowed. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought that only option D has L' odd (because it's 3P0 → L'=1), but that's only possible if l=1 (since L'=l). So if X is s (l=0), then L' must be 0. But the final state's L' is 1, which contradicts L'=l. So this means that option D is impossible as it's violating both the orbital angular momentum and parity conditions.

So the correct partial wave that's not permitted is the one with l even, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state. This implies:
   - Total spin \( S = 0 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 1 \)).
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \) (from the spectroscopic notation \( S \)).
   - Total angular momentum \( J = L + S = 0 \).

2. **Emission of Particle X**: The NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \). The final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the Pauli statistics condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must be satisfied. Substituting \( T(NN) = 0 \), we find:
   \[
   S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]
   This means \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) must be odd.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity of the NN system is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = 1 \). After emission, the parity of the final NN state is \( P_{\text{final, NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \), and the parity of the emitted particle \( X \) is \( P_X = -1 \). Parity conservation requires:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final, NN}} \cdot P_X.
   \]
   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \) and \( P_X = -1 \), we get:
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{final, NN}} \cdot (-1) \implies P_{\text{final, NN}} = -1.
   \]
   This implies \( (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = -1 \), so \( L_{\text{final}} \) must be odd.

4. **Orbital Angular Momentum Relation**: The orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission (\( L_{\text{final}} \)) must equal the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \( X \) (\( l \)), i.e., \( L_{\text{final}} = l \). Since \( L_{\text{final}} \) must be odd for parity conservation, \( l \) must also be odd.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - \( X \) is a proton (\( l = 1 \)), which is odd. Thus, \( L_{\text{final}} = l = 1 \), satisfying both parity conservation and the Pauli condition. This is allowed.
   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - \( X \) is a proton (\( l = 1 \)), which is odd. Thus, \( L_{\text{final}} = l = 1 \), satisfying both parity conservation and the Pauli condition. This is allowed.
   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - \( X \) is a particle with \( l = 3 \), which is odd. Thus, \( L_{\text{final}} = l = 3 \), satisfying both parity conservation and the Pauli condition. This is allowed.
   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - \( X \) is a particle with \( l = 0 \), which is even. Thus, \( L_{\text{final}} = l = 0 \), leading to \( P_{\text{final, NN}} = (-1)^0 = 1 \), which violates parity conservation. Additionally, \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 0 + 0 = 0 \), which does not satisfy the Pauli condition \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). This is not allowed.

6. **Conclusion**: The partial wave that is not permitted is the one where \( l = 0 \), corresponding to option D.

**Answer: D**
