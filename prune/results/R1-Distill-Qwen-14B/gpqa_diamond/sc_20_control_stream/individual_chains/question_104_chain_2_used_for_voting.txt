Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the planets have similar masses. Both planets are in circular orbits, so no eccentricity to complicate things.

The data given is about the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods of the planets. How does the shift relate to the period?

I think the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is what's measured here. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. But wait, the shift is in wavelength, not velocity. Oh right, the Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength to velocity. The formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So, the shift in wavelength is proportional to velocity.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity, which relates to the observed spectral line shift. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 mA, and Planet #2 is 7 mA. So, K1 is proportional to 5, K2 to 7.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV method depends on several factors: the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period. The formula for K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_p^3 sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * something else... Wait, maybe I can recall the formula for K.

Wait, no. Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (2 π G) / (c T) ) ]^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, but the star is Sun-like, so about 333,000 Earth masses), M_p can be considered negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, there's a simplified version when M_p << M_star. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, maybe not. Another thought: The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (27 * pi) / (2 * c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi) / (2 c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and P. If all else is equal (like M_p, M_star, and sin i), then K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. The RV method depends on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's orbital motion. The star's velocity is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( a (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Using Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses.

Kepler's third law is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * a³ (M_star + M_p) )^(-1) * (4π² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So, a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

But the RV method also gives K, the semi-amplitude, which relates to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) * a ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π/P) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this problem, the two planets have the same mass, same star mass, and the same sin i (since the shifts are given without any info about inclination, but both are detected, so sin i isn't zero, but same for both).

So, for both planets, (M_p sin i) is the same, M_star is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which means, P ∝ 1 / (K)^(3)

Wait, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K, so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, P1 / P2 = (K2 / K1 )^3

Because K1 = (v1) and K2 = (v2). So P1 = (K2^3)/(K1^3) * P2.

Wait, let's see. Let me make it precise.

Given that K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), and K2 proportional to 1/P2^(1/3), then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

Therefore, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, no. Let me write it down step by step.

K1 ∝ 1 / P1^(1/3)

K2 ∝ 1 / P2^(1/3)

So, K1 = A / P1^(1/3)

K2 = A / P2^(1/3)

Where A is the same for both because M_p and M_star are same, and sin i is same. So, dividing the two equations:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Therefore, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3

Now, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, (P2 / P1) = ?

From the equation, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of the periods. Suppose K1 is 5 and K2 is7.

So, K1 =5, K2=7.

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1, which means P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, but wait—no, no. Because P2/P1 is 0.364, that means P2 is 0.364 * P1, so P2 is shorter than P1. Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, meaning P2 is 0.364 times P1, so about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but wait, that would mean that planet #2 has a shorter period. But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The question is, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if P2 is longer than P1, then the ratio is P2/P1 = x, where x>1.

But according to our earlier calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is less than 1. So P2 is shorter than P1. That would mean that planet #2 orbits much faster, closer to the star. So the period of planet #2 is shorter by a factor of about 0.36 times.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

The question is, how many times longer P2 is than P1. So, if P2 is shorter, then P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.

But the question is phrased as, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that's 36% of P1, so P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps I mixed up K1 and K2.

Wait, the question says:

Planet #1's shift is 5 mA.

Planet #2's shift is 7 mA.

So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

From earlier, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So, longer by a factor of 0.364. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #1 has a longer period. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long. So planet #2 has a shorter period.

Wait, the question is phrased as, the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than planet #1 by how much. So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's think about K being inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3) × P1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/(K)^3.

So, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

So, P1 / P2 = (K2^3) / (K1^3)

So, P1 = (K2^3 / K1^3) × P2.

So, P2 = P1 × (K1^3 / K2^3).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If P ∝ 1/(K^3), then P1 = C / K1^3, P2 = C / K2^3, where C is a constant.

So, the ratio P2 / P1 is (C/K2^3) / (C/K1^3) ) = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, given K1 =5, K2=7.

So, (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So, the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the period of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that would mean it's shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, hence option A.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is shorter than P1, then it is not longer. So, the correct answer would be that planet #2's period is shorter, so the question's phrasing implies that it is longer. Hmm... Did I get the formula right?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) )

Wait, T is the orbital period?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) * c )

But since M_p << M_star, this becomes K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * c) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K)^3.

So, P1 = C / K1^3, P2 = C / K2^3.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Thus, P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as planet #1's.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if it's 0.36 times, then it's 36% the length. So it's not longer, it's shorter. So the options don't have a negative number, so the correct answer must be 0.36 times as long, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait. The question asks, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's actually shorter. So the answer would be 0.36 times, but that makes it shorter.

Hmm, perhaps I got the ratio the wrong way. Let me make sure. K1 is the velocity amplitude for planet #1.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then a higher K implies a shorter period.

So, Planet #2 has a higher K (7 mA vs 5 mA), so it must have a shorter period.

So, the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? The answer is less than 1, which would be option A (0.36).

Wait, but let me re-express the formula again. Maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, P is proportional to (1/(K))^3.

So, P1 = C / (K1)^3.

P2 = C / (K2)^3.

So, P2 / P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3).

Given K1=5, K2=7.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1.

Therefore, P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364.

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So, if the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- Planet #1 has a spectral line shift corresponding to \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \).
- Planet #2 has a spectral line shift corresponding to \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \).

The ratio of the orbital periods is given by:
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36 times**, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the planets have similar masses. Both planets are in circular orbits, so no eccentricity to complicate things.

The data given is about the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods of the planets. How does the shift relate to the period?

I think the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is what's measured here. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. But wait, the shift is in wavelength, not velocity. Oh right, the Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength to velocity. The formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So, the shift in wavelength is proportional to velocity.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity, which relates to the observed spectral line shift. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 mA, and Planet #2 is 7 mA. So, K1 is proportional to 5, K2 to 7.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV method depends on several factors: the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period. The formula for K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_p^3 sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * something else... Wait, maybe I can recall the formula for K.

Wait, no. Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (2 π G) / (c T) ) ]^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, but the star is Sun-like, so about 333,000 Earth masses), M_p can be considered negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, there's a simplified version when M_p << M_star. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, maybe not. Another thought: The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (27 * pi) / (2 * c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi) / (2 c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and P. If all else is equal (like M_p, M_star, and sin i), then K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. The RV method depends on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's orbital motion. The star's velocity is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( a (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Using Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses.

Kepler's third law is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * a³ (M_star + M_p) )^(-1) * (4π² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So, a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

But the RV method also gives K, the semi-amplitude, which relates to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) * a ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π/P) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this problem, the two planets have the same mass, same star mass, and the same sin i (since the shifts are given without any info about inclination, but both are detected, so sin i isn't zero, but same for both).

So, for both planets, (M_p sin i) is the same, M_star is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which means, P ∝ 1 / (K)^(3)

Wait, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K, so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, P1 / P2 = (K2 / K1 )^3

Because K1 = (v1) and K2 = (v2). So P1 = (K2^3)/(K1^3) * P2.

Wait, let's see. Let me make it precise.

Given that K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), and K2 proportional to 1/P2^(1/3), then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

Therefore, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, no. Let me write it down step by step.

K1 ∝ 1 / P1^(1/3)

K2 ∝ 1 / P2^(1/3)

So, K1 = A / P1^(1/3)

K2 = A / P2^(1/3)

Where A is the same for both because M_p and M_star are same, and sin i is same. So, dividing the two equations:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Therefore, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3

Now, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, (P2 / P1) = ?

From the equation, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of the periods. Suppose K1 is 5 and K2 is7.

So, K1 =5, K2=7.

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1, which means P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, but wait—no, no. Because P2/P1 is 0.364, that means P2 is 0.364 * P1, so P2 is shorter than P1. Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, meaning P2 is 0.364 times P1, so about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but wait, that would mean that planet #2 has a shorter period. But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The question is, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if P2 is longer than P1, then the ratio is P2/P1 = x, where x>1.

But according to our earlier calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is less than 1. So P2 is shorter than P1. That would mean that planet #2 orbits much faster, closer to the star. So the period of planet #2 is shorter by a factor of about 0.36 times.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

The question is, how many times longer P2 is than P1. So, if P2 is shorter, then P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.

But the question is phrased as, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that's 36% of P1, so P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps I mixed up K1 and K2.

Wait, the question says:

Planet #1's shift is 5 mA.

Planet #2's shift is 7 mA.

So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

From earlier, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So, longer by a factor of 0.364. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #1 has a longer period. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long. So planet #2 has a shorter period.

Wait, the question is phrased as, the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than planet #1 by how much. So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's think about K being inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3) × P1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/(K)^3.

So, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

So, P1 / P2 = (K2^3) / (K1^3)

So, P1 = (K2^3 / K1^3) × P2.

So, P2 = P1 × (K1^3 / K2^3).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If P ∝ 1/(K^3), then P1 = C / K1^3, P2 = C / K2^3, where C is a constant.

So, the ratio P2 / P1 is (C/K2^3) / (C/K1^3) ) = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, given K1 =5, K2=7.

So, (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So, the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the period of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that would mean it's shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, hence option A.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is shorter than P1, then it is not longer. So, the correct answer would be that planet #2's period is shorter, so the question's phrasing implies that it is longer. Hmm... Did I get the formula right?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) )

Wait, T is the orbital period?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) * c )

But since M_p << M_star, this becomes K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * c) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K)^3.

So, P1 = C / K1^3, P2 = C / K2^3.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Thus, P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as planet #1's.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if it's 0.36 times, then it's 36% the length. So it's not longer, it's shorter. So the options don't have a negative number, so the correct answer must be 0.36 times as long, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait. The question asks, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's actually shorter. So the answer would be 0.36 times, but that makes it shorter.

Hmm, perhaps I got the ratio the wrong way. Let me make sure. K1 is the velocity amplitude for planet #1.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then a higher K implies a shorter period.

So, Planet #2 has a higher K (7 mA vs 5 mA), so it must have a shorter period.

So, the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? The answer is less than 1, which would be option A (0.36).

Wait, but let me re-express the formula again. Maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, P is proportional to (1/(K))^3.

So, P1 = C / (K1)^3.

P2 = C / (K2)^3.

So, P2 / P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3).

Given K1=5, K2=7.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1.

Therefore, P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364.

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So, if the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- Planet #1 has a spectral line shift corresponding to \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \).
- Planet #2 has a spectral line shift corresponding to \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \).

The ratio of the orbital periods is given by:
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36 times**, corresponding to option A.
