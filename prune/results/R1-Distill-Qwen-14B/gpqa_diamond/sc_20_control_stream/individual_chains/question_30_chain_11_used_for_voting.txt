Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh wait, that's the whole thing about complementary colors, right?

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So, I need to figure out which color is absorbed. I think the absorbed light is the one that corresponds to the energy gap, and the emitted light is the complementary color.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. When a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between the molecule's electron states. The emitted light is usually at a longer wavelength than the absorbed one because of the energy difference. Or wait, no, sometimes it's the opposite. I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, no. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. Because when the molecule gets excited and then emits a photon, that photon has lower energy. So maybe the emitted light is the complementary color of the absorbed one? Or do I need to calculate the wavelength first?

Right, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, I can find the emitted wavelength. Then, since the absorbed wavelength is probably the one that corresponds to this energy gap, so the absorbed light would have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule absorbs a photon (of a certain energy), which excites an electron to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back, it emits a photon. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed one. So the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than the emitted wavelength.

Wait, but wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So that's the emitted energy. So the absorbed energy must be higher than that. So the emitted color is what's left after absorption. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher, so the wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed light would be in the violet or blue range, perhaps.

Wait, let me calculate the emitted wavelength first. So E = 2.3393 eV. Converting that to Joules: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

Now, using E = hc/λ. Solve for λ:

λ = hc / E.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3.0e8 m/s.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (3.745e-19) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) = approx 5.306e-7 meters, which is 530.6 nm. Wait, that's green, I think. Because green is around 530 nm. But wait, the options don't have green as an option. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. Oh wait, no, the question says that the dye emits light with that energy. So the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Hmm, so none of the options is green. So maybe I did something wrong. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of complementary colors. Because when a compound absorbs a certain color, it doesn't emit that color. So if it emits green, then it must have absorbed the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option either. Wait, the color wheel: complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, etc. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must be red's complement. Wait, no, maybe the other way around.

Wait, another approach. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy absorbed is higher than that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's of higher energy than what it emits. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So, let's compute the wavelength of the emitted light. E = hc/λ.

E = 2.3393 eV. Let me just compute λ in nanometers.

We can use the formula: λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV). Because 1240 eV·nm is hc in eV·nm units.

So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ approximately 530 nm. That's green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the compound absorbs the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Because sometimes, the absorbed wavelength is the energy gap, and the emitted is lower. So if the compound emits green, the absorbed wavelength would be higher energy than green. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

But the options given are A) Red (about 650-700 nm), B) Violet (400-450), C) Blue (450-500), D) Yellow (570-590). Wait, but 530 is green, which is between blue and yellow.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absorbed light, which is the energy gap. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy of the transition.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between absorption and emission. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy is higher, so the wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon is of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

So the emitted is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed must be a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than that. So in the violet or blue range.

Wait, the question is, what color is absorbed? So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is the energy that caused the excitation. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than emitted.

The emitted is green (about 530 nm), so the absorbed would be a higher energy (lower wavelength), so in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, B is violet (400-450), C is blue (~450-500). So which one?

Wait, but wait. The energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E (emission) + some other energy? Or is the energy of the absorbed photon the same as the energy difference between the states, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy?

Wait, no. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it's the energy of that photon that causes the electron to jump to a higher energy level. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon with energy E_emit. So E_abs is the energy of the absorbed photon, which is higher than E_emit because some energy may be lost as heat, but assuming it's a simple transition, E_abs ≈ E_emit.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a molecule absorbs a photon of energy E and emits a photon of energy E_emit, then E_abs must be higher than E_emit. Because the absorbed energy promotes the electron to a higher state, and then when it drops, it emits E_emit. So E_abs is the energy difference, which equals E_emit plus any other energy losses, but perhaps in this ideal case, E_abs is equal to E_emit?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state. So the molecule absorbs a photon of that energy, and when it relaxes, it emits another photon of the same energy. Wait, but that can't be right because then the emitted and absorbed would be same color, but that's not the case.

Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. Because in fluorescence, the emitted photon usually has lower energy than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy.

So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted. So E_abs > E_emit.

So E_emit is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute E_abs.

Wait, but how? Because I don't have any other info. Unless the question is suggesting that the dye's absorption is at 2.3393 eV, but that's not what it says.

Wait the question says, "emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV." So that's the emitted energy. So the absorbed energy must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

So, the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm (green). So it could be blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) and C) Blue (longer than violet, but still shorter than green).

So which color has a wavelength shorter than 530 nm? Violet is around 400-450, blue about 450-500, green 500-550, yellow 570-590, red 620-750.

So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530, so either violet or blue.

Now, the question is, which color is absorbed? So the dye absorbs light at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

So, the color absorbed is either violet or blue.

But wait, the question is phrased as, "what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" Given that the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be the complementary color. Wait, but green's complement is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted. But that would lead to the same wavelength. But that would suggest the same color, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the visible spectrum and the colors absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should look for the color that is not emitted. If the dye emits green, then it's absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta. But the options don't include magenta. So perhaps the question is considering that the emitted light is the color we see, and the absorbed color is the one that's not present.

Wait another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the emitted wavelength is approximately 530 nm (green). So the compound would appear in the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed, not the color of the compound. Oh, right, the compound absorbs certain light and emits others. So if it emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), which is not present in the emitted light.

So, the absorbed color is the one with higher energy, which is violet or blue.

Looking at the options, B is violet (higher energy than blue). So if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) color. So between violet and blue, which is higher energy? Violet is higher energy than blue.

Wait, no, violet is higher energy than blue. Because violet is around 400 nm, blue around 470. So E_violet > E_blue. So if the compound emits green (530), the absorbed must be higher energy than green, which is either blue or violet.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue. But which one?

Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = hc/λ_abs. Since E_abs must be greater than E_emit (2.3393 eV), because it's the energy that excites the molecule. So the wavelength of absorbed light is λ_abs = hc / E_abs.

Since E_abs > E_emit, λ_abs < λ_emit.

So if λ_emit is 530 nm, λ_abs must be less than that, say 450 nm (blue) or 400 nm (violet).

But without knowing the exact energy gap, how can I decide between the two?

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the emitted energy is the energy gap. So E_emit is the energy of the photon that is emitted. That would correspond to the energy difference between the excited and ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have the same energy as the energy gap.

Wait, that can't be right because in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon. But that would mean the same wavelength, which would be green. But the options don't have green.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The question gives the energy emitted, and asks what color is absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy of the absorbed photon. If the emitted is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed must be higher. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV, so its wavelength is shorter.

Calculating the wavelength of the emitted photon is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than that, so either blue or violet.

Now, which of the options is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green? So between blue and violet, violet is higher energy.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps both B and C could be possible. But the options don't have both. So maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the color absorbed is the same as the energy gap. So the energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to the absorbed photon. No, because the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy gap. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that.

Wait, but that would mean that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So either blue or violet.

But the question asks which color is absorbed. So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which is it? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is in the green region, which suggests that the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

If the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is approximately 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so it's in the blue or violet range.

But without more data, perhaps the correct approach is to think that when a compound emits in the green, the absorbed light is in the blue or violet. Wait, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the dye's color is the color it doesn't absorb. So if it emits green, it must have absorbed something else. But that's getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I should just look up what color corresponds to 2.3393 eV. 530 nm is green, right? So the compound emits green. So the absorbed light must be a higher energy, so either blue or violet.

But I'm not sure whether to pick violet or blue. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength again.

Using λ = 1240 / E (in eV) → 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ around 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted color is green. So the compound must be absorbing light of a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So the question is, which is the correct absorbed color? 

Well, when you have a compound that emits green, it is because it absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), which causes it to emit green. So the absorbed color is not green but something else.

But without more info, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet because it's the higher energy than blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another angle: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So calculate the absorbed photon's energy.

But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So perhaps E_abs is the same as E_emit. But that would mean the same wavelength, which is green. But the options don't have that. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So for E_abs, let's say it's 3 eV. Then λ_abs = 1240 / 3 ≈ 413 nm, which is violet. So if the dye emits green, it absorbs violet.

So in this case, the answer would be B) Violet.

Alternatively, if E_abs is 2.8 eV, λ_abs ≈442 nm which is blue.

But without knowing E_abs, perhaps the question expects me to use the emitted color to decide the absorbed color. Since the emitted is green, the absorbed must be in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region.

So the options are violet and blue. Which one is higher in energy? Violet is higher, so perhaps the answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe the absorbed light is blue, but that's less certain.

Wait, another approach: The visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So higher energy is at the lower end (violet), lower energy at the higher end (red).

So if the emitted light is 530 nm (green), the absorbed light must be at a wavelength shorter than 530, so in the blue or violet.

So the options are B and C.

But how to choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the question is testing the concept that when a compound emits light, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon is of higher energy than the emitted.

So the emitted is green, which is 530 nm. So the absorbed is higher energy (shorter wavelength), so either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the absorption to be in the blue region because blue is the complementary color of yellow. Hmm, no, that's not right.

Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm stuck between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, as it's the higher energy option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is suggesting that the compound emits green, which is the complementary color of magenta, but since the options don't have it, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. Because when a compound emits light, the emitted color is the one that's not absorbed. So if the compound emits green, it must absorb the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But none of the options are magenta, so perhaps the answer is B) Violet, as it's the closest higher energy.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must have a higher energy than that, so its wavelength is shorter. So from the options, the colors with shorter wavelength than 530 nm are B) Violet (400-450) and C) Blue (450-500). So both are possible.

But if the question is from a textbook, perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet, because the emitted is green, and the absorbed is the higher energy violet. So I think the correct answer is B) Violet.

To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the given information. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light). This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

When a compound absorbs light, it typically absorbs a specific wavelength (energy) that excites an electron to a higher energy state. The emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the excited and ground states. Since the emitted energy is **2.3393 eV**, the absorbed energy must be higher than this value because the absorbed photon provides the energy for the excitation, and the emitted photon has lower energy.

The absorbed wavelength, therefore, must be shorter than **530 nm** (green), corresponding to either violet or blue light. Violet light has a shorter wavelength (around **400–450 nm**) and higher energy compared to blue light (around **450–500 nm**). Thus, violet light is the higher energy option.

Given the options:
- **A) Red**: Wavelengths are longer than green (620–750 nm), so this is incorrect.
- **B) Violet**: Wavelengths are shorter than green (400–450 nm), making it a valid candidate.
- **C) Blue**: Wavelengths are shorter than green but longer than violet (450–500 nm), making it less likely than violet.
- **D) Yellow**: Wavelengths are longer than green (570–590 nm), so this is incorrect.

Since violet light has a higher energy and shorter wavelength than blue, it is the most plausible choice for the absorbed light. Therefore, the compound absorbs violet light.

Answer: B

Now, using E = hc/λ. Solve for λ:

λ = hc / E.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3.0e8 m/s.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (3.745e-19) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) = approx 5.306e-7 meters, which is 530.6 nm. Wait, that's green, I think. Because green is around 530 nm. But wait, the options don't have green as an option. So maybe I made a mistake.

So, let's compute the wavelength of the emitted light. E = hc/λ.

E = 2.3393 eV. Let me just compute λ in nanometers.

We can use the formula: λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV). Because 1240 eV·nm is hc in eV·nm units.

So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ approximately 530 nm. That's green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the compound absorbs the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Because sometimes, the absorbed wavelength is the energy gap, and the emitted is lower. So if the compound emits green, the absorbed wavelength would be higher energy than green. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

But the options given are A) Red (about 650-700 nm), B) Violet (400-450), C) Blue (450-500), D) Yellow (570-590). Wait, but 530 is green, which is between blue and yellow.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absorbed light, which is the energy gap. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy of the transition.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between absorption and emission. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy is higher, so the wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon is of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. Because in fluorescence, the emitted photon usually has lower energy than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy.

So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted. So E_abs > E_emit.

So E_emit is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute E_abs.

Wait, but how? Because I don't have any other info. Unless the question is suggesting that the dye's absorption is at 2.3393 eV, but that's not what it says.

Wait the question says, "emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV." So that's the emitted energy. So the absorbed energy must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

So, the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm (green). So it could be blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) and C) Blue (longer than violet, but still shorter than green).

So which color has a wavelength shorter than 530 nm? Violet is around 400-450, blue about 450-500, green 500-550, yellow 570-590, red 620-750.

So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530, so either violet or blue.

Now, the question is, which color is absorbed? So the dye absorbs light at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

So, the color absorbed is either violet or blue.

But wait, the question is phrased as, "what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" Given that the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be the complementary color. Wait, but green's complement is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted. But that would lead to the same wavelength. But that would suggest the same color, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the visible spectrum and the colors absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should look for the color that is not emitted. If the dye emits green, then it's absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta. But the options don't include magenta. So perhaps the question is considering that the emitted light is the color we see, and the absorbed color is the one that's not present.

Wait another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the emitted wavelength is approximately 530 nm (green). So the compound would appear in the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed, not the color of the compound. Oh, right, the compound absorbs certain light and emits others. So if it emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), which is not present in the emitted light.

So, the absorbed color is the one with higher energy, which is violet or blue.

Looking at the options, B is violet (higher energy than blue). So if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) color. So between violet and blue, which is higher energy? Violet is higher energy than blue.

Wait, no, violet is higher energy than blue. Because violet is around 400 nm, blue around 470. So E_violet > E_blue. So if the compound emits green (530), the absorbed must be higher energy than green, which is either blue or violet.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue. But which one?

Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = hc/λ_abs. Since E_abs must be greater than E_emit (2.3393 eV), because it's the energy that excites the molecule. So the wavelength of absorbed light is λ_abs = hc / E_abs.

Since E_abs > E_emit, λ_abs < λ_emit.

So if λ_emit is 530 nm, λ_abs must be less than that, say 450 nm (blue) or 400 nm (violet).

But without knowing the exact energy gap, how can I decide between the two?

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the emitted energy is the energy gap. So E_emit is the energy of the photon that is emitted. That would correspond to the energy difference between the excited and ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have the same energy as the energy gap.

Wait, that can't be right because in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon. But that would mean the same wavelength, which would be green. But the options don't have green.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The question gives the energy emitted, and asks what color is absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy of the absorbed photon. If the emitted is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed must be higher. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV, so its wavelength is shorter.

Calculating the wavelength of the emitted photon is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than that, so either blue or violet.

Now, which of the options is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green? So between blue and violet, violet is higher energy.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps both B and C could be possible. But the options don't have both. So maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the color absorbed is the same as the energy gap. So the energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to the absorbed photon. No, because the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy gap. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that.

Wait, but that would mean that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So either blue or violet.

But the question asks which color is absorbed. So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which is it? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is in the green region, which suggests that the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

If the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is approximately 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so it's in the blue or violet range.

But without more data, perhaps the correct approach is to think that when a compound emits in the green, the absorbed light is in the blue or violet. Wait, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the dye's color is the color it doesn't absorb. So if it emits green, it must have absorbed something else. But that's getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I should just look up what color corresponds to 2.3393 eV. 530 nm is green, right? So the compound emits green. So the absorbed light must be a higher energy, so either blue or violet.

But I'm not sure whether to pick violet or blue. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength again.

Using λ = 1240 / E (in eV) → 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ around 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted color is green. So the compound must be absorbing light of a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So the question is, which is the correct absorbed color? 

Well, when you have a compound that emits green, it is because it absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), which causes it to emit green. So the absorbed color is not green but something else.

But without more info, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet because it's the higher energy than blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another angle: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So calculate the absorbed photon's energy.

But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So perhaps E_abs is the same as E_emit. But that would mean the same wavelength, which is green. But the options don't have that. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So for E_abs, let's say it's 3 eV. Then λ_abs = 1240 / 3 ≈ 413 nm, which is violet. So if the dye emits green, it absorbs violet.

So in this case, the answer would be B) Violet.

Alternatively, if E_abs is 2.8 eV, λ_abs ≈442 nm which is blue.

But without knowing E_abs, perhaps the question expects me to use the emitted color to decide the absorbed color. Since the emitted is green, the absorbed must be in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region.

So the options are violet and blue. Which one is higher in energy? Violet is higher, so perhaps the answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe the absorbed light is blue, but that's less certain.

Wait, another approach: The visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So higher energy is at the lower end (violet), lower energy at the higher end (red).

So if the emitted light is 530 nm (green), the absorbed light must be at a wavelength shorter than 530, so in the blue or violet.

So the options are B and C.

But how to choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the question is testing the concept that when a compound emits light, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon is of higher energy than the emitted.

So the emitted is green, which is 530 nm. So the absorbed is higher energy (shorter wavelength), so either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the absorption to be in the blue region because blue is the complementary color of yellow. Hmm, no, that's not right.

Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm stuck between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, as it's the higher energy option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is suggesting that the compound emits green, which is the complementary color of magenta, but since the options don't have it, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. Because when a compound emits light, the emitted color is the one that's not absorbed. So if the compound emits green, it must absorb the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But none of the options are magenta, so perhaps the answer is B) Violet, as it's the closest higher energy.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must have a higher energy than that, so its wavelength is shorter. So from the options, the colors with shorter wavelength than 530 nm are B) Violet (400-450) and C) Blue (450-500). So both are possible.

But if the question is from a textbook, perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet, because the emitted is green, and the absorbed is the higher energy violet. So I think the correct answer is B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the given information. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light). This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

When a compound absorbs light, it typically absorbs a specific wavelength (energy) that excites an electron to a higher energy state. The emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the excited and ground states. Since the emitted energy is **2.3393 eV**, the absorbed energy must be higher than this value because the absorbed photon provides the energy for the excitation, and the emitted photon has lower energy.

The absorbed wavelength, therefore, must be shorter than **530 nm** (green), corresponding to either violet or blue light. Violet light has a shorter wavelength (around **400–450 nm**) and higher energy compared to blue light (around **450–500 nm**). Thus, violet light is the higher energy option.

Given the options:
- **A) Red**: Wavelengths are longer than green (620–750 nm), so this is incorrect.
- **B) Violet**: Wavelengths are shorter than green (400–450 nm), making it a valid candidate.
- **C) Blue**: Wavelengths are shorter than green but longer than violet (450–500 nm), making it less likely than violet.
- **D) Yellow**: Wavelengths are longer than green (570–590 nm), so this is incorrect.

Since violet light has a higher energy and shorter wavelength than blue, it is the most plausible choice for the absorbed light. Therefore, the compound absorbs violet light.

Answer: B
