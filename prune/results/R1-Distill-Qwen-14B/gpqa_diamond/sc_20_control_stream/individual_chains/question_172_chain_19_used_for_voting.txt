Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of different energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio is (n_j)/(n_i) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's interesting because the Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so ΔE equals k, because 1.38e-23 J is exactly k when T is 1 K. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, wait, no — ΔE is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J, which is equal to k (since k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So the Boltzmann factor becomes exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) = exp(-1/(T)), because ΔE is k, so substituting, (k cancels out). So the ratio of n_j to n_i is exp(-1/T).

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So for star_1, the population is n1, and for star_2, n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Wait wait, I'm not sure. Let me read again: the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think that means that the population in the higher energy level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n_j)/(n_i) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but in the problem, the energy difference is the same for both stars. So for star_1, this ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But wait, wait. Let me clarify the setup. Let me think of it as the ratio for a particular transition. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (for example) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me think more accurately.

Let me denote the number of atoms in the higher energy level as n_j, and the lower as n_i. Then, for star_1, n_j1/n_i1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, n_j2/n_i2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that in star_1, the excited atoms (n_j) are twice those in star_2. So n_j1 = 2 * n_j2.

Wait, but I think that's not the exact setup. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps n_j1 = 2 * n_j2. But what about their n_i? Are they assuming that the lower level populations are the same? Or perhaps the ratio between the excited and the ground is twice as much in star_1?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The excitation is for a specific energy level. So perhaps n_j1 = 2 * n_j2, but we can assume that the lower level populations are the same? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is the same for both stars, so the ratio n_j/n_i depends on T. So for each star, the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But the question says that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So I think that the ratio n_j1/n_i1 = 2 * (n_j2/n_i2). Because star_1 has twice the excitation.

So (n_j1/n_i1) = 2 * (n_j2/n_i2).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n_j/n_i) for each star is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Because (n_j1/n_i1) = 2 * (n_j2/n_i2) → exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but I can substitute ΔE = k, as observed earlier. Because ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is k.

So substituting, exp(-k/(k T)) = exp(-1/T).

So equation becomes: exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2).

Taking natural logs on both sides, we get:

-1/T1 = ln(2) + (-1/T2).

Which rearranges to: (1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2).

Hmm. Let me write that as (1/T2) = (1/T1) + ln(2).

Wait, but the options are in terms of T1 and T2, so perhaps I should rearrange this equation.

Alternatively, I can write 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Wait no, wait: from the equation: -1/T1 = ln(2) -1/T2 → 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

So 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2). Hmmm, but none of the options directly match this.

Wait, the options involve ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2.

Let me see.

The equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Let me rearrange that:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] = ln(2).

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So now, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which matches as above.

But wait, in the equation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but when I rearranged, I had 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is option D.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

We had:

(n_j1/n_i1) = 2 (n_j2/n_i2).

Each ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Substituting ΔE = k, we get:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2).

Take natural logs:

-1/T1 = ln(2) -1/T2.

Which rearranges to:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Which can be written as:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2).

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is option D.

Looking at the options, option D is "ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2)", which is what we have.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the excitation of energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_j}{n_i} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to \( k \) (since \( k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)).

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is related to their temperatures by:

\[
\frac{n_{j1}}{n_{i1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{n_{j2}}{n_{i2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{j1}}{n_{i1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{j2}}{n_{i2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into this relationship gives:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{1}{T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
