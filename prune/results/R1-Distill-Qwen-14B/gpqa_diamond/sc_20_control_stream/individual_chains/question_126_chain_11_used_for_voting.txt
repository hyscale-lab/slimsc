Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram. The options are various combinations of peaks in chiral and normal-phase HPLC.

First, I need to understand each reaction and their products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones. So, the ketone group in the starting material will be reduced. Let me draw the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure: It's a six-carbon chain. The ketone is at position 3, so the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, actually the correct structure is: the main chain is six carbons, with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5. So, the structure would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let's count the carbons.

Wait, hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No wait, wait. Wait, 5-methoxy would mean the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C(O)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached?
Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

1 2 3 4 5 6
CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Hexane is six carbons. 3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 1 2 3 4 5 6.

Wait, it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the main chain is six carbons. Position 3 is the ketone. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C(O)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: OCH3 (methoxy)
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's seven carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I should number it correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO... So maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me try writing it correctly. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Oh, wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, let me count.

The correct structure for hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's six carbons. Let me see: positions 1 to 6. So 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: C=O, 4: CH2, 5: CH2, 6: CH3? No, that's 6 carbons but the ketone is at position 3. So positions would be:

1: CH2CH2-C(O)-..., wait maybe it's better to write the full structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3-CH3. But with the methoxy on carbon 5.

So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe that's six carbons. Let me count the carbons again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the main chain is six carbons. The ketone is at position 3, and the methoxy is at position 5.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2-

Wait, but that would make the structure: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-

Wait, that's six carbons in the main chain. So the positions are 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: carbonyl, 4: CH2, 5: CH(OCH3), 6: CH2-? No, that can't be. Or perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: OCH3 attached to which carbon?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The main chain is hexane, with a ketone at position 3, and a methoxy group at position 5.

So:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3

So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, no. Because 5-methoxy is on the fifth carbon of a six-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, no, that's six carbons. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the structure isn't that important for the reaction, but more so the type of reaction.

So Reaction I: treated with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent (LiAlH4). It will reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one will become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no: the reduction of a ketone (R2CO) to R2CH2OH? No, wait, ketone reduction adds two hydrogens: R2CO â†’ R2CH2OH? Wait, no, wait. When a ketone is reduced, R2CO becomes R2CH(OH). So (R)- or (S)-configuration, depending on the starting material.

Wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives full reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but in terms of stereochemistry, since the starting ketone is chiral. Wait, in this case, the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group? Or at the carbonyl?

Wait, actually, the starting material is (S)-configured at which center? Since it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed.

So, when LAH is used to reduce the ketone, the product will be a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the alcohol would depend on the starting configuration.

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at which carbon? Because the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the chiral center is at carbon 5. So when the ketone is at C3, the structure probably is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Maybe it's better to think that the starting material's structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-R, where R is such that it's a six-carbon chain.

But perhaps that's not necessary. Let's think about the reaction. LAH will reduce the ketone (at C3) to an alcohol, adding two hydrogens.

So the product after Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, because the reduction of the ketone at C3 will add two H's, so the product would have a hydroxyl group at C3. So the structure would be:

The main chain is hexane, with an OH at C3 and a methoxy at C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's six carbons?

Wait, no, hexan-3-ol would have OH on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-... Yeah.

So the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, the next reaction: Reaction II is pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH2. It's a diketone.

Reduction with NaBH4. Wait, wait, NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce ketones as effectively as LAH, but in this case, the question says excess NaBH4 is used. Wait, but NaBH4 can reduce ketones, but in the presence of alpha hydrogens, it might not reduce as readily. Alternatively, perhaps the dione is reduced in some way.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is a cyclic diketone? No, it's a straight-chain diketone. Structure: O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no. Pentane is five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2- ?

Wait, no, carbons 2 and 4 are carbonyls. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So it's 2,4-pentanedione. The structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, wait:

Wait, pentane is five carbons. 2 and 4 positions are ketones. So:

1: CH3-

2: C=O

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH3

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, it's a diketone with two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Now, when treated with NaBH4. NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent but it's not as strong as LAH. However, in this case, the problem states that excess NaBH4 is used. So maybe it's able to reduce both ketone groups.

Wait, but NaBH4 generally can't reduce ketones in the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups or when steric hindrance is high, but in this case, the diketone is symmetric.

Wait, but each ketone is adjacent to another ketone, so maybe the reduction isn't straightforward.

Wait, when you have a diketone like 2,4-pentanedione, treatment with a strong reducing agent can lead to the formation of a diol. But wait, NaBH4 is a mild reducing agent and typically doesn't reduce ketones to alcohols under normal conditions. Wait, no, NaBH4 does reduce ketones. So in this case, perhaps each ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol?

Wait, but 2,4-pentanedione, when treated with excess NaBH4, would each ketone group (at positions 2 and 4) be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because each ketone is at 2 and 4 positions.

Wait, let's think again. 2,4-pentanedione is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, I think I got the structure wrong earlier. Let me correct that.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione: the structure is (CH3)C(O)-CH2-C(O)CH3? No, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, five carbons in a row, with ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4.

When this is reduced with NaBH4, both ketones would be reduced to secondary alcohols. So the product would be:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, but that would make a 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, in reality, when you have a diketone that's symmetric, what happens? Let me think.

Wait, the structure would then be HO-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me draw it again.

Original structure: O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

After reduction, each C=O becomes CHOH. So the product is HO-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be five carbons with two hydroxyl groups on C2 and C4.

Wait, perhaps it's 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, what's the structure of pentane-2,4-dione? It's O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. So, the central CH2 is between two ketones. So when reduced, each ketone becomes a CH(OH) group.

So the product is (CH2OH)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure would be:

HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right because the middle is CH2.

Wait, perhaps the product is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 2,3-butanediol or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the starting material is 2,4-pentane-dione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, each ketone is at C2 and C4.

After reduction, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So it would have two hydroxyl groups on C2 and C4 of a five-carbon chain. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because when reducing a diketone with NaBH4, sometimes the reduction can occur in a different way, perhaps leading to a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction would lead to a geminal diol, but that's more under different conditions. No, wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols.

So, the product of Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two secondary alcohol groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Now, the products from both reactions are combined. So let's list the products:

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a single compound with a specific stereochemistry.

From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol. This compound has two alcohol groups. Now, I need to determine if this is a single compound or a mixture.

Wait, 2,4-pentanediol is a diol with two secondary alcohols. The molecule is symmetric, so the two OH groups are on equivalent positions. So, when NaBH4 reduces the diketone, it's possible that the product is a single compound, as the molecule is symmetric. So, it's a single diastereomer or a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the molecule has two OH groups on C2 and C4 of a five-carbon chain, and the molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group, then the molecule could be a meso compound, which would make it achiral. Let me see.

The structure would be:

HOCH2-CHOH-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I think the structure would be:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

So, the molecule is symmetric. The two OH groups are on C2 and C4. So, it's a meso compound because the mirror plane bisects between the two middle carbons. Therefore, the diol is achiral, a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the diol can have stereocenters. Let's see. Each OH is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups and another carbon. Wait, in 2,4-pentanediol:

Carbon 2: connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two other groups: OH and another CH2? Or wait, let me draw it.

Wait, the structure of 2,4-pentanediol is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

So, each of the two OH-bearing carbons (C2 and C4) are connected to:

- C2: CH3, CHOH, CH2, and another CH2.

Wait, no, wait, C2: connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and has an OH group and another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps each of the OH-bearing carbons is a stereocenter. So, each has four different groups:

For C2: groups are CH3, CH2 (from C3), OH, and CH2 (from C1? Or wait, perhaps it's actually:

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each OH is on C2 and C4.

C2: attached to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- CH2 (to C3),
- OH,
- and another CH2 (from C2's own bonds? No, perhaps it's:

Actually, for C2: it's CH2OH attached to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH2). Wait, but for a carbon to be a stereocenter, it must have four different substituents.

In C2: substituents are:

- CH3,
- CH2 (from C3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen? Because the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, that's 2,3-pentanediol. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let me correct the structure. Pentane-2,4-dione has ketones on C2 and C4. So the positions are:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

When reduced, the structure becomes:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the C2 and C4 carbons now has an OH group. So each of these carbons is connected to:

C2: CH3, CH(OH), CH2, and H (wait, no, because the structure would have each of these as -CH(OH)- groups.

Wait, perhaps each of these carbons is CH(OH)CH2... Hmm, maybe each has four substituents, making them stereocenters.

But the molecule is symmetric, so the configuration of C2 and C4 would mirror each other. So, if C2 is R, C4 would be S, making the molecule a meso compound, hence achiral.

Alternatively, if both C2 and C4 are R, then the molecule would be chiral, but due to the symmetry, it's a meso compound.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. Let's say C2 has configuration R and C4 has configuration S. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then R and S configurations would mirror each other, making the molecule achiral.

So 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, hence achiral, so the product of Reaction II is a single compound.

So, the products from both reactions are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a single enantiomer.

2. 2,4-pentanediol: a single meso compound (so achiral).

Now, the products are combined. So, when they are combined, how many distinct compounds are present? Let's see.

Each reaction gives one product.

Wait, but perhaps Reaction II's product is a diol that can exist in different stereoisomers. Wait, no, because earlier I thought it's a meso compound, which is a single compound.

Wait, another possibility: when reducing a diketone with two ketones, perhaps the reduction can occur in a way that forms a geminal diol. Wait, but that would require both ketones to be on the same carbon, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a different product. Wait, perhaps the diketone is reduced to a single alcohol. But that doesn't make sense because each ketone is separate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

So, after both reactions are complete, we have two products: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So, when these are combined, we have two distinct compounds.

But wait, is 2,4-pentanediol a single compound or a mixture? As discussed, it's a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

So, the combined products are two compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I. Let me reevaluate.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH.

LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center at C5 (the methoxy is on C5, which is a chiral center because it's attached to four different groups: the rest of the chain, the methoxy, and two CH2 groups? Or is the methoxy at a position that makes it a chiral center?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the configuration is at C5.

When the ketone at C3 is reduced, that creates a new chiral center at C3, because the ketone (spÂ²) becomes an alcohol (spÂ³) with four different substituents.

Wait, yes. So, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center because it was a carbonyl group, which is planar, but upon reduction, it becomes a carbon with four different groups: the two adjacent CH2 groups, the OH group, and the rest of the chain.

So, the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with a new chiral center at C3, which would have a certain configuration.

Wait, but wait, the starting material's configuration is at C5. So after reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center.

But the question is about the products when combined and their chromatographic behavior.

So, Reaction I gives one enantiomer of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (since the starting material was (S) configuration, the product would have a specific R or S configuration at C3). Reaction II gives a meso compound (so achiral), 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but when you reduce pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, is the product a single compound (meso) or a racemic mixture?

Wait, no, because if the starting material is a symmetrical diketone, the reduction may not lead to any new chiral centers. Wait, but in this case, each ketone is at C2 and C4, so each could form a chiral center upon reduction.

Wait, but the molecule overall is symmetric. So, if one OH is R and the other is S, the molecule would be meso, making it achiral. Alternatively, if both are R or both are S, the molecule would be chiral, but because of symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is a meso compound, hence a single compound.

So, products:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a single enantiomer.

2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso): a single, achiral compound.

So, combining these, we have two products: one chiral and one achiral.

Wait, but wait, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, but is it chiral or not? It's achiral because it's a meso compound.

So, when the products are combined, how many distinct compounds do we have? Two.

But wait, let's think again about Reaction II. When pentane-2,4-dione is treated with NaBH4. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but in some cases, it can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. But how many stereoisomers are formed?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about it this way: when you have a symmetrical diketone, reducing both ketones might lead to a diol which is a meso compound. So, the product would be a single compound, which is achiral.

So, Reaction II yields one product, which is achiral.

So, the combined products are:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: chiral.

- 2,4-pentanediol: achiral.

So, when these are run on a normal-phase HPLC column, which separates compounds based on polarity, how many peaks would each product give?

Normal-phase HPLC separates by polarity, with more polar compounds eluting later. But each product is a single compound. So, each would give a single peak. So, two peaks in total on the normal-phase HPLC.

Now, when these are run on a chiral HPLC column, which is packed with a chiral stationary phase, the column can separate enantiomers. So, how many chiral compounds are present in the mixture?

We have:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: this is a single enantiomer, so it won't separate into multiple peaks because it's only one enantiomer. The chiral HPLC would not show any peak splitting because it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, no. Wait, chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. If the sample contains a single enantiomer, it will elute as one peak. If it's a racemic mixture, it would show two peaks. But in this case, the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so in chiral HPLC, it would give a single peak.

But wait, wait. Wait, if the sample contains a single enantiomer, the chiral column would not separate it into two peaks because there's only one. So, it would give a single peak.

But wait, wait another thing. The other product, 2,4-pentanediol, is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, it won't interact with the chiral stationary phase in a way that causes peak splitting. It would elute as a single peak as well.

So, in the chiral HPLC, the sample has two compounds: one chiral (single enantiomer) and one achiral. So, each would give a single peak, leading to two peaks in total on the chiral HPLC.

But wait, no. Wait, the chiral HPLC is for separating enantiomers. If a compound is present as a single enantiomer, it will give a single peak. The achiral compound may not interact as much with the chiral stationary phase, but it would still elute as a single peak.

So, in the chiral HPLC, we would see two peaks: one for the chiral alcohol and one for the achiral diol.

But wait, let's think again about the diol. 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's achiral. So, when run on a chiral HPLC, it won't be separated based on chirality, but it would be separated based on its other properties (like polarity). So, it would still appear as a single peak.

So, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for each product.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question's options don't have two peaks in both columns. Wait, the options are:

Option B: 3 chiral, 2 normal.

Option C: 4 chiral, 2 normal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a diastereomer or something else. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, which reduces the ketone to an alcohol.

The starting material has a chiral center at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So, the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: at C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, but the problem states that the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5. After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes a secondary alcohol, adding a new chiral center at C3.

So, the product is a diastereomer if the configuration at C3 is R or S.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the new OH group at C3's configuration depends on the reduction. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives the (R) configuration when reducing ketones, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent but doesn't necessarily control the stereochemistry of the reduction unless the starting material has a certain configuration.

Wait, wait, the starting ketone is (S)-configured at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, that would create a new chiral center at C3.

In the reduction of ketones, the configuration of the new alcohol can depend on the mechanism. LAH is a strong, bulky reducing agent, but I think in this case, the reduction leads to the less substituted alcohol. Wait, no, LAH typically gives the anti addition in certain reductions, but in ketone reduction, it adds two hydrogens, so the product's configuration depends on the starting material's structure.

Wait, perhaps the stereochemistry at C3 after reduction would be determined by the mechanism. For ketone reduction, the product's configuration is typically R for a planar spÂ² center. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a specific configuration based on the starting material's structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely because the starting material is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, the starting material is (S) at C5, but the reduction of C3's ketone creates a new chiral center at C3. So, the product will have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Wait, but the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to the same configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed under the assumption that Reaction I produces a single compound with two chiral centers.

So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers. So, it's a diastereomer if another configuration exists. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer.

But wait, would this compound have any stereoisomers other than itself? Let me think. The compound has two chiral centers, so it can have up to four stereoisomers (2^2 =4). But depending on the structure, some might be meso compounds.

Wait, the compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's see:

At C5: configuration S.

At C3: configuration R (assuming the reduction leads to R configuration).

Wait, but the actual configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. Since the starting material is a ketone, the reduction by LAH would give the (R) configuration at C3. So, the product is (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, considering this, the molecule has two chiral centers. So, it can have four possible stereoisomers. But in this case, it's a single enantiomer, so it's one of the four.

But wait, when combined with the other product, which is a meso compound, the total number of peaks in the HPLC would depend on how each product interacts with the columns.

Wait, but earlier I thought Reaction I's product is a single compound and Reaction II's product is a single compound, leading to two products in total.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products each reaction produces.

Wait, let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers. So, it's a single diastereomer.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ 2,4-pentanediol (meso), a single compound, which is achiral.

So, the combined products are two distinct compounds: one chiral (with two chiral centers) and one achiral.

When run on a normal-phase HPLC, each would give a single peak, so two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, the chiral compound might interact with the stationary phase, leading to separation of its diastereomers, but wait, no. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers, not diastereomers. So, if a compound has multiple chiral centers, a chiral column would separate enantiomers, but if it's a diastereomer, it might not separate.

Wait, but in this case, the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, so it won't split into multiple peaks on a chiral column. It will give a single peak. The other product is achiral, so it would also give a single peak. So, in total, two peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me look back.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C) 4 and 2

D) 3 and 3

Wait, I'm getting two peaks on both columns, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the products' analysis.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II produces a racemic mixture. Wait, no, the starting material was a diketone, and the product is a meso compound. So, only one product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is actually a diastereomer and has another stereoisomer that is present. But no, I think the product is a single diastereomer.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the products are:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol â†’ which is a single compound with a specific stereochemistry.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so single product.

So, in total, two compounds.

When run on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: two peaks (one for each compound).

But the options don't have two peaks in either. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II produces two products. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

Wait, perhaps the reduction doesn't proceed as I thought. Maybe it's not reducing both ketones, but reducing one or the other in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a geminal diol. Wait, but that would require both ketones to be on the same carbon, which they're not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce both ketones, but I think it would, given that it's a strong enough reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps I should look up what happens when 2,4-pentanedione is treated with NaBH4. Wait, according to some sources, NaBH4 can reduce diketones like 2,4-pentanedione to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

So, Reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol, a single compound.

So, back to the products: two compounds.

So, the normal-phase HPLC would have two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would have two peaks as well. So, the answer would be two peaks in each, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, none of the options have two peaks. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps each reaction produces more than one product.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, perhaps the reduction could lead to different products. No, LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it should just reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

But perhaps the product can undergo further reaction, but the problem states that the reaction is 100% complete.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a diastereomer, but that's a single compound. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about Reaction II. Maybe Reaction II's product is a diastereomer. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps when reducing 2,4-pentanedione, the product can form either a cis or trans diol. But no, that's not correct. Wait, I'm not making sense here.

Alternative approach: perhaps the products of the two reactions are more than two in number. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ treated with LAH.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reduction of a ketone typically gives a secondary alcohol. So, product is a single alcohol.

So, Reaction I gives one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ treated with NaBH4 â†’ 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single product.

So, combined products: two compounds.

But that leads to two peaks in each HPLC. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products each reaction produces.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a mixture of diastereomers, but I thought it was a meso compound, which is a single product.

Wait, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's a single product.

Let me reevaluate the initial assumption. Are the products from Reaction I and II each a single compound, leading to two products in total?

Yes. So, two peaks on each HPLC. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the product from Reaction I is such that it's a pair of enantiomers. But no, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to a single product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has a new chiral center, but the starting material's configuration affects it.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has a new chiral center at C3, but the overall molecule may have an additional chiral center elsewhere. So, it's a single diastereomer with two chiral centers.

But in that case, when run on a chiral column, would it split into more peaks? No, because it's a single compound.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction II is actually a pair of enantiomers, but no, it's a meso compound.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible number of peaks.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

If the products were:

Reaction I: 2 chiral centers â†’ single compound,

Reaction II: 0 chiral centers â†’ single compound.

So, when run on normal-phase: two peaks.

On chiral: two peaks.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers. But no, it's a single starting material.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is actually a racemic mixture. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction would produce a single enantiomer at C3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again about the products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a diol that has two stereocenters and is a meso compound. So, it's a single product. So, two products in total.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks (one for each compound).

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about Reaction II. Maybe the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers. Let me think.

Wait, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound because of the plane of symmetry. So, it's a single compound. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that each reaction produces more than one product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But, wait, could the reduction result in more than one product? For example, could it form a different diastereomer? No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction of the ketone would proceed in a specific way.

So, Reaction I produces a single product.

Reaction II produces a single product.

So, two products in total.

So, run on normal-phase and chiral columns, each would show two peaks.

But that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Another approach: perhaps the products are more than two because each reaction produces more than one product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products: the desired alcohol and something else. But I don't think so. LAH should just reduce the ketone.

Reaction II: perhaps the diketone is reduced to a diol, but also some other product is formed. But I think it's reduced completely to the diol.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the number of products but about their interaction with the HPLC columns.

Wait, normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. So, each compound would give a peak. If there are two compounds, two peaks.

Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers. So, for each chiral compound, it would split into two peaks if it's a pair of enantiomers. If the compound is achiral, it won't split.

So, in our case:

- Reaction I's product: chiral (two chiral centers), but a single enantiomer. So, on chiral HPLC, it would give one peak.

- Reaction II's product: achiral (meso), so on chiral HPLC, one peak.

So, total on chiral HPLC: two peaks.

On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but when run on a chiral column, it could split into more peaks.

Wait, but chiral columns separate enantiomers, not diastereomers. So, a single diastereomer would give one peak on a chiral column.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has multiple chiral centers, leading to multiple enantiomers.

Wait, Reaction I's product has two chiral centers. So, it can exist as four stereoisomers: two pairs of enantiomers.

But in this case, the product is a single diastereomer, so it's one enantiomer. So, on a chiral column, it would give one peak.

But if the product was a racemic mixture, it would give two peaks.

So, perhaps I missed that the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. But if the reduction is stereospecific, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product has two chiral centers, leading to four stereoisomers. But the product is a single diastereomer, so it would give one peak on the chiral HPLC.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, so total two on normal-phase, two on chiral.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should think that Reaction I produces two products. For example, perhaps the product is a diastereomer that exists as a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound.

So, when run on normal-phase, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the chiral product would give one peak, and the meso product would give another, so two peaks.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, leading to a single peak on both HPLCs.

Wait, that would give three peaks on the chiral HPLC (two from Reaction I, one from II) and two on the normal-phase.

Looking at the options, option B is 3 and 2.

So, let's see:

If Reaction I produces two enantiomers, then on chiral HPLC, it would split into two peaks. Reaction II's product, being meso, would give one peak. So, total three peaks on chiral HPLC.

On normal-phase, each product gives a single peak, so two peaks.

So, the answer would be option B: 3 and 2.

But why would Reaction I produce two enantiomers? Because the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, leading to one peak on the chiral HPLC.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers. But on a chiral column, it would interact based on its own configuration. So, if it's a single enantiomer, it would give one peak. The diol would give another.

So, two peaks on chiral, two on normal.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer that also exists as a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but no. The product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, so one peak on the chiral HPLC.

I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

Looking at the options, option C says 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal.

How could that happen?

If Reaction I's product is a diastereomer that can form four stereoisomers, but that's not possible as it would require two chiral centers leading to four isomers. But the product is a single diastereomer, so only one.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound. So, on chiral HPLC, Reaction I gives two peaks, Reaction II gives one. Total of three.

On normal, two peaks.

But none of the options have three and two.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should be a single product.

Wait, unless the reduction leads to racemization, but I don't think so. LAH is a strong reducing agent, but I don't think it causes racemization in this case.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me think about the possible answers based on the options.

The options are:

A)5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

If the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal.

How could that happen?

Perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer that can form two enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which gives another peak. So, 3.

But earlier analysis suggests Reaction I's product is a single compound, leading to one peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has another chiral center, leading to multiple peaks.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, but when run on chiral HPLC, it interacts in a way that splits into multiple peaks. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the products of the reactions.

Wait, let me reevaluate the reactions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So, two products.

When run on normal-phase: two peaks.

On chiral: two peaks.

But options don't have that.

Unless I'm wrong about Reaction II's product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a racemic mixture, not a meso compound. But that can't be because the starting material is symmetrical, so the product would be a meso compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. But in that case, it would have two chiral centers and be a chiral compound, not meso.

Wait, no. If the product is a meso compound, it's achiral. So, on chiral HPLC, it would not split into peaks.

So, Reaction II's product gives one peak on both HPLC columns.

Reaction I's product gives one peak on both HPLC columns.

So, total peaks: two on each column.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B: 3 and 2.

But I can't figure out why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products in Reaction II.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound but two enantiomers. So, for Reaction II, the product is two enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC.

So, Reaction I: one product, Reaction II: two products (enantiomers).

So, on normal-phase: three products â†’ three peaks.

On chiral HPLC: Reaction I's product (one peak) and Reaction II's (two peaks), totaling three.

But that would give three on chiral and three on normal, which is option D.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction II's product is a meso compound, leading to one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral.

Reaction I's product: one peak on each.

So, two peaks on normal and two on chiral.

Not matching any options.

I think I'm stuck. Let me proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist, followed by analyzing the products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (lithium aluminum hydride), a strong reducing agent.
- **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, forming (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- **Product**: A single compound with two chiral centers (C3 and C5). The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product is also a single enantiomer.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetric diketone).
- **Reagent**: Excess NaBH4, a reducing agent.
- **Reaction**: Both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
- **Product**: A meso compound, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. This results in a single product.

### Combined Products:
1. **From Reaction I**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a single chiral compound with two chiral centers).
2. **From Reaction II**: 2,4-pentanediol (a single achiral compound, meso).

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: Separates compounds based on polarity. Since there are two distinct compounds (one chiral and one achiral), **two peaks** are observed.
2. **Chiral HPLC**: Separates enantiomers. 
   - The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it gives **one peak**.
   - The product from Reaction II is achiral (meso compound), so it gives **one peak**.
   - Total: **two peaks** on the chiral HPLC.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5 and 4)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not match the analysis.
- **Option B (3 and 2)**: Incorrect. The analysis predicts two peaks on both columns, not three on the chiral HPLC.
- **Option C (4 and 2)**: Incorrect. The analysis predicts two peaks on both columns, not four on the chiral HPLC.
- **Option D (3 and 3)**: Incorrect. The analysis predicts two peaks on both columns, not three on either.

### Conclusion:
The analysis predicts **two peaks** on both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning, the closest match to the intended answer is **Option B (3 and 2)**, though this does not align perfectly with the analysis.

ANSWER: B
