Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Maybe if I break it down, I can figure it out.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is tau_0 = 8×10^-16 seconds. They're asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that particle lifetimes and decay lengths are important in detectors. The lifetime is the proper time, which is the time measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime we observe is longer due to time dilation. So I think I'll need to calculate the Lorentz gamma factor here.

The formula for the decay length is L = gamma * v * tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but I don't know the velocity directly. Oh wait, I can find gamma using the energy and mass. Because the total energy E is gamma * m*c². Oh, but wait, the energy given is in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV. So maybe I can just compute gamma as E/(m c²) but considering the units? Hmm, not sure about the units here, but I think in particle physics, sometimes they just use E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, I have to be careful with units. Since both E and m are given in GeV, and c is a constant, perhaps the calculation is E/(m) gives gamma? Let me think.

Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But when E and m are in the same units (GeV), I can ignore the c² because E and m c² would have the same units if m is in GeV/c². Hmm, I might be getting myself confused. Let me check: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and mass m in GeV/c². So E (GeV) equals gamma m c² (GeV). So gamma = E/(m c²). But if E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then substituting units: GeV / ( (GeV/c²) * c² ) ) = GeV / GeV = unitless, which makes sense for gamma. So, gamma would be E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.918.

Wait, but maybe I should compute that exactly. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me calculate that. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*7.9 is about 27. So 7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

Hmm, then I need the velocity. Velocity v is beta * c, where beta is v/c. So beta can be found using gamma. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So I can solve for beta.

Let me rearrange that equation: 1/gamma^2 = 1 - beta^2. So beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2) → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So with gamma around 7.92, 1/gamma^2 is about 1/(62.72) ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is about 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992, so v is about 0.992c.

So now I can calculate the decay length. Decay length L is gamma * v * tau_0. Wait, but tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

Wait, no. Decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau_0. So L = v * gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, substituting v = beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but beta = v/c, so substituting that, L = (v/c) * c * gamma tau_0 = v gamma tau_0. Alternatively, since v = beta c, L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The lifetime observed is t = gamma tau_0. The distance is v * t, which is beta c * gamma tau_0. So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So putting numbers in:

beta is about 0.992, gamma is 7.92, c is approximately 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.992 * 7.92 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *7.92: approximately 7.86.

Then multiply by 3e8: 7.86 *3e8 = 2.358e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.358e9 * 8e-16 = 2.358 *8 * 1e-7 → 18.864e-7 m = 1.8864e-6 meters.

Wait, that's 1.8864e-6 meters, which is approximately 1.89e-6 m.

But wait, the problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so what's the relation between the decay length and the resolution?

I think the idea is that the detector has a certain resolution, and if the decay length is longer than the resolution, you can't see the decay because the tracks are too close together. Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution needs to be such that it can distinguish a certain number of decay points along the path. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about detection efficiency. The decay length determines how far the decay products travel from the original point. If the particle decays, and the decay products (like Y and Z) leave tracks in the bubble chamber. So the longer the decay length, the more spread out the tracks, making it easier to detect that a decay occurred. But the resolution of the detector dictates how precisely it can measure the positions.

Wait, no. The resolution is the smallest distance the detector can distinguish between two points. So to observe a decay, the decay length should be larger than the detector's resolution. Otherwise, the tracks from the decay products Y and Z would be too close to the original point, making it hard to see that a decay happened. But wait, the problem is about observing at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we need to find the decay length such that 30% of the decays have a length larger than a certain value, which the detector can resolve.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the question is about the minimum resolution required so that the detector can see the decay. If the decay length is too small, you can't resolve the decay products from the original track. So you need a resolution (Δ) such that the decay length L is greater than Δ, which allows you to detect it.

But the question says, what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's about the probability that the decay length is larger than the detector's resolution. So we need to find the value of the detector's resolution (Δ) such that 30% of the decays have L > Δ. That would mean that the detector can observe 30% of them.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the detector's resolution determines the minimum distance it can measure. So to see any decay, the decay must have a length longer than the resolution. But the problem says "at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps we're looking for the shortest possible decay length that allows 30% of the decays to be observed.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the decay process and the decay length distribution. The decay length is a function of the particle's lifetime and velocity, which are determined by gamma and beta. But each decay occurs at a random time, so the decay length would follow an exponential distribution or something similar.

Wait, no, the decay process is a Poisson process, and the probability that a particle decays within a certain time (or distance) is given by 1 - exp(-t/(tau)). But perhaps in this case, we can model the decay length as a function of the proper lifetime and the velocity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, but the average decay length would give me the most probable value, but I'm not sure about the distribution. For an exponential distribution, the probability that the decay occurs after a certain time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)), so the probability that the decay length is greater than L is exp(-L/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

Wait, but the problem is about the detector's resolution. Suppose the detector can only resolve decays where the decay length is greater than some minimum value, say delta. So the probability P(L > delta) = 0.3 (30%). So I need to find delta such that P(L > delta) = 0.3.

Hmm, the decay length L is a random variable. Since the decay occurs at a random time, the decay length distribution is exponential. So the probability that L is greater than delta is exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

So I can set exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)) ) = 0.7, because 30% of the decays have L > delta, meaning 70% are below. Wait, no. Wait, P(L > delta) = 30%, so 0.3 = exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

Wait, solving for delta: -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0) = ln(0.3) → delta = - beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.3).

Wait, let me compute that. ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397.

So delta = beta gamma c tau_0 * 1.20397.

So let me plug in the numbers again. Beta is about 0.992, gamma is 7.92, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So beta gamma = 0.992 *7.92 ≈ 7.86.

So delta = 7.86 * 3e8 * 8e-16 * 1.20397.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 7.86 *3e8 = 2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16 = 1.8864e-6.

1.8864e-6 * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

Wait, 2.27e-6 m is 2.27 micrometers.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. So that's close to what I just got, but not exactly the same.

But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more precisely.

Let me re-calculate beta and gamma more accurately.

Gamma is E/m. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 /3.41 = let's compute that.

3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 *7.9 = 3.41*(7 +0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939. That's very close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Wait, 3.41 *7.918 ≈ 3.41 *7.9 = 26.939. So 7.918 is just a bit more than 7.9.

So beta = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.918)^2).

Calculating gamma^2: 7.918^2 = approx 62.7.

So 1/(62.7) ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. Square root of that is sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992 (since 0.992^2 is 0.984064), which matches.

So beta is 0.992.

So now, delta = beta * gamma * c * tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Wait, no, earlier I had delta = beta gamma c tau_0 * (ln(1/0.3)) because the equation was:

P(L>delta) = 0.3 → exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)) =0.3 → delta= (beta gamma c tau_0 ) * ln(1/0.3) = beta gamma c tau_0 * ln(10/3) ≈ ln(3.333) ≈ 1.20397.

So using exact numbers: beta=0.992, gamma=7.918.

So beta * gamma = 0.992 *7.918 ≈ 7.86.

Then, 7.86 * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

So 7.86 * 2.4e-7 = 1.8864e-6 m.

Multiply by ln(10/3)=1.20397: 1.8864e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

But the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Hmmm, so perhaps my approach has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the average lifetime or something else.

Wait, another approach: The number of decays observed depends on the decay probability within a certain time. But perhaps I should think about the average decay length.

Wait, the average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. Let me compute that.

beta=0.992, gamma=7.918, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg = 0.992 *7.918 *3e8 *8e-16.

Calculating step by step:

0.992 *7.918 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8= 2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16 = 1.8864e-6 m.

So average decay length is about 1.88e-6 m.

But the problem is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution (Δ) must be less than the average decay length multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the proper way is to calculate the minimum possible L such that 30% of the decays are observed. Since the decay is exponential, the probability that a decay occurs after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But perhaps the number of decays observed is the fraction of decays where the decay length is larger than the resolution. So the minimum resolution (Δ) would be the length such that 30% of the decays have L > Δ.

So the probability P(L > Δ) = 30% = 0.3. Since L is distributed exponentially, P(L > Δ) = exp(-Δ/(beta gamma c tau_0)) = 0.3.

So solving for Δ: Δ = - beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.3).

Wait, ln(0.3) is about -1.20397, so:

Δ = beta gamma c tau_0 * 1.20397.

Plugging in the numbers again:

beta gamma =0.992 *7.918 ≈7.86.

c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

So beta gamma c tau_0 =7.86 *2.4e-7 ≈ 1.8864e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.8864e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers.

But the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma or beta.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV.

27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87. 27-23.87=3.13 left.

3.13 /3.41 = approx 0.917. So gamma is 7.917.

Hmm, perhaps more accurately 7.917.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.917)^2)).

7.917^2 = approx (7.9^2)=62.41, but more accurately:

7.917 *7.917 = let's compute:

7.917 ×7.917:

= (7 + 0.917)^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*0.917 + 0.917^2.

=49 + 12.838 + 0.840889 = approx 49 +12.838=61.838 +0.840889=62.67889.

So 1/(7.917^2) ≈1/62.67889 ≈0.015945.

So 1 - 0.015945=0.984055. Square root of that is sqrt(0.984055) ≈0.9920.

So beta is 0.9920.

So beta*gamma =0.9920 *7.917 = let's compute:

0.9920 *7 =6.944, 0.9920 *0.917 ≈0.910.

So 6.944 +0.910=7.854.

So more accurately, beta*gamma=7.854.

So now, delta =7.854 * c * tau_0 * 1.20397.

c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7 = 1.88496e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397:

1.88496e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m.

Hmm, same result.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.92 times my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is not the length where 30% of decays are observed, but the length such that the detector can resolve the decay, i.e., the decay length must be larger than the resolution. So the minimum resolution is such that L > delta. So 30% of the decays have L > delta. So delta is the 70th percentile of the decay length distribution.

Wait, no, because the problem says "at least 30%", so perhaps we're looking for the value where 30% of decays have L >= delta. So 30% is the fraction that can be observed. So to find the minimal delta such that 30% of the decays have L >= delta.

So the correct approach would be to find delta such that P(L >= delta) =0.3 → P(L < delta) =0.7.

Since L follows an exponential distribution, the CDF is P(L < delta) =1 -exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

So 1 -exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0))=0.7 → exp( -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0) )=0.3 → -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0) = ln(0.3) → delta = - beta gamma c tau_0 * ln(0.3).

Which is what I did earlier, so delta is approximately 2.27e-6 m. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the calculation of beta*gamma.

Wait, let me compute 7.917 *0.992 exactly.

7.917 *0.992:

Let me compute 7.917 * (1 -0.008) =7.917 - (7.917 *0.008).

7.917 *0.008 =0.063336.

So 7.917 -0.063336=7.853664.

So beta*gamma=7.853664.

Now, delta = 7.853664 * c * tau_0 * (-ln(0.3)).

c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m.

So 7.853664 *24e-8 =7.853664 *2.4e-7= approx 1.885e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.885e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy? Oh wait, that's a possibility. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy E_total is K + m c². That would change the calculation of gamma.

Wait, in high-energy physics, when they give the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy. But sometimes it's the kinetic energy. Did the question specify? Let me check.

The question says: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV." It doesn't specify, but in particle physics, E usually includes rest mass. So E = gamma m c².

But if E were kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c². So gamma = (E_kinetic)/(m c²) +1.

So if the given E is 27 GeV, and it's kinetic energy, then:

gamma = (27)/(3.41) +1 ≈7.918 +1=8.918.

Which would change beta and all the subsequent calculations.

That's a possibility. Let me try that.

So if E is kinetic:

gamma = (27/3.41) +1 ≈7.918 +1=8.918.

Beta would then be sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (8.918)^2 ≈79.53.

1/(79.53)=0.01256.

So 1 -0.01256=0.98744. sqrt(0.98744)=approx 0.9937.

So beta≈0.9937.

So beta*gamma=0.9937 *8.918≈8.844.

Then, delta= beta gamma c tau_0 * ln(10/3).

c tau_0=24e-8 m.

So delta=8.844 *24e-8 *1.20397.

Compute 8.844 *24e-8: 8.844 *24= 212.256 → 212.256e-8 =2.12256e-6 m.

Then multiply by 1.20397: 2.12256e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.558e-6 m, which is about 2.56e-6 m.

That's even further from the options.

Hmm, but the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the initial approach was correct, and perhaps the calculation should be done more accurately.

Let me compute gamma =27/3.41 exactly.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13 left.

3.13 ÷3.41 → let's compute 3.41 *0.917=3.12557, which is about 3.13. So 27/3.41=7.9179.

gamma=7.9179.

Then, beta= sqrt(1-1/(7.9179^2)).

Compute 7.9179 squared: 7.9179 *7.9179.

Let me compute it accurately.

7 *7 =49.

7 *0.9179=6.4253.

0.9179 *7=6.4253.

0.9179 *0.9179 ≈0.8425.

So,

(7 +0.9179)^2 =7^2 + 2*7*0.9179 +0.9179^2=49 +12.8506 +0.8425 ≈62.7.

Wait, precise calculation:

7.9179 ×7.9179:

= (7.9 +0.0179)^2.

=7.9^2 + 2*7.9 *0.0179 +0.0179^2.

=62.41 + 0.27518 +0.00032041≈62.6855.

So 1/gamma²=1/62.6855≈0.01595.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920 (since 0.992^2=0.984064).

So beta=0.9920.

So beta*gamma=0.9920 *7.9179= 0.9920 *7=6.944, 0.9920 *0.9179=0.910.

So total is 7.854.

So beta gamma=7.854.

So delta=7.854 * c tau_0 * (-ln(0.3)).

c tau_0=3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7 =7.854 *2.4 =18.8496 → 18.8496e-7=1.88496e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.88496e-6 *1.20397=2.268e-6 m.

So approximately 2.27e-6 m.

But the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.917 times this value.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to use the mean lifetime, not the proper lifetime. Wait, no, because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is the mean lifetime in the rest frame.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the minimum value that the detector can resolve. So if the decay length is smaller than the resolution, you can't see it. But the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So if the detector has a resolution (Δ) such that 30% of the decays have decay lengths longer than Δ, then Δ is the minimum resolution needed.

But the calculation gives delta=2.27e-6 m, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 27/3.41 exactly.

3.41 ×7.917=27?

Let me do 3.41 ×7.917.

First, 3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×0.917: let's compute 3.41 *0.9=3.069; 3.41*0.017=0.05797. So total 3.069+0.05797=3.12697.

So 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697≈27. So 27/3.41=7.917.

So beta*gamma=0.9920 *7.917=7.854.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the exact value of delta.

delta = beta gamma c tau_0 * (-ln(0.3)).

Plugging the values:

beta gamma c tau_0 =7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7= 7.854 *2.4=18.8496 → 18.8496e-7=1.88496e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.88496e-6 *1.20397.

Let me compute this accurately.

1.88496e-6 *1.20397 = (1.88496 *1.20397) *1e-6.

Compute 1.88496 ×1.20397.

1.88496 ×1.2 = 2.261952.

1.88496 ×0.00397≈approx 0.007436.

So total ≈2.261952 +0.007436=2.269388.

So 2.269388e-6 m ≈2.269e-6 m.

Hmm, so 2.269e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Wait, perhaps the correct value is 2.08e-6 m, which is option A. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check where.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should use the average decay length, not the value for 30%. Because the average decay length is around 1.88e-6 m. So perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, but that's not what the question says.

The question says minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the answer is about the 70th percentile of the decay length distribution, which is at 30% of the events. But my calculation gives 2.27e-6 m, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is simpler. Let's compute the decay length and then see if it matches any option.

Compute L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So, L =0.992 *7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step:

0.992 *7.917 ≈7.854.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7 =1.88496e-6 m=1.885e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 m=1.885 micrometers.

The average decay length is about 1.885 micrometers. So the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution must be less than the average decay length so that 30% of the events are observed. Wait no, the average is the mean, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the average decay length. But option A is 2.08e-6 m=2.08 micrometers. Which is bigger than 1.885 micrometers. So if the detector's resolution is 2.08 micrometers, the decay length must be larger than that, which would happen in only a fraction of the cases.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the thinking. If the detector can resolve down to delta, then the fraction of decays observed is P(L>delta). We need this to be at least 30%.

So, as before, delta=beta gamma c tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Because P(L>delta)=0.3 → 1 - exp(-delta/(L_avg))=0.3 → exp(-delta/L_avg)=0.7 → delta= L_avg * ln(1/0.7)= L_avg * 0.35667.

Because ln(1/0.7)= ln(1.4286)=approx 0.35667.

So L_avg is beta gamma c tau_0=1.885e-6 m.

So delta=1.885e-6 *0.35667≈6.7e-7 m=670 nm, which is 0.67e-6 m. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance that the detector can resolve, which is the resolution, and that the decay length must be longer than that to be observed. So the minimum resolution would be the maximum of the decay length. But that doesn't make sense because higher energies would lead to longer decay lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the decay length itself, and that is the resolution needed. But that would be the average decay length, which is about 1.88e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 1.1 times 1.88e-6 m. So maybe I'm missing a factor of sqrt(2) or something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would be the decay length corresponding to 30% of the events. So using the exponential distribution, 30% corresponds to delta = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L_avg * ln(1/0.7)= L_avg *0.3567.

Wait, 1.885e-6 m *0.3567≈0.67e-6 m=670 nm. But that's not any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution such that the detector can resolve at least 30% of the decays. So the minimum resolution is the value where 70% of decays are below and 30% are above. So the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations I've done lead me to approximately 2.27e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the decay length as L = beta gamma c tau_0, and that is the resolution needed. So L=1.885e-6 m, which would be about 1.88 micrometers. Since the options don't have that, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, perhaps it's a miscalculation in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute beta and gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma=27/3.41.

3.41 *7.917=27. So gamma=7.917.

Compute beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

gamma²=7.917^2=62.685.

1/gamma²=0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

So beta*gamma=7.917 *0.9920=7.854.

So L = beta*gamma*c*tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L =7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

7.854 *2.4e-7 =1.88496e-6 m.

Which is 1.885e-6 m.

But the option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using relativistic mass or something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution as the average decay length multiplied by 0.7, but that would give 1.32e-6 m, which isn't an option either.

Hmm. I think I've done the calculations correctly. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. But my calculation gives 1.885e-6 m, which is about 89% of option A's value.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach uses the velocity v = c instead of beta c. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because then L would be c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, let me try that. If I mistakenly take v=c, which would be incorrect, but just to see:

L=gamma *c * tau_0.

Gamma=7.917, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.917 *3e8=2.375e9.

2.375e9 *8e-16=1.9e-6 m.

Oh wait, that gives 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

So perhaps I made a mistake in considering beta. Maybe the question assumes that the velocity is approximately c, so beta is taken as 1.

So L=gamma *c * tau_0.

Gamma=7.917.

So L=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16=7.917 *24e-8=1.9e-6 m.

Which is 1.9 micrometers.

Hmm, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher than 1.9e-6 m. But perhaps with more precise gamma and beta calculations, it would be closer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects you to take v=c, which isn't correct, but that would get you to 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects you to calculate the average decay length as L=gamma c tau_0, without considering beta.

But that's not correct because beta is less than 1, so L= beta gamma c tau_0 < gamma c tau_0.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But given the options, the closest is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Another possibility: Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, let me compute delta again with the exact formula.

delta= beta gamma c tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Because P(L>delta)=0.3 → 1-exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0))=0.3 → exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0))=0.7 → -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)=ln(0.7) → delta= (beta gamma c tau_0) * ln(1/0.7).

ln(1/0.7)= ln(1.42857)= approx 0.35667.

So delta= (7.854) * (3e8 m/s *8e-16 s) *0.35667.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

7.854 *2.4e-7=1.88496e-6 m.

1.88496e-6 *0.35667=6.7e-7 m=0.67e-6 m.

That's 0.67 micrometers, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. I think I'll have to go with the calculated average decay length, which is around 1.88e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process of the particle \( X^0 \) with a proper lifetime \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \). The energy of the particle is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The decay length \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light, \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Since \( E \) and \( m c^2 \) are both in GeV, the units simplify, and \( \gamma \) is approximately:

\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relationship between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 7.917 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.917)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.992 \), \( \gamma \approx 7.917 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.992 \cdot 7.917 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 24 \times 10^{-8} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Now calculate \( \beta \gamma c \tau_0 \):

\[
L = 0.992 \cdot 7.917 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the average decay length is approximately \( 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 4: Determine the minimum resolution
The problem asks for the minimum resolution \( \Delta \) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The decay length distribution follows an exponential probability distribution, and the resolution \( \Delta \) must satisfy:

\[
P(L > \Delta) = 0.3
\]

For an exponential distribution, \( P(L > \Delta) = \exp(-\Delta / L_{\text{avg}}) \), where \( L_{\text{avg}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 \). Solving for \( \Delta \):

\[
\Delta = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3)
\]

Substituting \( L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) and \( \ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397 \):

\[
\Delta = 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 1.20397 \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution \( \Delta \approx 2.27 \, \mu\text{m} \) is closest to option **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is the best match among the given options.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Maybe if I break it down, I can figure it out.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is tau_0 = 8×10^-16 seconds. They're asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that particle lifetimes and decay lengths are important in detectors. The lifetime is the proper time, which is the time measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime we observe is longer due to time dilation. So I think I'll need to calculate the Lorentz gamma factor here.

The formula for the decay length is L = gamma * v * tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but I don't know the velocity directly. Oh wait, I can find gamma using the energy and mass. Because the total energy E is gamma * m*c². Oh, but wait, the energy given is in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV. So maybe I can just compute gamma as E/(m c²) but considering the units? Hmm, not sure about the units here, but I think in particle physics, sometimes they just use E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, I have to be careful with units. Since both E and m are given in GeV, and c is a constant, perhaps the calculation is E/(m) gives gamma? Let me think.

Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But when E and m are in the same units (GeV), I can ignore the c² because E and m c² would have the same units if m is in GeV/c². Hmm, I might be getting myself confused. Let me check: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and mass m in GeV/c². So E (GeV) equals gamma m c² (GeV). So gamma = E/(m c²). But if E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then substituting units: GeV / ( (GeV/c²) * c² ) ) = GeV / GeV = unitless, which makes sense for gamma. So, gamma would be E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.918.

Wait, but maybe I should compute that exactly. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me calculate that. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*7.9 is about 27. So 7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

Hmm, then I need the velocity. Velocity v is beta * c, where beta is v/c. So beta can be found using gamma. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So I can solve for beta.

Let me rearrange that equation: 1/gamma^2 = 1 - beta^2. So beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2) → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So with gamma around 7.92, 1/gamma^2 is about 1/(62.72) ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is about 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992, so v is about 0.992c.

So now I can calculate the decay length. Decay length L is gamma * v * tau_0. Wait, but tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

Wait, no. Decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau_0. So L = v * gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, substituting v = beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but beta = v/c, so substituting that, L = (v/c) * c * gamma tau_0 = v gamma tau_0. Alternatively, since v = beta c, L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The lifetime observed is t = gamma tau_0. The distance is v * t, which is beta c * gamma tau_0. So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So putting numbers in:

beta is about 0.992, gamma is 7.92, c is approximately 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.992 * 7.92 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *7.92: approximately 7.86.

Then multiply by 3e8: 7.86 *3e8 = 2.358e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.358e9 * 8e-16 = 2.358 *8 * 1e-7 → 18.864e-7 m = 1.8864e-6 meters.

Wait, that's 1.8864e-6 meters, which is approximately 1.89e-6 m.

But wait, the problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so what's the relation between the decay length and the resolution?

I think the idea is that the detector has a certain resolution, and if the decay length is longer than the resolution, you can't see the decay because the tracks are too close together. Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution needs to be such that it can distinguish a certain number of decay points along the path. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about detection efficiency. The decay length determines how far the decay products travel from the original point. If the particle decays, and the decay products (like Y and Z) leave tracks in the bubble chamber. So the longer the decay length, the more spread out the tracks, making it easier to detect that a decay occurred. But the resolution of the detector dictates how precisely it can measure the positions.

Wait, no. The resolution is the smallest distance the detector can distinguish between two points. So to observe a decay, the decay length should be larger than the detector's resolution. Otherwise, the tracks from the decay products Y and Z would be too close to the original point, making it hard to see that a decay happened. But wait, the problem is about observing at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we need to find the decay length such that 30% of the decays have a length larger than a certain value, which the detector can resolve.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the question is about the minimum resolution required so that the detector can see the decay. If the decay length is too small, you can't resolve the decay products from the original track. So you need a resolution (Δ) such that the decay length L is greater than Δ, which allows you to detect it.

But the question says, what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's about the probability that the decay length is larger than the detector's resolution. So we need to find the value of the detector's resolution (Δ) such that 30% of the decays have L > Δ. That would mean that the detector can observe 30% of them.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the detector's resolution determines the minimum distance it can measure. So to see any decay, the decay must have a length longer than the resolution. But the problem says "at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps we're looking for the shortest possible decay length that allows 30% of the decays to be observed.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the decay process and the decay length distribution. The decay length is a function of the particle's lifetime and velocity, which are determined by gamma and beta. But each decay occurs at a random time, so the decay length would follow an exponential distribution or something similar.

Wait, no, the decay process is a Poisson process, and the probability that a particle decays within a certain time (or distance) is given by 1 - exp(-t/(tau)). But perhaps in this case, we can model the decay length as a function of the proper lifetime and the velocity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, but the average decay length would give me the most probable value, but I'm not sure about the distribution. For an exponential distribution, the probability that the decay occurs after a certain time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)), so the probability that the decay length is greater than L is exp(-L/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

Wait, but the problem is about the detector's resolution. Suppose the detector can only resolve decays where the decay length is greater than some minimum value, say delta. So the probability P(L > delta) = 0.3 (30%). So I need to find delta such that P(L > delta) = 0.3.

Hmm, the decay length L is a random variable. Since the decay occurs at a random time, the decay length distribution is exponential. So the probability that L is greater than delta is exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

So I can set exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)) ) = 0.7, because 30% of the decays have L > delta, meaning 70% are below. Wait, no. Wait, P(L > delta) = 30%, so 0.3 = exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

Wait, solving for delta: -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0) = ln(0.3) → delta = - beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.3).

Wait, let me compute that. ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397.

So delta = beta gamma c tau_0 * 1.20397.

So let me plug in the numbers again. Beta is about 0.992, gamma is 7.92, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So beta gamma = 0.992 *7.92 ≈ 7.86.

So delta = 7.86 * 3e8 * 8e-16 * 1.20397.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 7.86 *3e8 = 2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16 = 1.8864e-6.

1.8864e-6 * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

Wait, 2.27e-6 m is 2.27 micrometers.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. So that's close to what I just got, but not exactly the same.

But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more precisely.

Let me re-calculate beta and gamma more accurately.

Gamma is E/m. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 /3.41 = let's compute that.

3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 *7.9 = 3.41*(7 +0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939. That's very close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Wait, 3.41 *7.918 ≈ 3.41 *7.9 = 26.939. So 7.918 is just a bit more than 7.9.

So beta = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.918)^2).

Calculating gamma^2: 7.918^2 = approx 62.7.

So 1/(62.7) ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. Square root of that is sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992 (since 0.992^2 is 0.984064), which matches.

So beta is 0.992.

So now, delta = beta * gamma * c * tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Wait, no, earlier I had delta = beta gamma c tau_0 * (ln(1/0.3)) because the equation was:

P(L>delta) = 0.3 → exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)) =0.3 → delta= (beta gamma c tau_0 ) * ln(1/0.3) = beta gamma c tau_0 * ln(10/3) ≈ ln(3.333) ≈ 1.20397.

So using exact numbers: beta=0.992, gamma=7.918.

So beta * gamma = 0.992 *7.918 ≈ 7.86.

Then, 7.86 * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

So 7.86 * 2.4e-7 = 1.8864e-6 m.

Multiply by ln(10/3)=1.20397: 1.8864e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

But the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Hmmm, so perhaps my approach has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the average lifetime or something else.

Wait, another approach: The number of decays observed depends on the decay probability within a certain time. But perhaps I should think about the average decay length.

Wait, the average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. Let me compute that.

beta=0.992, gamma=7.918, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg = 0.992 *7.918 *3e8 *8e-16.

Calculating step by step:

0.992 *7.918 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8= 2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16 = 1.8864e-6 m.

So average decay length is about 1.88e-6 m.

But the problem is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution (Δ) must be less than the average decay length multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the proper way is to calculate the minimum possible L such that 30% of the decays are observed. Since the decay is exponential, the probability that a decay occurs after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But perhaps the number of decays observed is the fraction of decays where the decay length is larger than the resolution. So the minimum resolution (Δ) would be the length such that 30% of the decays have L > Δ.

So the probability P(L > Δ) = 30% = 0.3. Since L is distributed exponentially, P(L > Δ) = exp(-Δ/(beta gamma c tau_0)) = 0.3.

So solving for Δ: Δ = - beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.3).

Wait, ln(0.3) is about -1.20397, so:

Δ = beta gamma c tau_0 * 1.20397.

Plugging in the numbers again:

beta gamma =0.992 *7.918 ≈7.86.

c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

So beta gamma c tau_0 =7.86 *2.4e-7 ≈ 1.8864e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.8864e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers.

But the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma or beta.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV.

27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87. 27-23.87=3.13 left.

3.13 /3.41 = approx 0.917. So gamma is 7.917.

Hmm, perhaps more accurately 7.917.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.917)^2)).

7.917^2 = approx (7.9^2)=62.41, but more accurately:

7.917 *7.917 = let's compute:

7.917 ×7.917:

= (7 + 0.917)^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*0.917 + 0.917^2.

=49 + 12.838 + 0.840889 = approx 49 +12.838=61.838 +0.840889=62.67889.

So 1/(7.917^2) ≈1/62.67889 ≈0.015945.

So 1 - 0.015945=0.984055. Square root of that is sqrt(0.984055) ≈0.9920.

So beta is 0.9920.

So beta*gamma =0.9920 *7.917 = let's compute:

0.9920 *7 =6.944, 0.9920 *0.917 ≈0.910.

So 6.944 +0.910=7.854.

So more accurately, beta*gamma=7.854.

So now, delta =7.854 * c * tau_0 * 1.20397.

c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7 = 1.88496e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397:

1.88496e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m.

Hmm, same result.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.92 times my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is not the length where 30% of decays are observed, but the length such that the detector can resolve the decay, i.e., the decay length must be larger than the resolution. So the minimum resolution is such that L > delta. So 30% of the decays have L > delta. So delta is the 70th percentile of the decay length distribution.

Wait, no, because the problem says "at least 30%", so perhaps we're looking for the value where 30% of decays have L >= delta. So 30% is the fraction that can be observed. So to find the minimal delta such that 30% of the decays have L >= delta.

So the correct approach would be to find delta such that P(L >= delta) =0.3 → P(L < delta) =0.7.

Since L follows an exponential distribution, the CDF is P(L < delta) =1 -exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)).

So 1 -exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0))=0.7 → exp( -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0) )=0.3 → -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0) = ln(0.3) → delta = - beta gamma c tau_0 * ln(0.3).

Which is what I did earlier, so delta is approximately 2.27e-6 m. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the calculation of beta*gamma.

Wait, let me compute 7.917 *0.992 exactly.

7.917 *0.992:

Let me compute 7.917 * (1 -0.008) =7.917 - (7.917 *0.008).

7.917 *0.008 =0.063336.

So 7.917 -0.063336=7.853664.

So beta*gamma=7.853664.

Now, delta = 7.853664 * c * tau_0 * (-ln(0.3)).

c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m.

So 7.853664 *24e-8 =7.853664 *2.4e-7= approx 1.885e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.885e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy? Oh wait, that's a possibility. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy E_total is K + m c². That would change the calculation of gamma.

Wait, in high-energy physics, when they give the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy. But sometimes it's the kinetic energy. Did the question specify? Let me check.

The question says: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV." It doesn't specify, but in particle physics, E usually includes rest mass. So E = gamma m c².

But if E were kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c². So gamma = (E_kinetic)/(m c²) +1.

So if the given E is 27 GeV, and it's kinetic energy, then:

gamma = (27)/(3.41) +1 ≈7.918 +1=8.918.

Which would change beta and all the subsequent calculations.

That's a possibility. Let me try that.

So if E is kinetic:

gamma = (27/3.41) +1 ≈7.918 +1=8.918.

Beta would then be sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (8.918)^2 ≈79.53.

1/(79.53)=0.01256.

So 1 -0.01256=0.98744. sqrt(0.98744)=approx 0.9937.

So beta≈0.9937.

So beta*gamma=0.9937 *8.918≈8.844.

Then, delta= beta gamma c tau_0 * ln(10/3).

c tau_0=24e-8 m.

So delta=8.844 *24e-8 *1.20397.

Compute 8.844 *24e-8: 8.844 *24= 212.256 → 212.256e-8 =2.12256e-6 m.

Then multiply by 1.20397: 2.12256e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.558e-6 m, which is about 2.56e-6 m.

That's even further from the options.

Hmm, but the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the initial approach was correct, and perhaps the calculation should be done more accurately.

Let me compute gamma =27/3.41 exactly.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13 left.

3.13 ÷3.41 → let's compute 3.41 *0.917=3.12557, which is about 3.13. So 27/3.41=7.9179.

gamma=7.9179.

Then, beta= sqrt(1-1/(7.9179^2)).

Compute 7.9179 squared: 7.9179 *7.9179.

Let me compute it accurately.

7 *7 =49.

7 *0.9179=6.4253.

0.9179 *7=6.4253.

0.9179 *0.9179 ≈0.8425.

So,

(7 +0.9179)^2 =7^2 + 2*7*0.9179 +0.9179^2=49 +12.8506 +0.8425 ≈62.7.

Wait, precise calculation:

7.9179 ×7.9179:

= (7.9 +0.0179)^2.

=7.9^2 + 2*7.9 *0.0179 +0.0179^2.

=62.41 + 0.27518 +0.00032041≈62.6855.

So 1/gamma²=1/62.6855≈0.01595.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920 (since 0.992^2=0.984064).

So beta=0.9920.

So beta*gamma=0.9920 *7.9179= 0.9920 *7=6.944, 0.9920 *0.9179=0.910.

So total is 7.854.

So beta gamma=7.854.

So delta=7.854 * c tau_0 * (-ln(0.3)).

c tau_0=3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7 =7.854 *2.4 =18.8496 → 18.8496e-7=1.88496e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.88496e-6 *1.20397=2.268e-6 m.

So approximately 2.27e-6 m.

But the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.917 times this value.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to use the mean lifetime, not the proper lifetime. Wait, no, because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is the mean lifetime in the rest frame.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the minimum value that the detector can resolve. So if the decay length is smaller than the resolution, you can't see it. But the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So if the detector has a resolution (Δ) such that 30% of the decays have decay lengths longer than Δ, then Δ is the minimum resolution needed.

But the calculation gives delta=2.27e-6 m, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 27/3.41 exactly.

3.41 ×7.917=27?

Let me do 3.41 ×7.917.

First, 3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×0.917: let's compute 3.41 *0.9=3.069; 3.41*0.017=0.05797. So total 3.069+0.05797=3.12697.

So 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697≈27. So 27/3.41=7.917.

So beta*gamma=0.9920 *7.917=7.854.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the exact value of delta.

delta = beta gamma c tau_0 * (-ln(0.3)).

Plugging the values:

beta gamma c tau_0 =7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7= 7.854 *2.4=18.8496 → 18.8496e-7=1.88496e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.88496e-6 *1.20397.

Let me compute this accurately.

1.88496e-6 *1.20397 = (1.88496 *1.20397) *1e-6.

Compute 1.88496 ×1.20397.

1.88496 ×1.2 = 2.261952.

1.88496 ×0.00397≈approx 0.007436.

So total ≈2.261952 +0.007436=2.269388.

So 2.269388e-6 m ≈2.269e-6 m.

Hmm, so 2.269e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Wait, perhaps the correct value is 2.08e-6 m, which is option A. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check where.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should use the average decay length, not the value for 30%. Because the average decay length is around 1.88e-6 m. So perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, but that's not what the question says.

The question says minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the answer is about the 70th percentile of the decay length distribution, which is at 30% of the events. But my calculation gives 2.27e-6 m, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is simpler. Let's compute the decay length and then see if it matches any option.

Compute L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So, L =0.992 *7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step:

0.992 *7.917 ≈7.854.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 *2.4e-7 =1.88496e-6 m=1.885e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 m=1.885 micrometers.

The average decay length is about 1.885 micrometers. So the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution must be less than the average decay length so that 30% of the events are observed. Wait no, the average is the mean, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the average decay length. But option A is 2.08e-6 m=2.08 micrometers. Which is bigger than 1.885 micrometers. So if the detector's resolution is 2.08 micrometers, the decay length must be larger than that, which would happen in only a fraction of the cases.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the thinking. If the detector can resolve down to delta, then the fraction of decays observed is P(L>delta). We need this to be at least 30%.

So, as before, delta=beta gamma c tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Because P(L>delta)=0.3 → 1 - exp(-delta/(L_avg))=0.3 → exp(-delta/L_avg)=0.7 → delta= L_avg * ln(1/0.7)= L_avg * 0.35667.

Because ln(1/0.7)= ln(1.4286)=approx 0.35667.

So L_avg is beta gamma c tau_0=1.885e-6 m.

So delta=1.885e-6 *0.35667≈6.7e-7 m=670 nm, which is 0.67e-6 m. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance that the detector can resolve, which is the resolution, and that the decay length must be longer than that to be observed. So the minimum resolution would be the maximum of the decay length. But that doesn't make sense because higher energies would lead to longer decay lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the decay length itself, and that is the resolution needed. But that would be the average decay length, which is about 1.88e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 1.1 times 1.88e-6 m. So maybe I'm missing a factor of sqrt(2) or something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would be the decay length corresponding to 30% of the events. So using the exponential distribution, 30% corresponds to delta = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L_avg * ln(1/0.7)= L_avg *0.3567.

Wait, 1.885e-6 m *0.3567≈0.67e-6 m=670 nm. But that's not any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution such that the detector can resolve at least 30% of the decays. So the minimum resolution is the value where 70% of decays are below and 30% are above. So the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations I've done lead me to approximately 2.27e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the decay length as L = beta gamma c tau_0, and that is the resolution needed. So L=1.885e-6 m, which would be about 1.88 micrometers. Since the options don't have that, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, perhaps it's a miscalculation in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute beta and gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma=27/3.41.

3.41 *7.917=27. So gamma=7.917.

Compute beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

gamma²=7.917^2=62.685.

1/gamma²=0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

So beta*gamma=7.917 *0.9920=7.854.

So L = beta*gamma*c*tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L =7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

7.854 *2.4e-7 =1.88496e-6 m.

Which is 1.885e-6 m.

But the option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using relativistic mass or something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution as the average decay length multiplied by 0.7, but that would give 1.32e-6 m, which isn't an option either.

Hmm. I think I've done the calculations correctly. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. But my calculation gives 1.885e-6 m, which is about 89% of option A's value.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach uses the velocity v = c instead of beta c. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because then L would be c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, let me try that. If I mistakenly take v=c, which would be incorrect, but just to see:

L=gamma *c * tau_0.

Gamma=7.917, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.917 *3e8=2.375e9.

2.375e9 *8e-16=1.9e-6 m.

Oh wait, that gives 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

So perhaps I made a mistake in considering beta. Maybe the question assumes that the velocity is approximately c, so beta is taken as 1.

So L=gamma *c * tau_0.

Gamma=7.917.

So L=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16=7.917 *24e-8=1.9e-6 m.

Which is 1.9 micrometers.

Hmm, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher than 1.9e-6 m. But perhaps with more precise gamma and beta calculations, it would be closer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects you to take v=c, which isn't correct, but that would get you to 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects you to calculate the average decay length as L=gamma c tau_0, without considering beta.

But that's not correct because beta is less than 1, so L= beta gamma c tau_0 < gamma c tau_0.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But given the options, the closest is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Another possibility: Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, let me compute delta again with the exact formula.

delta= beta gamma c tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Because P(L>delta)=0.3 → 1-exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0))=0.3 → exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau_0))=0.7 → -delta/(beta gamma c tau_0)=ln(0.7) → delta= (beta gamma c tau_0) * ln(1/0.7).

ln(1/0.7)= ln(1.42857)= approx 0.35667.

So delta= (7.854) * (3e8 m/s *8e-16 s) *0.35667.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

7.854 *2.4e-7=1.88496e-6 m.

1.88496e-6 *0.35667=6.7e-7 m=0.67e-6 m.

That's 0.67 micrometers, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. I think I'll have to go with the calculated average decay length, which is around 1.88e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process of the particle \( X^0 \) with a proper lifetime \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \). The energy of the particle is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The decay length \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light, \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Since \( E \) and \( m c^2 \) are both in GeV, the units simplify, and \( \gamma \) is approximately:

\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relationship between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 7.917 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.917)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.992 \), \( \gamma \approx 7.917 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.992 \cdot 7.917 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 24 \times 10^{-8} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Now calculate \( \beta \gamma c \tau_0 \):

\[
L = 0.992 \cdot 7.917 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the average decay length is approximately \( 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 4: Determine the minimum resolution
The problem asks for the minimum resolution \( \Delta \) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The decay length distribution follows an exponential probability distribution, and the resolution \( \Delta \) must satisfy:

\[
P(L > \Delta) = 0.3
\]

For an exponential distribution, \( P(L > \Delta) = \exp(-\Delta / L_{\text{avg}}) \), where \( L_{\text{avg}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 \). Solving for \( \Delta \):

\[
\Delta = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3)
\]

Substituting \( L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) and \( \ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397 \):

\[
\Delta = 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 1.20397 \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution \( \Delta \approx 2.27 \, \mu\text{m} \) is closest to option **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is the best match among the given options.

ANSWER: A
