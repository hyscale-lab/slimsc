Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of something... Oh wait, it's part of the Wittig reaction. Right, the Wittig reagent is usually made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but in this case, the starting material is reacting with red phosphorus, which I think is part of making a ylide or something similar.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about what the product of this reaction is. Oh right! The Wittig reaction involves the formation of an alkene. The ylide (from the Wittig reagent) attacks the carbonyl group of the starting material, leading to the formation of a new double bond. So, in this case, the starting molecule has two carbonyl groups: one from the formyl group (the aldehyde) and the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid is a carbonyl as well. So how does that react? Oh, wait, maybe the reaction conditions matter. Red phosphorus and HI is a classic reaction for reducing carbonyl groups. Or wait, another thought: when you have a carbonyl reacting with PPh3 and an alkyl halide, it's the Wittig. But in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a different setup. Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Red phosphorus is often used in the formation of the ylide when HI is present. So, perhaps the reaction is a Wittig-type reaction where the ylide is generated from the aldehyde or from the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw the structure mentally. The cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2CH-, but attached as a substituent, probably a double bond nearby. Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring is cyclohexene, with substituents at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond starting at C3, a formyl group at C2, and a vinyl group (like CH2CH2 but actually CH2CH- as a substituent) at C5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, in the presence of HX (like HI), carbonyl groups can be converted into CH2 groups, but it's more common with the use of something like BH3 and other reagents. Alternatively, I think that the reaction of a carbonyl with red phosphorus and HI is a way to form a ylide, which in turn can undergo a Wittig reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction entirely.

Wait, another thought: when carbonyl groups are treated with phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a way to make a diiodide, but more likely, it's the formation of a ylide. The ylide would then attack the carbonyl groups. But wait, the molecule has two carbonyls: the aldehyde (formyl) and the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids are less reactive towards certain reactions. For example, in the presence of a base, they can form the corresponding carboxylate, but in this case, HI is a strong acid, so maybe the carboxylic acid is protonated. Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions allow the Wittig reagent to form, which can attack the more reactive carbonyl group.

Wait, the formyl group (CHO) is more reactive than the carboxylic acid (COOH). So the ylide would likely attack the aldehyde group first. Let me think about the mechanism. The ylide, which is a strong base, would deprotonate the aldehyde's alpha position if possible, but wait, in the Wittig reaction, the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an oxaphosphorane intermediate, which then eliminates to form the alkene and phosphine oxide.

But wait, when the starting material is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the red phosphorus is used to make the ylide. So, the HI would react with the starting material's substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or something else.

Wait, another angle: in the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to the carbonyl, forming a new double bond. So, if the starting material has an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid, perhaps each will react with the ylide. But wait, HI is in excess, and I think that the ylide is formed from the aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the aldehyde into an alkene. Let me think about the product. If the formyl group (CHO) is converted via Wittig to CH2Ph (but wait, no, the ylide would form an alkene). Wait, the ylide has a structure like PR3(+)-CH-R', and when it reacts with a carbonyl, it forms an alkene.

Wait, so the initial molecule has a formyl group, which upon Wittig reaction would form an alkene adjacent to the ring. Similarly, the carboxylic acid group may or may not react. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think again.

The starting material:

Structure: cyclohex-3-ene ring. Positions 2 (adjacent to 3) has a formyl (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So, the substituents are at 2 and 5, and the ring has a double bond at 3-4.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that this is a two-step process. First, the aldehyde group (CHO) reacts with HI and red phosphorus to form a ylide. Then, the ylide reacts with another carbonyl group in the molecule, perhaps the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids are not as reactive toward the Wittig reagent as aldehydes or ketones are. So maybe the aldehyde is the one that reacts first.

Wait, but another thought: under certain conditions, the carboxylic acid can be converted into an acid chloride, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl groups.

Wait, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds. So, if the product has more or fewer rings or double bonds, the index changes.

The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond) plus the formyl group (which is a double bond in the CHO) and the vinyl group (another double bond). Let's count the hydrogen deficiency in the starting material.

The starting molecule: cyclohexene has 4 double bonds (no, wait, double bonds in the ring count once). So, cyclohexene has one double bond. The formyl group has a carbonyl (so that's another double bond), and the vinyl group is a substituent with a double bond (CH2=CH-), so that's another. So, starting material has three double bonds in total. But wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond—so that's one. Then, the formyl group is a carbonyl (another double bond), and the vinyl group is a double bond (third). So, the starting material has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 3.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the index is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me think, but perhaps it's easier to count double bonds and rings. Each ring or pi bond contributes 1 to the index.

So, starting material: cyclohexene (1 ring and 1 double bond?), wait no: cyclohexene is a cyclic compound with a double bond. So, it's a ring plus a double bond. Wait, wait, no: a cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, the ring itself contributes 1 to the index, and the double bond within the ring (as part of the ring) is already accounted for. So, the cyclohexene has 1 double bond (ring plus one double bond? No. Each ring counts as one, each double bond counts as one. Wait, let me clarify: In the formula, each double bond or ring adds 1 to the index.

So, starting molecule:

- One ring (cyclohexane—no, wait, it's a cyclohexene, which is a ring with one double bond. So the ring has one double bond, so it's a ring plus a double bond. Wait no, it's a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, the ring is a cyclohexene, which is a ring with one double bond. So, the ring contributes 1 (for the ring) and the double bond adds another? Or is the ring's double bond part of the ring count?

Wait, no. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the number of rings plus the number of double bonds. So, a cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond (since the ring is formed with a double bond). Wait, no, a cyclohexene is a ring with six members and one double bond. So, the ring itself is a ring (counts as one), and the double bond inside the ring is a separate double bond, so that would be two hydrogen deficiencies. But wait, no, because the ring is formed by the double bond. So, the ring is a single unit. So, cyclohexene has one ring (count as 1) and one double bond (but it's part of the ring, so maybe it's already included).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula. The formula is: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

So, for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, let's find its structure and calculate the DoU.

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the product undergoes some reaction that changes the number of rings and double bonds.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group and the vinyl group undergo some reaction. Wait, when HI is in excess, maybe the aldehyde is converted into an alkane. Because, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde (CHO) can be converted into CH2 group. Wait, I think that's the case. Let me recall: the reaction of aldehydes with red phosphorus and HI is a way to reduce the aldehyde group to CH2. So, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2.

So, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO) which upon reaction becomes CH2. So, the aldehyde is converted into a methylene group. What about the carboxylic acid group? Well, in the presence of HI, perhaps it's protonated, but I'm not sure if it undergoes any reaction. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is converted to an acid chloride, but that's with PCl5, not HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the carboxylic acid could be converted into an acyl chloride, but I think that requires something like thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or phosphorus oxychloride. Red phosphorus and HI might not do that. So perhaps the carboxylic acid group remains as is.

Wait, but in the reaction conditions, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, but since HI is a strong acid, it's probably protonated. So, perhaps the carboxylic acid remains as a COOH group.

So, the product would have the cyclohexene ring, the formyl group converted into CH2, and the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) perhaps reacting as well.

Wait, but another possibility: the vinyl group is a substituent, and in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, maybe it undergoes some addition. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) remains unchanged.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's structure is such that the formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl at position 5. So, when the formyl group is converted to CH2, the substituent becomes CH2 in the ring. So, the ring would have a CH2 group at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 5.

So, the product would be 2-(cyclohexenylmethyl)-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid? No, perhaps more precise:

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, after conversion of CHO to CH2, it becomes 2-(methylene)cyclohexenyl... Hmm, perhaps I should think of the product as 2-(CH2)-cyclohexene with a vinyl group.

Wait, but the product's structure: the ring remains cyclohexene, the formyl becomes CH2, and the vinyl group remains. So, the product is 2-(methylidene)cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with a vinyl substituent at position 5.

Wait, but how does this affect the index of hydrogen deficiency?

Original starting material: cyclohex-3-ene has one double bond (ring plus one). The formyl group adds another double bond (CHO), and the vinyl group adds another (CH2=CH-). So, three double bonds: ring (1), formyl (1), and vinyl (1). So, index 3.

But wait, the cyclohexene ring is actually a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the ring is one and the double bond is part of it, so that's one hydrogen deficiency. Then the formyl is another (CHO), and the vinyl is another (CH2=CH-). So, three in total.

Now, the product, after the reaction, would have:

- The ring: still cyclohexene, so one double bond (same as before).

- The formyl group becomes CH2, which is a single bond, so that double bond is gone.

- The vinyl group is still present (CH2=CH-), so that's another double bond.

So, total hydrogen deficiency is: 1 (ring) + 1 (vinyl) = 2.

Wait, but wait: is the ring's double bond still present? If the reaction doesn't affect the ring, then yes. So the ring's double bond remains, the formyl is converted to CH2 (so no double bond there), and the vinyl is still present. So, two double bonds.

Wait, but the starting material had three, the product has two. So the index would decrease by one, from 3 to 2. But looking at the options, the choices are 1,3,5,0. Hmm, none of these is 2. So perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the starting material's index. Let me recalculate.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Let me write its formula. The base is cyclohexene (C6H10). The substituents at positions 2 and 5: formyl (CHO) adds one carbon and one oxygen, and vinyl (CH2=CH-) adds two carbons and a double bond. And the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) adds two oxygen, two carbons, and an -OH. Wait, no, let me count the carbons correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the molecular formula.

The base is cyclohexene: C6H10.

At position 2: formyl (CHO) adds one C, one O.

At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH-) adds two C and one O? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent, so that's two carbons, but attached as CH2-CH2 with a double bond in between.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula.

The molecule is:

- A cyclohexene ring (C6H10).

- At position 2: a formyl group (CHO): which is -CH=O.

- At position 5: a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), so that's a substituent of -CH2-CH2, but with a double bond: actually, it's -CH2-CH2, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached as -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no: the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's a substituent with a double bond. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the two carbons. So it's a substituent with a double bond.

So, the formula would be:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Formyl: adds one C, one O.

Vinyl: adds two C (but one is from the ring, so maybe it's an exocyclic double bond?).

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is better calculated.

The base is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Adding a formyl group (CHO) as a substituent: that's one C, one O, and one CHO group.

Adding a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) as a substituent: that's two C, one O (from the double bond?), but wait, no, the double bond is part of the substituent, so maybe it doesn't add oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H10O3.

Wait, let's count:

Cyclohexene: 6 C.

Formyl: 1 C.

Vinyl: 2 C.

Carboxylic acid: -COOH is 2 O and 2 C? No, wait, the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Wait, no, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 3. So, that adds two O (from COOH) and one more C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the actual structure.

Let me try to write the structure:

The cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2, 3, and 5.

Position 2: formyl (CHO).

Position 3: carboxylic acid (COOH).

Position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH-).

So, the ring is six-membered, with a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene).

So, the substituents are:

- C2: CHO.

- C3: COOH.

- C5: CH2=CH-.

Wait, that's three substituents, but the numbering might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at 2 and 5, and the double bond is between 3 and 4.

Wait, regardless, the key point is that in the product, the aldehyde group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2. The vinyl group remains as is, and the ring's double bond remains.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring (double bond between C3 and C4).

- At C2: CH2 (previously CHO).

- At C5: CH2=CH-.

- At C3: COOH.

So, what's the index of hydrogen deficiency for this product?

The ring contributes 1.

The vinyl group at C5 contributes another (the double bond).

So, that's 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the reaction. What if the reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't just reduce the aldehyde but also the carboxylic acid group?

But I don't think that's the case because carboxylic acids are less reactive towards Wittig reagents. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed through a Wittig mechanism.

Wait, another thought: when red phosphorus is used with HI, it can lead to the conversion of carbonyl groups into CH2 groups. For example, aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to CH2 groups. So, the reaction conditions are such that the aldehyde (CHO) is converted to CH2, and the same applies to the carboxylic acid group. Wait, but that seems unlikely because carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think: another reaction of HI with carbonyl groups. I think that when a carbonyl is treated with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it can form a ylide, which will then form an alkene. But perhaps the aldehyde group is the one that reacts.

Wait, the initial reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I believe is the formation of a ylide (Wittig reagent). The ylide would attack the aldehyde group (the more reactive one), forming an alkene. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2 with a new double bond formed elsewhere.

Wait, so the aldehyde group (CHO) would react with the Wittig reagent to form a new double bond. So, the product would have an additional double bond from the Wittig reaction.

Wait, that's a different outcome than I thought earlier. Let me think again.

The starting material has a formyl group. The Wittig reaction would convert the aldehyde into an alkene. So, the product would have a new double bond where the aldehyde was. So, the original ring double bond (1) and the new one from the Wittig reaction (another) plus the vinyl group's double bond (3rd). So, the product would have three double bonds.

Wait, but the vinyl group is part of the substituent. So, the starting material's vinyl group is a substituent, perhaps as part of the ring.

Wait, no, in the starting material, the vinyl group is a substituent attached to the ring. So, when the aldehyde is converted into an alkene via Wittig, the product would have that new double bond adjacent to where the formyl group was.

So, the product would have:

- The ring's double bond (still present).

- The new double bond from the Wittig reaction (from the aldehyde).

- The vinyl group's double bond.

Total of three double bonds.

But wait, the ring's double bond is at position 3-4, the new one would be adjacent to position 2 (where the formyl was), and the vinyl group's double bond is at position 5. So, three double bonds in the product.

So, the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 3. But wait, the starting material already had three, and if the Wittig adds another (but in this case, the aldehyde's double bond is replaced with a new alkene), perhaps the number doesn't change.

Wait, the aldehyde group (CHO) has a double bond. The Wittig reaction replaces that with a new double bond. So, the number of double bonds remains the same.

So, in the starting material: 3 double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl).

After Wittig: the formyl's double bond is replaced with a new one, so the count is still 3. So, the index remains 3.

But the options have B as 3. So, if the product has the same number of double bonds as the starting material, the index would be the same.

Wait, but wait, what about the carboxylic acid group? Does it undergo any reaction? If the carboxylic acid is converted into something else, that might change the index.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a Wittig but a different type of addition. For example, in the presence of excess HI, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into an alkyl iodide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dienophile, and under certain conditions, it forms a new ring. But that's probably not the case.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of the ylide. The ylide would attack the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of an alkene. So, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be converted into an alkene.

So, in the product, the formyl group is replaced by a new alkene. So, the product would have:

- The ring's double bond (1).

- The new double bond from the aldehyde's transformation (2).

- The vinyl group's double bond (3).

So, three double bonds. So, the index is 3.

Looking at the options, option B is 3. So, the answer would be B.

Wait, but another possibility: the reaction also affects the carboxylic acid group. For example, maybe the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, but I don't think so because that typically requires other reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid, leaving it as is. So, the product has three double bonds.

So, the index remains 3. So, the answer is B) 3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The starting material has the following structural features:

1. A cyclohexene ring (C6H10) with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.
2. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5.
4. A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 3.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule. Each ring and each double bond contribute 1 to the index. 

### Hydrogen Deficiency of the Starting Material:
- The cyclohexene ring contributes 1 (1 ring + 1 double bond).
- The formyl group contributes 1 (from the carbonyl double bond).
- The vinyl group contributes 1 (from its double bond).
- The carboxylic acid group does not contribute to hydrogen deficiency as it does not contain a double bond or ring.

Thus, the starting material has **3 double bonds (1 from the ring, 1 from the formyl group, and 1 from the vinyl group)**, giving it an index of hydrogen deficiency of **3**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI:
The reaction involves the formation of a Wittig reagent, which reacts with the aldehyde group (CHO) to form a new alkene. This reaction replaces the aldehyde's carbonyl double bond with a new double bond. Importantly, the reaction does not affect the carboxylic acid group or the vinyl group.

### Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product:
- The cyclohexene ring retains its double bond.
- The aldehyde group is converted into a new alkene, retaining one double bond.
- The vinyl group retains its double bond.

Thus, the product retains **3 double bonds (1 from the ring, 1 from the new alkene, and 1 from the vinyl group)**, giving it an index of hydrogen deficiency of **3**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.
