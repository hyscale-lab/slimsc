Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being a different power law. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, if I imagine a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? The stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their positions are spread out in space in a uniform way.

Wait, but uniform distribution in the sky doesn't directly translate to uniform distribution in distance. Because as distance increases, the volume of space increases, so more stars would be in a larger volume. But since the distribution is uniform, the number density of stars is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

Let me think about the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But wait, for a given parallax range, like plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distances are from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, maybe I should approximate because for small dplx, the change in distance is small. So, perhaps I can model this as a thin shell between distances d and d + dd, where dd is small.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the differential volume between two spherical shells. The volume between d and d + dd would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd. So the volume element is 4πd² dd.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars in a thin shell would be N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume). But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is dplx. So I need to express this in terms of dplx.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The change in parallax dplx would correspond to a change in distance dd. Let's relate dd to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, differentiating both sides gives dplx = - (1/d²) dd. Wait, so dd = - d² dplx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering small increments, I can take the absolute value. So, |dd| = d² dplx.

Substituting d = 1/plx, so |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx. Now, going back to the number of stars in the volume element. The number of stars in the shell between d and d+dd (which corresponds to plx and plx + dplx) is N = n * 4π d² |dd|.

Plugging in |dd|, we get N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, let me re-express this correctly. Wait, d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². And |dd| is (1/plx²) dplx. So putting it all together:

N = n * 4π (1 / plx²) * (1 / plx²) dplx? No, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me redo this.

Wait, the volume element (dV) is 4πd² dd. So, dV = 4π (d)^2 dd. But since dd = (d²) dplx (from earlier), substituting d in terms of plx:

d = 1/plx → d^2 = 1/(plx)^2
dd = (1/(plx)^2) dplx

So dV = 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx)^2) dplx )? Wait, that can't be right because d and dd were each in terms of plx. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the substitution should be:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d² dplx) [since dd = d² dplx]

Wait, no. Because d = 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2. And dd is d² dplx → (1/plx)^2 dplx.

So, substituting:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx )

Wait, that would make dV proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx, which seems high. But maybe that's correct.

But wait, let me double-check. Parallax plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

dd is the change in d when plx changes by dplx. So, d = 1/plx → differentiating both sides: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → so |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume between d and d+dd is the volume of a thin shell, which is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness (dd). So:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx 

So, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx 

Yes, that's correct.

Since the number of stars in this volume element is N = n * dV, and n is the number density (stars per volume), so:

N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx 

But the question is about the number per unit plx range. So, N per dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question says "number of stars per unit range of plx (plx)". So actually, it's N per dplx, which is (n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx) / dplx → n * 4π (1/plx^4)

So, the number is inversely proportional to plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. I thought earlier that the number of stars would decrease more slowly. Let me think again.

Wait, let's think about the distribution. Let's imagine a uniform distribution of stars in space. So, the number density n is constant. The volume element as a function of distance is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d² dd.

But in terms of parallax, since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/(plx)^2 and dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the number:

N = n * 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) dplx ) → which is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So N per dplx is (N/dplx) = n *4π (1/plx^4) → so the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you go from three dimensions to a 1D range, the scaling can be different. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. For a given range of plx, the corresponding volume is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 1/plx^4. So per unit plx, it's 1/plx^4.

So yeah, option A should be correct.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin shell of stars at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the corresponding range of parallax is \( \text{dplx} \), and the relationship between \( dd \) and \( \text{dplx} \) is \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, \text{dplx} \).

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, \text{dplx} \), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, \text{dplx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, \text{dplx}.
\]

Since the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, the number of stars in this shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, \text{dplx},
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars. Dividing by \( \text{dplx} \), the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{N}{\text{dplx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.
