Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's see what I can do. The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds like a neutralization reaction or something.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base I have and see if they neutralize each other completely or if there's excess. Then, depending on what's left, I can find the pH.

Let's break down the given information. 

The solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). 

So, for each solution:

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
2. HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
3. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total moles of H+ ions from the acids: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, in these kinds of problems, sometimes you can consider that all the H+ comes from the strong acid. Or do I need to account for the acetic acid's contribution? Hmm, I think in such neutralization problems, we can treat the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) as the main contributor, and then see if the weak acid's H+ is negligible or if it's a factor. But maybe, since it's a weak acid, its H+ might not be significant compared to the strong acid and the base. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, but the problem is about mixing all three solutions, so the total H+ and OH- will come from all sources. So perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and total OH- in the mixture, then see which is in excess, and then calculate the concentration of H+ or OH- based on that.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully donate H+. So perhaps I need to treat it differently. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps in this scenario, the strong acids and strong bases will react completely, and the weak acid's contribution can be considered after that. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Hold on, let's approach this step by step.

First, calculate the total H+ from HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. So 0.08 moles of HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, the Ba(OH)2 contributes OH- ions. Since it's a strong base, it fully dissociates. 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ available is 0.08 (from HCl) plus any H+ from CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its H+ isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the H+ from CH3COOH will be negligible compared to the strong acid and base, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will proceed first, and then any remaining H+ or OH- will determine the pH. But since the CH3COOH is a weak acid, perhaps its H+ will be considered after the strong acid and base have reacted.

Wait, but maybe it's better to calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions, including from CH3COOH, but that might complicate things. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be treated as follows:

1. Calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids (including CH3COOH) and the total moles of OH- from the base.

2. Subtract OH- from H+ to see if there's excess H+ (acidic solution) or excess OH- (basic solution).

3. If there's excess, determine the concentration of H+ or OH- in the solution, then find the pH.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ as HCl. But in the presence of a strong acid like HCl, the weak acid's H+ might be negligible. Or maybe not, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the H+ from the weak acid can be calculated using the dissociation constant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat all the H+ from CH3COOH as available, but I think that's not correct because it's a weak acid.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, let's calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture before any reactions.

H+ sources: HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. Let me calculate the moles of H+ it can contribute. The formula for CH3COOH is CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H+ (but only partially ionized). The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 x 10^-5. But calculating this might complicate things, especially if the solution is not at standard conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Let me check the numbers.

HCl contributes 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.18 moles OH-.

So when H+ and OH- meet, they neutralize each other:

moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10 → but can't have negative, so all H+ is neutralized, and there's excess OH-.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The total H+ from HCl is 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So the OH- will react with the H+.

So H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

So, reaction: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Now, after this, there's 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Additionally, we have the H+ from CH3COOH. But wait, the CH3COOH is in the same solution as HCl and Ba(OH)2, so the OH- might have reacted with the H+ from the CH3COOH as well.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The OH- will neutralize all available H+ regardless of the source. So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, first, OH- reacts with H+ from HCl.

HCl provides 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles OH-.

So, 0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 H2O. Now, 0.10 moles of OH- remain.

Next, the OH- will react with H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH initially has 0.05 moles. But as a weak acid, how much H+ does it contribute?

Wait, but after adding OH- which is a strong base, the OH- will neutralize any H+ from CH3COOH as well.

So, the 0.10 moles of OH- can react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all its H+. The initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05. When added to the solution, it can donate some H+, but in the presence of OH- from the Ba(OH)2, the OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, let's model this. Let me think: the OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

The reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- consumes a mole of CH3COOH and produces a mole of CH3COO^-.

So, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left after reacting with HCl.

CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

So, OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, converting all of it into CH3COO^-.

So, after that, all 0.10 moles of OH- are used up. But wait, wait: We have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH: each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.

After neutralizing the HCl's H+ (0.08), the OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The OH- will react with it as follows:

Each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.10 moles of OH- can react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, but we only have 0.05 moles. So all the CH3COOH (0.05 moles) will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after this reaction, the OH- left is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait another moment: The initial OH- after HCl reaction is 0.10.

We have CH3COOH = 0.05 moles.

OH- will react with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and using up all the CH3COOH. The remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, total OH- is 0.05 moles.

So, the solution now has:

- 0.05 moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2)
- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- (the conjugate base of acetic acid)
- And any other ions?

Wait, but wait: the HCl and Ba(OH)2 were both strong acid and base, so their ions are present as well.

Wait, no. Let me think about the ions after all reactions.

HCl (HCl → H+ + Cl^-)

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-

CH3COOH is CH3COOH → (partially) CH3COO^- + H+.

But when OH- is present, it will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, in the mixture:

After all reactions, the ions present would be:

- Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.09 moles of Ba^2+.
- Cl^- from HCl: 0.08 moles.
- CH3COO^-: 0.05 moles (from the reaction with OH-)
- OH^-: 0.05 moles (left after reacting with CH3COOH)
- Any other ions?

Wait, but wait, the H+ from HCl would have been neutralized by OH-.

So, the solution's pH depends on the excess OH- or H+. Since we have 0.05 moles of OH- left, the solution is basic.

But wait, let me think again: after all reactions, the remaining ions would be OH- (0.05 moles), Ba^2+ (0.09 moles), Cl^- (0.08 moles), and CH3COO^- (0.05 moles).

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait. If we have excess OH- after neutralizing all the H+ sources, then the pH is determined by the OH- concentration.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38.

So, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Hmm, that would correspond to option A) 12.62.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because CH3COO^- is a weak base. Could that affect the pH? Because CH3COO^- can accept a proton (H+) from water, making the solution more basic.

Wait, yes! Because CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, increasing the OH- concentration and making the solution more basic.

So, I have to consider both the OH- from the excess and the OH- produced by the acetate ions.

Hmm, that complicates things. I initially thought that the OH- from the Ba(OH)2 is the only source, but the acetate ions also contribute OH-.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the total OH- concentration considering both sources.

But wait, how?

So, let's approach this.

After the neutralization reactions, the solution has:

- 0.05 moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2 not neutralized)
- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

The CH3COO^- will undergo hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

This reaction will produce more OH- ions, increasing the solution's basicity.

So, the total OH- concentration is the sum of the initial OH- and the OH- produced by the acetate ions.

But wait, that's perhaps an oversimplification because the hydrolysis of acetate is an equilibrium, and it's not straightforward to just add the moles. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it using the Kb of acetate.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb, which means the hydrolysis of acetate is minimal, so the OH- contribution from acetate is negligible.

But wait, in this case, we have 0.05 moles of acetate in 1.2 L, which is a concentration of approximately 0.0417 M.

So, the Kb is 5.56e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.0417 M, and we can set up an ICE table.

Let x be the concentration of OH- produced.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.0417 - x ≈ 0.0417 (since Kb is very small)
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x + 0.0417 (from initial OH- and the added x)

Wait, no. Wait, the initial OH- comes from the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2. But if we have 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L, that's [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

So, the initial OH- concentration is 0.04167 M.

But when the acetate hydrolyzes, it will add some more OH-.

So, the total [OH-] is 0.04167 + x.

But the Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

But since x is much smaller than 0.0417, we can approximate [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.0417.

So,

5.56e-10 = (x)(0.04167 + x) / 0.0417.

But since x is small, 0.04167 + x ≈ 0.04167.

So,

5.56e-10 ≈ (x * 0.04167) / 0.0417.

Simplify:

5.56e-10 ≈ x * (0.04167/0.0417) ≈ x * 0.999 ≈ x.

So, x ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, the additional OH- from acetate is about 5.56e-10 M, which is negligible compared to the initial 0.04167 M.

Therefore, the acetate's contribution to OH- is insignificant.

So, the main source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2, which is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

So, the [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

So, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, the pH is approximately 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Total moles of OH- after all reactions is 0.05.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the presence of excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 is the main factor, and the acetate's contribution is negligible, so the pH is 12.62.

But wait, another thing: when you mix all the solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L.

Let me recheck the initial moles:

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 moles OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles.

So, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So, OH- neutralizes H+:

OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH can donate a H+ (as it's an acid), so OH- (0.10 mol) will neutralize 0.10 mol of CH3COOH, but we only have 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 mol OH- reacts with CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, yes, 0.05 mol OH- remains.

So, the calculation was correct.

Thus, the pH is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
1. **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):**  
   Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **HCl (hydrochloric acid):**  
   Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide):**  
   Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Reaction between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂):**  
   \[
   \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
   After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) remains.

2. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH:**  
   \[
   \text{OH}^- + \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]  
   CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), and the remaining OH⁻ is \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).  
   All \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of CH₃COOH reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of OH⁻
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is given by:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's see what I can do. The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide.

The solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). 

So, for each solution:

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
2. HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
3. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total moles of H+ ions from the acids: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, in these kinds of problems, sometimes you can consider that all the H+ comes from the strong acid. Or do I need to account for the acetic acid's contribution? Hmm, I think in such neutralization problems, we can treat the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) as the main contributor, and then see if the weak acid's H+ is negligible or if it's a factor.

Then, the Ba(OH)2 contributes OH- ions. Since it's a strong base, it fully dissociates. 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, let's calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture before any reactions.

H+ sources: HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. Let me calculate the moles of H+ it can contribute. The formula for CH3COOH is CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H+ (but only partially ionized). The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 x 10^-5. But calculating this might complicate things, especially if the solution is not at standard conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Let me check the numbers.

HCl contributes 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.18 moles OH-.

So when H+ and OH- meet, they neutralize each other:

moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10 → but can't have negative, so all H+ is neutralized, and there's excess OH-.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The total H+ from HCl is 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So the OH- will react with the H+.

So H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

So, reaction: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Now, after this, there's 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Additionally, we have the H+ from CH3COOH. But wait, the CH3COOH is in the same solution as HCl and Ba(OH)2, so the OH- might have reacted with the H+ from the CH3COOH as well.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The OH- will neutralize all available H+ regardless of the source. So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, first, OH- reacts with H+ from HCl.

HCl provides 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles OH-.

So, 0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 H2O. Now, 0.10 moles of OH- remain.

Next, the OH- will react with H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH initially has 0.05 moles. But as a weak acid, how much H+ does it contribute?

Wait, but after adding OH- which is a strong base, the OH- will neutralize any H+ from CH3COOH as well.

So, the 0.10 moles of OH- can react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all its H+. The initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05. When added to the solution, it can donate some H+, but in the presence of OH- from the Ba(OH)2, the OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, let's model this. Let me think: the OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

The reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- consumes a mole of CH3COOH and produces a mole of CH3COO^-.

So, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left after reacting with HCl.

CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

So, OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, converting all of it into CH3COO^-.

So, after that, all 0.10 moles of OH- are used up. But wait, wait: We have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH: each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.

After neutralizing the HCl's H+ (0.08), the OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The OH- will react with it as follows:

Each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.10 moles of OH- can react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, but we only have 0.05 moles. So all the CH3COOH (0.05 moles) will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after this reaction, the OH- left is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait another moment: The initial OH- after HCl reaction is 0.10.

We have CH3COOH = 0.05 moles.

OH- will react with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and using up all the CH3COOH. The remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, total OH- is 0.05 moles.

So, the solution now has:

- 0.05 moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2)
- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- (the conjugate base of acetic acid)
- And any other ions?

Wait, but wait: the HCl and Ba(OH)2 were both strong acid and base, so their ions are present as well.

Wait, no. Let me think about the ions after all reactions.

HCl (HCl → H+ + Cl^-)

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-

CH3COOH is CH3COOH → (partially) CH3COO^- + H+.

But when OH- is present, it will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, in the mixture:

After all reactions, the ions present would be:

- Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.09 moles of Ba^2+.
- Cl^- from HCl: 0.08 moles.
- CH3COO^-: 0.05 moles (from the reaction with OH-)
- OH^-: 0.05 moles (left after reacting with CH3COOH)
- Any other ions?

Wait, but wait, the H+ from HCl would have been neutralized by OH-.

So, the solution's pH depends on the excess OH- or H+. Since we have 0.05 moles of OH- left, the solution is basic.

But wait, let me think again: after all reactions, the remaining ions would be OH- (0.05 moles), Ba^2+ (0.09 moles), Cl^- (0.08 moles), and CH3COO^- (0.05 moles).

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait. If we have excess OH- after neutralizing all the H+ sources, then the pH is determined by the OH- concentration.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38.

So, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Hmm, that would correspond to option A) 12.62.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because CH3COO^- is a weak base. Could that affect the pH? Because CH3COO^- can accept a proton (H+) from water, making the solution more basic.

Wait, yes! Because CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, increasing the OH- concentration and making the solution more basic.

So, I have to consider both the OH- from the excess and the OH- produced by the acetate ions.

Hmm, that complicates things. I initially thought that the OH- from the Ba(OH)2 is the only source, but the acetate ions also contribute OH-.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the total OH- concentration considering both sources.

But wait, how?

So, let's approach this.

After the neutralization reactions, the solution has:

- 0.05 moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2 not neutralized)
- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

The CH3COO^- will undergo hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

This reaction will produce more OH- ions, increasing the solution's basicity.

So, the total OH- concentration is the sum of the initial OH- and the OH- produced by the acetate ions.

But wait, that's perhaps an oversimplification because the hydrolysis of acetate is an equilibrium, and it's not straightforward to just add the moles. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it using the Kb of acetate.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb, which means the hydrolysis of acetate is minimal, so the OH- contribution from acetate is negligible.

But wait, in this case, we have 0.05 moles of acetate in 1.2 L, which is a concentration of approximately 0.0417 M.

So, the Kb is 5.56e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.0417 M, and we can set up an ICE table.

Let x be the concentration of OH- produced.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.0417 - x ≈ 0.0417 (since Kb is very small)
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x + 0.0417 (from initial OH- and the added x)

Wait, no. Wait, the initial OH- comes from the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2. But if we have 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L, that's [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

So, the initial OH- concentration is 0.04167 M.

But when the acetate hydrolyzes, it will add some more OH-.

So, the total [OH-] is 0.04167 + x.

But the Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

But since x is much smaller than 0.0417, we can approximate [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.0417.

So,

5.56e-10 = (x)(0.04167 + x) / 0.0417.

But since x is small, 0.04167 + x ≈ 0.04167.

So,

5.56e-10 ≈ (x * 0.04167) / 0.0417.

Simplify:

5.56e-10 ≈ x * (0.04167/0.0417) ≈ x * 0.999 ≈ x.

So, x ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, the additional OH- from acetate is about 5.56e-10 M, which is negligible compared to the initial 0.04167 M.

Therefore, the acetate's contribution to OH- is insignificant.

So, the main source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2, which is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

So, the [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

So, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, the pH is approximately 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Total moles of OH- after all reactions is 0.05.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the presence of excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 is the main factor, and the acetate's contribution is negligible, so the pH is 12.62.

But wait, another thing: when you mix all the solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L.

Let me recheck the initial moles:

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 moles OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles.

So, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So, OH- neutralizes H+:

OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH can donate a H+ (as it's an acid), so OH- (0.10 mol) will neutralize 0.10 mol of CH3COOH, but we only have 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 mol OH- reacts with CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, yes, 0.05 mol OH- remains.

So, the calculation was correct.

Thus, the pH is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
1. **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):**  
   Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **HCl (hydrochloric acid):**  
   Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide):**  
   Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Reaction between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂):**  
   \[
   \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
   After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) remains.

2. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH:**  
   \[
   \text{OH}^- + \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]  
   CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), and the remaining OH⁻ is \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).  
   All \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of CH₃COOH reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of OH⁻
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is given by:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.
