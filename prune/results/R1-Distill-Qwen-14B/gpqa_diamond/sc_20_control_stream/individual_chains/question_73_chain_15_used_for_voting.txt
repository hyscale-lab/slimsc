Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition because of relativity effects. Oh right, there's the relativistic velocity addition formula for finding the relative speed between two objects moving at significant fractions of c.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference divided by that denominator. Let me plug in the numbers.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that denominator: (0.3 c²)/c² is 0.3, so 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, so approximately 0.14c when rounded. That's one part done.

Now for the total energy. I think the total energy of each astronaut would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c): gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². But wait, is that correct? Oh wait, the question is about the total energy of the system. So yes, just sum the energies of each astronaut.

Looking at the options, option C says relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has the same relative speed but E=5 mc². So our calculations point to option C or D. Let's double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with E2. Let's compute gamma2 again. 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 = approx 3.464. So E2 is 3.464 mc², and E1 is 2.5 mc². Adding gives around 5.964, which is about 5.96 mc². So the total energy is 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct option is C.

Wait but looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. Option D has v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2. So C is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy of the system is \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c): gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². But wait, is that correct? Oh wait, the question is about the total energy of the system. So yes, just sum the energies of each astronaut.

So E2 is 3.464 mc², and E1 is 2.5 mc². Adding gives around 5.964, which is about 5.96 mc². So the total energy is 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct option is C.

Wait but looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. Option D has v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2. So C is the correct one.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy of the system is \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
