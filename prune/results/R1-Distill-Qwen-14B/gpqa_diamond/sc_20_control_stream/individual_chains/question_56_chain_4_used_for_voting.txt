Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions, right. So I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. I think for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, right? Or wait, is it that m can change by 0 or ±1?

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It needs to decay to |1,0,0⟩ through two steps. So, each step would be a dipole transition. So first, from n=3 to some lower n, then from there to n=1.

Wait, n has to decrease by a certain amount each time. Let me think: each transition can change n by ±1, but in emission (since it's decaying), n decreases. So from 3, the first transition could go to n=2 or maybe lower? But from 3 to 1 in two steps. So 3→2 and then 2→1.

But wait, what about the angular momentum quantum numbers? The initial state has l=0, m=0. So for the first transition, since l can only change by ±1, from l=0, the next l must be 1. So after the first transition, l becomes 1.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m? Because l can't jump more than 1. So from l=0 to l=1. Then, the second transition would go from l=1 to l=0, since we have to end at l=0 in the final state.

So let's think about the possible m changes. For each transition, m can change by -1, 0, +1. So in the first transition, m starts at 0. So possible m after first transition could be -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, it has to go from whatever m was to 0.

Wait, the final state is m=0. So when the second transition happens, from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the m must go from m to 0. So the change in m (Δm) in each transition must be allowed. So for each step, Δm can be 0, ±1.

Let me outline the possible paths. The first step: 3,0,0 → 2,1, m1. Then, in the second step, 2,1,m1 → 1,0,0.

So for the second transition, m1 must change by -m1, because the final m is 0. So Δm = 0 - m1 = -m1. But Δm can be only 0, ±1. So:

If the first transition takes m to 0, then the second transition would have Δm=0, which is allowed. So that's a possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Another possibility is that the first transition takes m to +1. Then, in the second transition, m must go from +1 to 0, so Δm = -1, which is allowed.

Similarly, if the first transition takes m to -1, then the second transition would need to go from -1 to 0, so Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So all three possibilities for the first transition's m are allowed, leading to three possible paths. But wait, the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the question is about which transition routes are possible and what the probability is.

But looking at the options, let's see. Option A is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3. Option B is 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, but wait, can the first transition go to m=1? Because in the first transition, the initial m is 0. So in the first transition, m can go to -1, 0, +1. So option B's first step is allowed.

Wait, but the second transition in option B would be from m=1 to m=0, which is a Δm of -1, which is allowed. So that's a possible path.

So all three options (m= -1,0,+1 in first transition) are possible. But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, but each dipole transition can be either allowed or forbidden, but in this case, all these transitions are allowed by selection rules. So the next step is to think about the possible transition probabilities.

The probability of each route would depend on the transition dipole moment, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the matrix elements of the dipole operator. Alternatively, I remember that for electric dipole transitions, the probability depends on the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states.

The selection rules are Δl=±1 and Δm=0, ±1. So the first transition must change l from 0 to 1, so that's allowed. The second transition must change l from 1 to 0, which is allowed.

But the question is about the total transition probability through two steps. Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is considered, and the total is the product of the probabilities.

Wait, but the initial state is 3,0,0, and it decays in two steps. Each step is a dipole transition. So each step has a certain probability.

I think the key is to find how many possible paths there are, and each has the same probability, so the total would be the sum of their squares or something.

Wait, but in the options, only certain paths are given. Let me think: for each transition, the probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. So the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m. The dipole operator has components along x, y, z. So the matrix elements are non-zero only for certain m transitions.

Wait, the dipole operator components are proportional to spherical harmonics of order l=1, so their matrix elements connect states with m differing by -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but the transition from m=0 to m=0 is via the z-component of the dipole operator. The transitions to m=+1 and m=-1 are via the x and y components, perhaps?

But wait, the first step is from (n=3, l=0, m=0) to (n'=2, l'=1, m' = -1, 0, +1). So each possible m' can be reached with a certain transition probability.

The dipole transition amplitude from state |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is given by the electric dipole selection rule, and the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

I think that the transition probability for each allowed m' is proportional to certain factors. For l=0 to l=1, the possible transitions are m' = m ±1 and m. So for initial m=0, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Now, the probability for each m' would depend on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. I remember that the transition probabilities for m' are 1/3 each for m'=-1, 0, +1. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think: when l changes from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1. How do the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients look here?

Hmm. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get m=0 would be sqrt(2/3) for m=0, and sqrt(1/3) for m=±1. Or wait, wait. Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta. Wait, in this case, the initial state has l=0, so adding l=1 (from the dipole operator) to l=0. The resulting state can have m ranging from -1 to +1.

Wait, the coefficients are given by:

For example, the state |1, m⟩ can be written as a combination of |l=0, l'=1⟩ states. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the matrix elements of the dipole operator.

The dipole operator has components along x, y, z. So the x-component is proportional to (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}) ) /√2, the y-component is proportional to (Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,-1}) / (i√2), and the z-component is proportional to Y_{1,0}.

So when the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric (l=0), the matrix elements of the dipole operator would connect |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

The matrix element for the x-component would connect to m=+1 and m=-1. The matrix elements for the z-component would connect to m=0.

The probability for each transition would depend on the square of these matrix elements.

Let me consider the matrix elements. The dipole operator is a vector, so it has three components: x, y, z. Each component can cause a transition to a specific m.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The dipole operator in the z-direction (z-component) would cause transitions to |2,1,0⟩. The x and y components would cause transitions to |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩, respectively.

Wait, no. The x-component is proportional to (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}) /√2, so it would change m by +1 and -1. So when you take the matrix element of x with |3,0,0⟩, you get a non-zero value only for |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩? Or wait, no, because the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is s-wave, so when you multiply by Y_{1,1} or Y_{1,-1}, you get terms that can combine to form |2,1, m⟩ states.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the x-component is non-zero for m changing by ±1. So for the transition from m=0 to m=±1.

But the probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element. Each component (x, y, z) contributes to a different m change.

Wait, the transition amplitude from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩ will be proportional to the integral of the product of the initial state, the dipole operator (in some component), and the final state.

The initial wavefunction is Y_00, the dipole operator components are proportional to Y_1m, and the final wavefunction is Y_1m'. So the integral is ∫ Y_00 * Y_1k * Y_1m' dΩ, where k is the component of the dipole operator (like 1 for z, ±1 for x and y).

Wait, but that integral is zero unless the angular momentum addition allows it. For the integral to be non-zero, the sum of the angular momenta must match. So for Y_00 * Y_1k * Y_1m' to be non-zero, the total angular momentum must be conserved.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the selection rules. The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is allowed if m' = m_initial + k, where k is the component (like 0 for z, ±1 for x and y).

Wait, no, that's a bit simplistic. The dipole operator has components that are of order l=1. So when you multiply Y_00 (the initial state) by a dipole component (Y_1m), the product is a function that can have angular momentum up to l=1.

The matrix element for the transition would then be zero unless the final state |2,1,m'⟩ has m' = m (from dipole component) plus the initial m (which is 0). So for example, the dipole's z-component (m=0) would connect to m'=0. The x-component (m=+1 and m=-1) would connect to m'=+1 and m'=-1, respectively.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each component has a certain m value (for the Y_1m function). The matrix element for each component is:

⟨2,1,m' | e r_k | 3,0,0⟩

Where r_k is the k-th component of the dipole operator (k = x, y, z).

The matrix element is non-zero only if m' = m_initial + m_k, where m_initial is 0, and m_k is the m of the dipole component.

Wait, no, because the dipole operator has a certain m. So for the z-component, m is 0, so m' must be 0 + 0 = 0.

For the x-component, which is (Y_1+1 + Y_1-1)/√2, the m values are +1 and -1.

Wait, but when you multiply Y_00 (m=0) by Y_1m, the product will have terms with m=0±m. So for the x-component (which has m=±1), the integral with Y_1m' would be non-zero when m' = 0 ± 1, so m' = ±1.

Wait, perhaps that's the way. So the x and y components can cause m to change by ±1, and the z-component doesn't change m.

Wait, but the dipole operator is a vector, so each component is a different Y_1m. So when you compute the matrix element for the x-component, you get a non-zero value only for m' = +1 and m' = -1, because the x-component has m=±1?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of possible transitions.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition is via a dipole (l=1). So possible final states after the first transition are |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Each of these transitions has a certain probability, and the sum of the probabilities must be 1 for the first step.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components, each contributing to a different m'.

So the probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component.

Assuming that the x and y components contribute equally and the z contributes differently.

Wait, perhaps the probabilities for each m' are the same. No, because the x and y components may have different contributions.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should recall that the transition probabilities from an s-state (l=0) to a p-state (l=1) are equal for the different m' values.

I think that for each dipole transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m' values are -1, 0, +1, and the probabilities for each are the same. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that, but let's proceed under this assumption.

So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ could go to |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1, +1⟩, each with probability 1/3.

Then, the second transition must go from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, for each m', the possible transitions are to m=0. So for the second transition, each |2,1,m'⟩ can go to |1,0,0⟩ only if m' can change by -m' (so Δm = -m').

So for each m', the transition is allowed if Δm is ±1 or 0.

So let's go through each possible m' from the first step.

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,0⟩.

Then, in the second transition, m' can go from 0 to 0. So the transition must have Δm = 0. So the dipole operator component causing this would be the z-component (since m=0), so again, the probability for this transition is 1/3.

So the total probability for this path (3→2,1,0 →1,0,0) would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1, +1⟩.

In the second transition, m' is +1, so to reach m=0, Δm is -1. So the transition is allowed. The probability for this transition is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=+1 to m=0. I think this is 1/3 as well. So the probability for this path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Case3: First transition to |2,1, -1⟩.

In the second step, m' is -1, so to reach m=0, Δm = +1. Allowed, and the probability is again 1/3. So the path's probability is (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9.

So all three paths have a probability of 1/9 each. So the total probability is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

Wait, but the options don't mention all three possibilities. Let me look at the options.

Option A is |3→2,1,0⟩ →1,0,0⟩, with probability 1/3. Wait, but according to my calculation, each individual path has 1/9 probability, and the total for all three is 1/3.

But the options don't include a sum of all three. The options only show one possible route, like option A shows only the path through m=0, with probability 1/3.

Hmm, but wait. What if the first transition has a higher probability for certain m' values?

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption that each m' has equal probability in the first transition. Perhaps the probabilities are not all equal.

Wait, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is via the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components x, y, z, which correspond to different m changes.

The z-component is Y_10, so it would cause m to change by 0. The x-component is proportional to Y_1+1 + Y_1-1, and the y-component is similar but with an imaginary factor.

So for the transition dipole moment, the matrix elements for the x and y components would go into m'=±1, and the z component contributes to m'=0.

The probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which for each component is the same. Because the x and y components have the same magnitude, perhaps the probabilities for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are the same, and each is 1/3, while m'=0 is another 1/3.

Wait, no. Because the x and y components together might contribute to m'=+1 and m'=-1. Let me think in terms of the number of components. The dipole operator has three real components (x, y, z), each contributing to a different m'.

But the transition probabilities for each m' would be the same for m'=+1 and m'=-1, because the x and y components are symmetric in this case.

So perhaps the probability for m'=0 is 1/3, and each of m'=±1 is 1/3 as well. So each of the three paths contributes 1/3 each, but wait, that can't be because three paths each with 1/3 would sum to 1, but the first transition's probabilities must sum to 1.

Wait, perhaps the transition probabilities for the first step are 1/3 each for m'=0, +1, -1.

So each first transition to m' has probability 1/3.

Then, the second transition from m'=0 would have probability 1/3, leading to 1/3 *1/3=1/9.

Wait, but that would make each path have 1/9. So the total for all three paths would be 3*(1/9)=1/3.

So the total probability is 1/3.

Looking back at the options, option A is that route through m'=0, with probability 1/3. But according to this, the total possible probability is 1/3, but the option only gives one path. Maybe the question is asking about the probability for that particular path, not the total.

Wait, the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex)".

So if the correct route is through m'=0, then the probability is 1/3. But according to my previous calculation, the total probability for all possible routes is 1/3, but each individual route is 1/9. So the option with the 1/3 probability would be incorrect, unless the question is only considering a single path.

But the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions, but it doesn't specify that it's the only possible route. So perhaps the correct answer includes all possible routes, but the question is only giving one possible path and the associated probability, which would be the individual path's probability.

Wait, but the options don't present the sum, but individual routes. So for example, option A presents the path through m=0 and gives a probability of 1/3. But according to my calculation, each path (m=0, m=+1, m=-1) has a probability of 1/9, and the total is 1/3. So the option with the 1/3 probability would be the sum, but the options don't have that. Instead, only option A has a 1/3 probability.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So each option gives a particular route and a probability for that route.

So for option A, the route is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3. But according to my earlier calculation, each individual path (like the one in option A) has a probability of 1/9, so the option's probability of 1/3 would be wrong.

Wait, but perhaps my assumption about each m' having equal probability in the first transition is wrong. Maybe the probabilities are not the same.

Wait, let's think about the matrix elements more carefully. The dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each component would contribute to a transition to m' = 0, +1, and -1, respectively.

Wait, no. The z-component (Y_10) would cause a transition to m'=0. The x and y components (which are Y_1+1 and Y_1-1) would cause transitions to m'=+1 and m'=-1.

But the matrix elements for x and y are real and imaginary, respectively, but their magnitudes are the same. So the probabilities for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are the same, each being 1/3. And the probability for m'=0 is 1/3.

Ah, so all three transitions have equal probability, each 1/3. Then, in the second transition, each of these has another 1/3 chance.

Wait, no. Because the second transition from m'=0 would have a certain probability, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. So the sum of all possible paths (three paths) would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But the options don't have an option that sums all three. Each option only shows a single path.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 1/3.

Option B) 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C)3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option D)3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 2/3.

Wait, option D's initial state is written as '⟩' which seems like a typo. Probably a mistake in the option.

So, the question is, which transition route and probability are correct.

I think the correct answer is option A. Because the transition through m'=0 has a probability of 1/3. But according to my calculation, each path has 1/9, so the probability for a specific path is 1/9, but the sum of all three is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the combined transition probabilities, meaning the overall probability for the decay is 1/3, and option A is the correct route, but that doesn't fit because the question states 'the corresponding probability' for that route.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible transition amplitude for each step. Each dipole transition has a certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and the overall amplitude is the product of the two steps' coefficients.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. It decays in two steps: first to |2,1,m>, then to |1,0,0>.

The amplitude for each step is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 is given by:

For example, the coefficient for m=0 is sqrt(2/3) when combining l=0 and l=1, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> has a certain amplitude, and then the second transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has another amplitude.

The transition amplitude for the first step (3,0,0 →2,1,0) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m=0. The CG coefficient for 1,0 from 0,0 and 1,0 is 1.

Wait, no. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining angular momenta:

When adding two angular momenta, the CG coefficients describe how to combine |l1, m1⟩ and |l2, m2⟩ into |L, M⟩.

In the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has l=1. So the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,m> is proportional to the CG coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m.

Wait, the CG coefficient for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m) into l=1, m_total.

Wait, let me think. The state |2,1,m> can be reached from |3,0,0> via the dipole operator, which has l=1.

So the matrix element is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining 0 and 1 to get 1, m.

The CG coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m to get L=1, M=m.

The CG coefficient is given by:

⟨ L=1, M; l2=1, m | l1=0, 0 ⟩.

In this case, M = m.

The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2L +1)/(2l2 +1) ) * something. Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Alternatively, I can recall that these coefficients are zero except when M = m ±0, because l1=0.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for L=1, M=m and l2=1, m is 1 if M=m, and 0 otherwise. Because when combining l1=0 with l2=1, the only possible M is m (since m1=0).

Wait, no, that can't be right because the CG coefficient for L=1, M=1 would require combining l2=1, m=1 with l1=0, m=0. So the CG coefficient is 1 for that case.

Similarly, for M=0, it would be a combination of l2=1, m=0 and l2=1, m=0? No, wait no. Wait, the CG coefficient for L=1, M=0 is given by:

⟨1,0|0,0;1,0⟩ = 1. Because when you combine two states where one has l=0, the only way to get M=0 is to have the other state also have m=0.

Wait, but the dipole operator can have m=1 and m=-1 as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for the dipole operator are as follows:

The dipole operator in the z-direction (z-component) would have matrix elements between |3,0,0> and |2,1,0>, because the z-component has m=0.

The x and y components would have matrix elements with m=+1 and m=-1, respectively.

So the transition probabilities for m=0, m=+1, and m=-1 would each be non-zero.

If I consider that the transition to m=0 has a certain probability, and the transitions to m=+1 and m=-1 have the same probability, then each would contribute 1/3.

But I'm not entirely confident about this.

Assuming that each of the three possible m' values (0, +1, -1) has a probability of 1/3 in the first transition, then for each of these, the second transition has a probability of 1/3.

So each path would have a probability of 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9.

But the options don't have any option that sums all three paths. So perhaps the question is considering only a specific path, and the probability is the individual probability for that path.

But the question says that the state decays via two dipole transitions, but doesn't specify which route. So perhaps the correct answer includes all possible routes, but the options don't reflect that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, with probability 1/3.

But according to my earlier calculation, the probability for this specific path is 1/9, and the total for all three is 1/3. So the option's probability would be 1/3, which is the total for all paths, not for a single path.

So perhaps the question is considering the total probability as the sum, but the route shown is just one possible path. But the options don't mention summing all paths, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules allow only certain m transitions. For example, the first dipole transition can only change m by 0, so the only possible route is through m=0. But that can't be right because the dipole operator can change m by ±1 as well.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), so the transition to a p-state (l=1, m=0) is the only allowed one. But that's not correct because the dipole operator includes x and y components, which change m by ±1.

But wait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has components that can cause m to change by ±1 and 0. So the first transition can go to m'=0, +1, or -1.

So the initial assumption that all three are allowed stands.

But the options don't include an option that sums the three paths. So perhaps the question is considering the probability for the specific transition in option A, and that is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct route is option A, with a probability of 1/3, implying that only that path is possible. But that can't be right because the dipole operator allows for the other m' values as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the transition probabilities. Maybe the transition for m=0 in the first step has a higher probability than the others.

Wait, another approach: the transition probability from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ for dipole transition is given by the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. The dipole operator is a vector, so it's proportional to r (or Y_1m in spherical harmonics).

The matrix element is zero except when the angular momentum selection rules are satisfied. So for the first transition, the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m' | e r |3,0,0⟩|².

The value of this matrix element depends on m'.

I think that the transition probabilities for m' = 0, ±1 are each 1/3, so each path contributes 1/9, and the total is 1/3.

But since the options don't include the sum, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which shows the m=0 route with a probability of 1/3. But then, that would be incorrect because the individual path's probability is 1/9.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition via m=0 as the only possibility, but that's not the case because the dipole operator allows other m' values.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because when the first transition goes to m'=0, the second transition is allowed, and the probability is 1/3.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Another approach is to look for the possible allowed transitions.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It can only transition to states where l=1 in the first step. So from n=3 to n=2, because l can't go from 0 to 1 in a single step if n doesn't change by 1? Wait, no, because n can change by any integer as long as the energy allows. But in hydrogen, the energy levels depend on n, not l. So n can decrease by 1 (like 3→2) or more, but the question says it decays via two transitions, so probably 3→2→1.

So, back to the problem. So each step must change l by ±1.

So the first transition must go to l=1, which is n=2, l=1, m=0, +1, or -1.

The second transition must then go from l=1 to l=0.

Now, the question is which of these m' values in the intermediate state allow the transition to the final state.

The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m=0.

So for each intermediate state:

If the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, then the second transition can go to m=0, which is allowed (Δm=0).

If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩, then the second transition must have Δm = -1, which is allowed.

If the intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩, the second transition must have Δm = +1, which is allowed.

So all three paths are allowed.

Now, the question is about the probability of each path.

I think that the correct approach is to consider that each first transition (m'=0, +1, -1) has a probability proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m:

For m=1: The coefficient is 1. Because to get m=1, you need l=1, m=1, since the initial state is l=0, m=0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=1 to get L=1, M=1 is 1. So the amplitude for going to m'=1 is 1.

Similarly, for m'=0, the CG coefficient is 1. Because to get M=0, you need m2=0, since m1=0.

Wait, no, that can't be right because when combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get L=1, the state for M=0 would be a combination of l2=1, m=0 and l2=1, m=± something? No, wait, no. Adding l1=0 (m=0) and l2=1 (m=0) gives M=0. So the CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the CG coefficient for L=1, M=0 would be the same as combining l=1, m=0 with l=0, m=0, which is just 1.

But that would imply that the transition amplitude for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=1 and m'=-1, it's also 1, which can't be right because the sum of probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients are normalized differently. The CG coefficients are such that the sum of their squares for a given L and M is 1.

For example, for L=1:

The state |1,1⟩ is |1,1⟩.

The state |1,0⟩ is a combination of |1,0⟩.

The state |1,-1⟩ is |1,-1⟩.

Wait, but when combining two angular momenta, perhaps the CG coefficients are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the coupling of two angular momenta.

When you have two angular momenta, say l1 and l2, and you want to combine them to get L, M.

The CG coefficients describe how to express |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩ in terms of |L, M⟩.

In our case, the first angular momentum is l1=0, m1=0. The second is l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So when combining l1=0 and l2=1, the possible L values are 1 and -1, but since L is a non-negative integer, it's 1.

Wait, no, combining l1=0 (which is a singlet) with l2=1 gives L=1.

The state |L=1, M=1⟩ is |l2=1, m=1⟩.

Similarly, |L=1, M=0⟩ is |l2=1, m=0⟩.

And |L=1, M=-1⟩ is |l2=1, m=-1⟩.

So the CG coefficients in this case are all 1, because when l1=0, the state |L=1, M⟩ is simply |l2=1, M⟩.

Wait, that can't be right because the CG coefficients are designed for when you're combining two different angular momenta. In this case, one of them is zero, so the coefficients are indeed 1.

So, the transition amplitude from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩ is proportional to 1 for each m'.

So the probability for each m' is the same, each being 1/3.

Then, the second transition (from m' to 0) would also have a probability of 1/3.

So the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

So the total probability across all three paths is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But the options don't include the sum, so each option is presenting a single path with a specific probability.

Wait, looking again, option A says the probability is 1/3, which would be the sum of all three paths. But the question asks for the corresponding probability of the route, which is a single path.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, with a probability of 1/3, but that would be the sum of all possible paths. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that m' can only be 0, making option A the only possible path.

But I thought the dipole operator allows for m changes of ±1 as well.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Given the options, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but option D's probability is 2/3, which doesn't make sense because the sum of all paths is 1/3.

Wait, another approach. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The possible intermediate states are |2,1, m⟩ where m=−1, 0, +1.

The transition probabilities can be found by considering the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each possible path.

The amplitude for each path is the product of the two transition amplitudes.

So, the amplitude for the path 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0 is:

A = ⟨2,1,0| e r |3,0,0⟩ * ⟨1,0,0| e r |2,1,0⟩.

Each of these matrix elements is proportional to the CG coefficients.

As I thought earlier, each matrix element is 1 for the CG coefficients, so the amplitude for each step is 1.

So the amplitude for the path through m=0 is (1) * (1) = 1. The probability is 1^2 = 1. But that can't be because the sum of all three paths would be 3, which is impossible.

Wait, no, the matrix elements are actually not 1. They are proportional to the electric dipole moment, which is a constant. So the actual matrix elements are constants multiplied by the CG coefficients, which are 1.

But the probabilities are the square of these, which would be proportional to 1, but the sum over all paths must be 1.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition probability is 1/3, so the path in option A has a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, and the sum of all three is 1/3.

But the options don't present this, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, which states a probability of 1/3 for the path through m=0.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the correct answer is option A, but the probability is 1/3 because the two transitions are each 1/√3, so (1/√3)^2 * (1/√3)^2 = 1/9, but the sum is 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But the question gives option A's probability as 1/3, which is the sum of all paths. So maybe the question is incorrect, but perhaps the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Selection Rules and Transition Paths**:  
   - Dipole transitions obey the selection rules:  
     - Δl = ±1 (change in orbital angular momentum).  
     - Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number).  
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) must decay through two transitions to reach the final state |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).  
   - The first transition decreases n from 3 to 2, with l changing from 0 to 1. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,−1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩.  
   - The second transition decreases n from 2 to 1, with l changing from 1 to 0. The final state must have m=0, so the intermediate state's m must change appropriately in the second transition.

2. **Possible Transition Routes**:  
   - From |3,0,0⟩, the first transition can go to |2,1,−1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,+1⟩, depending on the dipole operator's components (x, y, z).  
   - The second transition must bring the system to |1,0,0⟩. For example:  
     - If the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, the second transition can proceed to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = 0).  
     - If the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩, the second transition must have Δm = −1 to reach |1,0,0⟩.  
     - If the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩, the second transition must have Δm = +1 to reach |1,0,0⟩.  
   - All three paths are allowed by the selection rules.

3. **Transition Probabilities**:  
   - The probability of each transition depends on the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator.  
   - For the first transition, the probabilities for m' = −1, 0, +1 are equal, each being 1/3.  
   - For the second transition, the probabilities for m = −1, 0, +1 to reach m=0 are also equal, each being 1/3.  
   - The total probability for each path (e.g., |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9.  
   - The total probability across all three paths is 3 × (1/9) = 1/3.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the total probability for all paths but not the individual path's probability (1/9).  
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the probability for this specific path is 1/9, not 1/4.  
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.  
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the probability for this specific path is 1/9, not 2/3.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - The question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability. While the total probability for all paths is 1/3, the options only provide individual paths.  
   - Option A correctly identifies the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ but assigns a probability of 1/3, which likely represents the total probability rather than the individual path's probability.  
   - Given the options, Option A is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions, right. So I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. I think for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, right? Or wait, is it that m can change by 0 or ±1?

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It needs to decay to |1,0,0⟩ through two steps. So, each step would be a dipole transition. So first, from n=3 to some lower n, then from there to n=1.

Wait, n has to decrease by a certain amount each time. Let me think: each transition can change n by ±1, but in emission (since it's decaying), n decreases. So from 3, the first transition could go to n=2 or maybe lower? But from 3 to 1 in two steps. So 3→2 and then 2→1.

But wait, what about the angular momentum quantum numbers? The initial state has l=0, m=0. So for the first transition, since l can only change by ±1, from l=0, the next l must be 1. So after the first transition, l becomes 1.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m? Because l can't jump more than 1. So from l=0 to l=1. Then, the second transition would go from l=1 to l=0, since we have to end at l=0 in the final state.

So let's think about the possible m changes. For each transition, m can change by -1, 0, +1. So in the first transition, m starts at 0. So possible m after first transition could be -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, it has to go from whatever m was to 0.

Wait, the final state is m=0. So when the second transition happens, from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the m must go from m to 0. So the change in m (Δm) in each transition must be allowed. So for each step, Δm can be 0, ±1.

Let me outline the possible paths. The first step: 3,0,0 → 2,1, m1. Then, in the second step, 2,1,m1 → 1,0,0.

So for the second transition, m1 must change by -m1, because the final m is 0. So Δm = 0 - m1 = -m1. But Δm can be only 0, ±1. So:

If the first transition takes m to 0, then the second transition would have Δm=0, which is allowed. So that's a possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Another possibility is that the first transition takes m to +1. Then, in the second transition, m must go from +1 to 0, so Δm = -1, which is allowed.

Similarly, if the first transition takes m to -1, then the second transition would need to go from -1 to 0, so Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So all three possibilities for the first transition's m are allowed, leading to three possible paths. But wait, the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the question is about which transition routes are possible and what the probability is.

But looking at the options, let's see. Option A is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3. Option B is 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, but wait, can the first transition go to m=1? Because in the first transition, the initial m is 0. So in the first transition, m can go to -1, 0, +1. So option B's first step is allowed.

Wait, but the second transition in option B would be from m=1 to m=0, which is a Δm of -1, which is allowed. So that's a possible path.

So all three options (m= -1,0,+1 in first transition) are possible. But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, but each dipole transition can be either allowed or forbidden, but in this case, all these transitions are allowed by selection rules. So the next step is to think about the possible transition probabilities.

The probability of each route would depend on the transition dipole moment, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the matrix elements of the dipole operator. Alternatively, I remember that for electric dipole transitions, the probability depends on the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states.

The selection rules are Δl=±1 and Δm=0, ±1. So the first transition must change l from 0 to 1, so that's allowed. The second transition must change l from 1 to 0, which is allowed.

But the question is about the total transition probability through two steps. Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is considered, and the total is the product of the probabilities.

Wait, but the initial state is 3,0,0, and it decays in two steps. Each step is a dipole transition. So each step has a certain probability.

I think the key is to find how many possible paths there are, and each has the same probability, so the total would be the sum of their squares or something.

Wait, but in the options, only certain paths are given. Let me think: for each transition, the probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. So the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m. The dipole operator has components along x, y, z. So the matrix elements are non-zero only for certain m transitions.

Wait, the dipole operator components are proportional to spherical harmonics of order l=1, so their matrix elements connect states with m differing by -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but the transition from m=0 to m=0 is via the z-component of the dipole operator. The transitions to m=+1 and m=-1 are via the x and y components, perhaps?

But wait, the first step is from (n=3, l=0, m=0) to (n'=2, l'=1, m' = -1, 0, +1). So each possible m' can be reached with a certain transition probability.

The dipole transition amplitude from state |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is given by the electric dipole selection rule, and the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

I think that the transition probability for each allowed m' is proportional to certain factors. For l=0 to l=1, the possible transitions are m' = m ±1 and m. So for initial m=0, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Now, the probability for each m' would depend on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. I remember that the transition probabilities for m' are 1/3 each for m'=-1, 0, +1. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think: when l changes from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1. How do the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients look here?

Hmm. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get m=0 would be sqrt(2/3) for m=0, and sqrt(1/3) for m=±1. Or wait, wait. Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta. Wait, in this case, the initial state has l=0, so adding l=1 (from the dipole operator) to l=0. The resulting state can have m ranging from -1 to +1.

Wait, the coefficients are given by:

For example, the state |1, m⟩ can be written as a combination of |l=0, l'=1⟩ states. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the matrix elements of the dipole operator.

The dipole operator has components along x, y, z. So the x-component is proportional to (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}) ) /√2, the y-component is proportional to (Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,-1}) / (i√2), and the z-component is proportional to Y_{1,0}.

So when the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric (l=0), the matrix elements of the dipole operator would connect |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

The matrix element for the x-component would connect to m=+1 and m=-1. The matrix elements for the z-component would connect to m=0.

The probability for each transition would depend on the square of these matrix elements.

Let me consider the matrix elements. The dipole operator is a vector, so it has three components: x, y, z. Each component can cause a transition to a specific m.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The dipole operator in the z-direction (z-component) would cause transitions to |2,1,0⟩. The x and y components would cause transitions to |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩, respectively.

Wait, no. The x-component is proportional to (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}) /√2, so it would change m by +1 and -1. So when you take the matrix element of x with |3,0,0⟩, you get a non-zero value only for |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩? Or wait, no, because the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is s-wave, so when you multiply by Y_{1,1} or Y_{1,-1}, you get terms that can combine to form |2,1, m⟩ states.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the x-component is non-zero for m changing by ±1. So for the transition from m=0 to m=±1.

But the probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element. Each component (x, y, z) contributes to a different m change.

Wait, the transition amplitude from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩ will be proportional to the integral of the product of the initial state, the dipole operator (in some component), and the final state.

The initial wavefunction is Y_00, the dipole operator components are proportional to Y_1m, and the final wavefunction is Y_1m'. So the integral is ∫ Y_00 * Y_1k * Y_1m' dΩ, where k is the component of the dipole operator (like 1 for z, ±1 for x and y).

Wait, but that integral is zero unless the angular momentum addition allows it. For the integral to be non-zero, the sum of the angular momenta must match. So for Y_00 * Y_1k * Y_1m' to be non-zero, the total angular momentum must be conserved.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the selection rules. The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is allowed if m' = m_initial + k, where k is the component (like 0 for z, ±1 for x and y).

Wait, no, that's a bit simplistic. The dipole operator has components that are of order l=1. So when you multiply Y_00 (the initial state) by a dipole component (Y_1m), the product is a function that can have angular momentum up to l=1.

The matrix element for the transition would then be zero unless the final state |2,1,m'⟩ has m' = m (from dipole component) plus the initial m (which is 0). So for example, the dipole's z-component (m=0) would connect to m'=0. The x-component (m=+1 and m=-1) would connect to m'=+1 and m'=-1, respectively.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each component has a certain m value (for the Y_1m function). The matrix element for each component is:

⟨2,1,m' | e r_k | 3,0,0⟩

Where r_k is the k-th component of the dipole operator (k = x, y, z).

The matrix element is non-zero only if m' = m_initial + m_k, where m_initial is 0, and m_k is the m of the dipole component.

Wait, no, because the dipole operator has a certain m. So for the z-component, m is 0, so m' must be 0 + 0 = 0.

For the x-component, which is (Y_1+1 + Y_1-1)/√2, the m values are +1 and -1.

Wait, but when you multiply Y_00 (m=0) by Y_1m, the product will have terms with m=0±m. So for the x-component (which has m=±1), the integral with Y_1m' would be non-zero when m' = 0 ± 1, so m' = ±1.

Wait, perhaps that's the way. So the x and y components can cause m to change by ±1, and the z-component doesn't change m.

Wait, but the dipole operator is a vector, so each component is a different Y_1m. So when you compute the matrix element for the x-component, you get a non-zero value only for m' = +1 and m' = -1, because the x-component has m=±1?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of possible transitions.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition is via a dipole (l=1). So possible final states after the first transition are |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Each of these transitions has a certain probability, and the sum of the probabilities must be 1 for the first step.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components, each contributing to a different m'.

So the probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component.

Assuming that the x and y components contribute equally and the z contributes differently.

Wait, perhaps the probabilities for each m' are the same. No, because the x and y components may have different contributions.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should recall that the transition probabilities from an s-state (l=0) to a p-state (l=1) are equal for the different m' values.

I think that for each dipole transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m' values are -1, 0, +1, and the probabilities for each are the same. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that, but let's proceed under this assumption.

So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ could go to |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1, +1⟩, each with probability 1/3.

Then, the second transition must go from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, for each m', the possible transitions are to m=0. So for the second transition, each |2,1,m'⟩ can go to |1,0,0⟩ only if m' can change by -m' (so Δm = -m').

So for each m', the transition is allowed if Δm is ±1 or 0.

So let's go through each possible m' from the first step.

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,0⟩.

Then, in the second transition, m' can go from 0 to 0. So the transition must have Δm = 0. So the dipole operator component causing this would be the z-component (since m=0), so again, the probability for this transition is 1/3.

So the total probability for this path (3→2,1,0 →1,0,0) would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1, +1⟩.

In the second transition, m' is +1, so to reach m=0, Δm is -1. So the transition is allowed. The probability for this transition is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=+1 to m=0. I think this is 1/3 as well. So the probability for this path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Case3: First transition to |2,1, -1⟩.

In the second step, m' is -1, so to reach m=0, Δm = +1. Allowed, and the probability is again 1/3. So the path's probability is (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9.

So all three paths have a probability of 1/9 each. So the total probability is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

Wait, but the options don't mention all three possibilities. Let me look at the options.

Option A is |3→2,1,0⟩ →1,0,0⟩, with probability 1/3. Wait, but according to my calculation, each individual path has 1/9 probability, and the total for all three is 1/3.

But the options don't include a sum of all three. The options only show one possible route, like option A shows only the path through m=0, with probability 1/3.

Hmm, but wait. What if the first transition has a higher probability for certain m' values?

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption that each m' has equal probability in the first transition. Perhaps the probabilities are not all equal.

Wait, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is via the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components x, y, z, which correspond to different m changes.

The z-component is Y_10, so it would cause m to change by 0. The x-component is proportional to Y_1+1 + Y_1-1, and the y-component is similar but with an imaginary factor.

So for the transition dipole moment, the matrix elements for the x and y components would go into m'=±1, and the z component contributes to m'=0.

The probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which for each component is the same. Because the x and y components have the same magnitude, perhaps the probabilities for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are the same, and each is 1/3, while m'=0 is another 1/3.

Wait, no. Because the x and y components together might contribute to m'=+1 and m'=-1. Let me think in terms of the number of components. The dipole operator has three real components (x, y, z), each contributing to a different m'.

But the transition probabilities for each m' would be the same for m'=+1 and m'=-1, because the x and y components are symmetric in this case.

So perhaps the probability for m'=0 is 1/3, and each of m'=±1 is 1/3 as well. So each of the three paths contributes 1/3 each, but wait, that can't be because three paths each with 1/3 would sum to 1, but the first transition's probabilities must sum to 1.

Wait, perhaps the transition probabilities for the first step are 1/3 each for m'=0, +1, -1.

So each first transition to m' has probability 1/3.

Then, the second transition from m'=0 would have probability 1/3, leading to 1/3 *1/3=1/9.

Wait, but that would make each path have 1/9. So the total for all three paths would be 3*(1/9)=1/3.

So the total probability is 1/3.

Looking back at the options, option A is that route through m'=0, with probability 1/3. But according to this, the total possible probability is 1/3, but the option only gives one path. Maybe the question is asking about the probability for that particular path, not the total.

Wait, the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex)".

So if the correct route is through m'=0, then the probability is 1/3. But according to my previous calculation, the total probability for all possible routes is 1/3, but each individual route is 1/9. So the option with the 1/3 probability would be incorrect, unless the question is only considering a single path.

But the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions, but it doesn't specify that it's the only possible route. So perhaps the correct answer includes all possible routes, but the question is only giving one possible path and the associated probability, which would be the individual path's probability.

Wait, but the options don't present the sum, but individual routes. So for example, option A presents the path through m=0 and gives a probability of 1/3. But according to my calculation, each path (m=0, m=+1, m=-1) has a probability of 1/9, and the total is 1/3. So the option with the 1/3 probability would be the sum, but the options don't have that. Instead, only option A has a 1/3 probability.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So each option gives a particular route and a probability for that route.

So for option A, the route is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3. But according to my earlier calculation, each individual path (like the one in option A) has a probability of 1/9, so the option's probability of 1/3 would be wrong.

Wait, but perhaps my assumption about each m' having equal probability in the first transition is wrong. Maybe the probabilities are not the same.

Wait, let's think about the matrix elements more carefully. The dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each component would contribute to a transition to m' = 0, +1, and -1, respectively.

Wait, no. The z-component (Y_10) would cause a transition to m'=0. The x and y components (which are Y_1+1 and Y_1-1) would cause transitions to m'=+1 and m'=-1.

But the matrix elements for x and y are real and imaginary, respectively, but their magnitudes are the same. So the probabilities for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are the same, each being 1/3. And the probability for m'=0 is 1/3.

Ah, so all three transitions have equal probability, each 1/3. Then, in the second transition, each of these has another 1/3 chance.

Wait, no. Because the second transition from m'=0 would have a certain probability, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. So the sum of all possible paths (three paths) would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But the options don't have an option that sums all three. Each option only shows a single path.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 1/3.

Option B) 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C)3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option D)3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 2/3.

Wait, option D's initial state is written as '⟩' which seems like a typo. Probably a mistake in the option.

So, the question is, which transition route and probability are correct.

I think the correct answer is option A. Because the transition through m'=0 has a probability of 1/3. But according to my calculation, each path has 1/9, so the probability for a specific path is 1/9, but the sum of all three is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the combined transition probabilities, meaning the overall probability for the decay is 1/3, and option A is the correct route, but that doesn't fit because the question states 'the corresponding probability' for that route.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible transition amplitude for each step. Each dipole transition has a certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and the overall amplitude is the product of the two steps' coefficients.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. It decays in two steps: first to |2,1,m>, then to |1,0,0>.

The amplitude for each step is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 is given by:

For example, the coefficient for m=0 is sqrt(2/3) when combining l=0 and l=1, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> has a certain amplitude, and then the second transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has another amplitude.

The transition amplitude for the first step (3,0,0 →2,1,0) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m=0. The CG coefficient for 1,0 from 0,0 and 1,0 is 1.

Wait, no. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining angular momenta:

When adding two angular momenta, the CG coefficients describe how to combine |l1, m1⟩ and |l2, m2⟩ into |L, M⟩.

In the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has l=1. So the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,m> is proportional to the CG coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m.

Wait, the CG coefficient for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m) into l=1, m_total.

Wait, let me think. The state |2,1,m> can be reached from |3,0,0> via the dipole operator, which has l=1.

So the matrix element is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining 0 and 1 to get 1, m.

The CG coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m to get L=1, M=m.

The CG coefficient is given by:

⟨ L=1, M; l2=1, m | l1=0, 0 ⟩.

In this case, M = m.

The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2L +1)/(2l2 +1) ) * something. Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Alternatively, I can recall that these coefficients are zero except when M = m ±0, because l1=0.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for L=1, M=m and l2=1, m is 1 if M=m, and 0 otherwise. Because when combining l1=0 with l2=1, the only possible M is m (since m1=0).

Wait, no, that can't be right because the CG coefficient for L=1, M=1 would require combining l2=1, m=1 with l1=0, m=0. So the CG coefficient is 1 for that case.

Similarly, for M=0, it would be a combination of l2=1, m=0 and l2=1, m=0? No, wait no. Wait, the CG coefficient for L=1, M=0 is given by:

⟨1,0|0,0;1,0⟩ = 1. Because when you combine two states where one has l=0, the only way to get M=0 is to have the other state also have m=0.

Wait, but the dipole operator can have m=1 and m=-1 as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for the dipole operator are as follows:

The dipole operator in the z-direction (z-component) would have matrix elements between |3,0,0> and |2,1,0>, because the z-component has m=0.

The x and y components would have matrix elements with m=+1 and m=-1, respectively.

So the transition probabilities for m=0, m=+1, and m=-1 would each be non-zero.

If I consider that the transition to m=0 has a certain probability, and the transitions to m=+1 and m=-1 have the same probability, then each would contribute 1/3.

But I'm not entirely confident about this.

Assuming that each of the three possible m' values (0, +1, -1) has a probability of 1/3 in the first transition, then for each of these, the second transition has a probability of 1/3.

So each path would have a probability of 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9.

But the options don't have any option that sums all three paths. So perhaps the question is considering only a specific path, and the probability is the individual probability for that path.

But the question says that the state decays via two dipole transitions, but doesn't specify which route. So perhaps the correct answer includes all possible routes, but the options don't reflect that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, with probability 1/3.

But according to my earlier calculation, the probability for this specific path is 1/9, and the total for all three is 1/3. So the option's probability would be 1/3, which is the total for all paths, not for a single path.

So perhaps the question is considering the total probability as the sum, but the route shown is just one possible path. But the options don't mention summing all paths, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules allow only certain m transitions. For example, the first dipole transition can only change m by 0, so the only possible route is through m=0. But that can't be right because the dipole operator can change m by ±1 as well.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), so the transition to a p-state (l=1, m=0) is the only allowed one. But that's not correct because the dipole operator includes x and y components, which change m by ±1.

But wait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has components that can cause m to change by ±1 and 0. So the first transition can go to m'=0, +1, or -1.

So the initial assumption that all three are allowed stands.

But the options don't include an option that sums the three paths. So perhaps the question is considering the probability for the specific transition in option A, and that is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct route is option A, with a probability of 1/3, implying that only that path is possible. But that can't be right because the dipole operator allows for the other m' values as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the transition probabilities. Maybe the transition for m=0 in the first step has a higher probability than the others.

Wait, another approach: the transition probability from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ for dipole transition is given by the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. The dipole operator is a vector, so it's proportional to r (or Y_1m in spherical harmonics).

The matrix element is zero except when the angular momentum selection rules are satisfied. So for the first transition, the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m' | e r |3,0,0⟩|².

The value of this matrix element depends on m'.

I think that the transition probabilities for m' = 0, ±1 are each 1/3, so each path contributes 1/9, and the total is 1/3.

But since the options don't include the sum, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which shows the m=0 route with a probability of 1/3. But then, that would be incorrect because the individual path's probability is 1/9.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition via m=0 as the only possibility, but that's not the case because the dipole operator allows other m' values.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because when the first transition goes to m'=0, the second transition is allowed, and the probability is 1/3.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Another approach is to look for the possible allowed transitions.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It can only transition to states where l=1 in the first step. So from n=3 to n=2, because l can't go from 0 to 1 in a single step if n doesn't change by 1? Wait, no, because n can change by any integer as long as the energy allows. But in hydrogen, the energy levels depend on n, not l. So n can decrease by 1 (like 3→2) or more, but the question says it decays via two transitions, so probably 3→2→1.

So, back to the problem. So each step must change l by ±1.

So the first transition must go to l=1, which is n=2, l=1, m=0, +1, or -1.

The second transition must then go from l=1 to l=0.

Now, the question is which of these m' values in the intermediate state allow the transition to the final state.

The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m=0.

So for each intermediate state:

If the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, then the second transition can go to m=0, which is allowed (Δm=0).

If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩, then the second transition must have Δm = -1, which is allowed.

If the intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩, the second transition must have Δm = +1, which is allowed.

So all three paths are allowed.

Now, the question is about the probability of each path.

I think that the correct approach is to consider that each first transition (m'=0, +1, -1) has a probability proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m:

For m=1: The coefficient is 1. Because to get m=1, you need l=1, m=1, since the initial state is l=0, m=0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=1 to get L=1, M=1 is 1. So the amplitude for going to m'=1 is 1.

Similarly, for m'=0, the CG coefficient is 1. Because to get M=0, you need m2=0, since m1=0.

Wait, no, that can't be right because when combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get L=1, the state for M=0 would be a combination of l2=1, m=0 and l2=1, m=± something? No, wait, no. Adding l1=0 (m=0) and l2=1 (m=0) gives M=0. So the CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the CG coefficient for L=1, M=0 would be the same as combining l=1, m=0 with l=0, m=0, which is just 1.

But that would imply that the transition amplitude for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=1 and m'=-1, it's also 1, which can't be right because the sum of probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients are normalized differently. The CG coefficients are such that the sum of their squares for a given L and M is 1.

For example, for L=1:

The state |1,1⟩ is |1,1⟩.

The state |1,0⟩ is a combination of |1,0⟩.

The state |1,-1⟩ is |1,-1⟩.

Wait, but when combining two angular momenta, perhaps the CG coefficients are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the coupling of two angular momenta.

When you have two angular momenta, say l1 and l2, and you want to combine them to get L, M.

The CG coefficients describe how to express |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩ in terms of |L, M⟩.

In our case, the first angular momentum is l1=0, m1=0. The second is l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So when combining l1=0 and l2=1, the possible L values are 1 and -1, but since L is a non-negative integer, it's 1.

Wait, no, combining l1=0 (which is a singlet) with l2=1 gives L=1.

The state |L=1, M=1⟩ is |l2=1, m=1⟩.

Similarly, |L=1, M=0⟩ is |l2=1, m=0⟩.

And |L=1, M=-1⟩ is |l2=1, m=-1⟩.

So the CG coefficients in this case are all 1, because when l1=0, the state |L=1, M⟩ is simply |l2=1, M⟩.

Wait, that can't be right because the CG coefficients are designed for when you're combining two different angular momenta. In this case, one of them is zero, so the coefficients are indeed 1.

So, the transition amplitude from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩ is proportional to 1 for each m'.

So the probability for each m' is the same, each being 1/3.

Then, the second transition (from m' to 0) would also have a probability of 1/3.

So the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

So the total probability across all three paths is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But the options don't include the sum, so each option is presenting a single path with a specific probability.

Wait, looking again, option A says the probability is 1/3, which would be the sum of all three paths. But the question asks for the corresponding probability of the route, which is a single path.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, with a probability of 1/3, but that would be the sum of all possible paths. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that m' can only be 0, making option A the only possible path.

But I thought the dipole operator allows for m changes of ±1 as well.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Given the options, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but option D's probability is 2/3, which doesn't make sense because the sum of all paths is 1/3.

Wait, another approach. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The possible intermediate states are |2,1, m⟩ where m=−1, 0, +1.

The transition probabilities can be found by considering the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each possible path.

The amplitude for each path is the product of the two transition amplitudes.

So, the amplitude for the path 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0 is:

A = ⟨2,1,0| e r |3,0,0⟩ * ⟨1,0,0| e r |2,1,0⟩.

Each of these matrix elements is proportional to the CG coefficients.

As I thought earlier, each matrix element is 1 for the CG coefficients, so the amplitude for each step is 1.

So the amplitude for the path through m=0 is (1) * (1) = 1. The probability is 1^2 = 1. But that can't be because the sum of all three paths would be 3, which is impossible.

Wait, no, the matrix elements are actually not 1. They are proportional to the electric dipole moment, which is a constant. So the actual matrix elements are constants multiplied by the CG coefficients, which are 1.

But the probabilities are the square of these, which would be proportional to 1, but the sum over all paths must be 1.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition probability is 1/3, so the path in option A has a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, and the sum of all three is 1/3.

But the options don't present this, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, which states a probability of 1/3 for the path through m=0.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the correct answer is option A, but the probability is 1/3 because the two transitions are each 1/√3, so (1/√3)^2 * (1/√3)^2 = 1/9, but the sum is 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But the question gives option A's probability as 1/3, which is the sum of all paths. So maybe the question is incorrect, but perhaps the correct answer is option A.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Selection Rules and Transition Paths**:  
   - Dipole transitions obey the selection rules:  
     - Δl = ±1 (change in orbital angular momentum).  
     - Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number).  
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) must decay through two transitions to reach the final state |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).  
   - The first transition decreases n from 3 to 2, with l changing from 0 to 1. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,−1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩.  
   - The second transition decreases n from 2 to 1, with l changing from 1 to 0. The final state must have m=0, so the intermediate state's m must change appropriately in the second transition.

2. **Possible Transition Routes**:  
   - From |3,0,0⟩, the first transition can go to |2,1,−1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,+1⟩, depending on the dipole operator's components (x, y, z).  
   - The second transition must bring the system to |1,0,0⟩. For example:  
     - If the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, the second transition can proceed to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = 0).  
     - If the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩, the second transition must have Δm = −1 to reach |1,0,0⟩.  
     - If the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩, the second transition must have Δm = +1 to reach |1,0,0⟩.  
   - All three paths are allowed by the selection rules.

3. **Transition Probabilities**:  
   - The probability of each transition depends on the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator.  
   - For the first transition, the probabilities for m' = −1, 0, +1 are equal, each being 1/3.  
   - For the second transition, the probabilities for m = −1, 0, +1 to reach m=0 are also equal, each being 1/3.  
   - The total probability for each path (e.g., |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9.  
   - The total probability across all three paths is 3 × (1/9) = 1/3.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the total probability for all paths but not the individual path's probability (1/9).  
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the probability for this specific path is 1/9, not 1/4.  
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.  
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the probability for this specific path is 1/9, not 2/3.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - The question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability. While the total probability for all paths is 1/3, the options only provide individual paths.  
   - Option A correctly identifies the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ but assigns a probability of 1/3, which likely represents the total probability rather than the individual path's probability.  
   - Given the options, Option A is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: A
