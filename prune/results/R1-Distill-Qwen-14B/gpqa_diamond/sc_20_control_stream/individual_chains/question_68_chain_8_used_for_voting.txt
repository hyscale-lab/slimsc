Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle, which I remember is a particle with spin quantum number s=1/2, so its magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component in the z-direction.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, right? But then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field change. Hmm, I think this has to do with how the spin state evolves when the magnetic field direction changes.

Wait, let me think about the setup. Initially, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Z, H_initial becomes proportional to Sz. So the energy levels are quantized, and the spin is either up or down in the Z direction.

But when the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would change. Then, a new magnetic field is applied along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B' where B' is along Y. So H_final = -gamma B (Sx), because the magnetic moment is in the Y direction. Or wait, mu is a vector, so if the field is along Y, the interaction is with Sy? Wait, no, wait. Magnetic moment mu is gamma times the spin component in the field's direction. So if the field is along Y, the term would be mu_y * B_y, and mu is gamma S_y.

Wait, no, mu is the magnetic dipole moment, which is given as mu = gamma S_z. Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, wait, the way the question is phrased: mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu is a vector, and its components are gamma times S_x, S_y, S_z? Or is mu just in the z-direction?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So that would imply mu is a vector whose only component is in the z-direction, since Sz is the z-component of the spin operator. Wait, but that might not be the case. Hmm, perhaps mu is the vector multiplied by gamma, so mu = gamma S, where S is a vector operator with components Sx, Sy, Sz. Then the magnetic moment is a vector quantity. So the interaction energy is mu · B. So when the field is along Z, the energy is mu_z B, which is gamma Sz B.

Wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. That's a bit ambiguous. Because if mu is a vector, then mu = gamma S would be more accurate, but if it's a scalar multiplied by just the z-component, then mu is only in the z-direction. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, initial state: B along Z, mu = gamma S_z. So the energy is mu B = gamma S_z B. So that gives energy levels proportional to S_z, which for spin 1/2, means two possible states: +1/2 and -1/2. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z.

Then, when the field is suddenly turned off and another along Y is turned on, so now the magnetic field is along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Wait, but if the magnetic field is along Y, then the dipole interaction would be mu · B, which would be mu_y B. But if mu is only in the z-direction (as per the initial statement mu = gamma S_z), then mu_y is zero. That can't be right because the interaction would be zero, and there would be no oscillations. But the question states that the average z-component starts oscillating, so the new Hamiltonian must have terms involving S_y or S_x.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the definition of mu. Maybe mu is a vector quantity given by gamma multiplied by the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S. Then, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is gamma S_z, and in the y-direction, it's gamma S_y.

So, when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B. So, H = - mu · B = - (gamma S · B). Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in the initial state, the magnetic field was along Z, so the Hamiltonian was H_initial = - gamma B S_z. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then, when the field is turned off, and another along Y is turned on, the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S, and B is along Y.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state after the change is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue m_s gamma (for spin 1/2, m_s is ±1/2). Let's say the initial state was |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. But wait, in spin 1/2 systems, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>. But in this case, the Hamiltonian after the change is H = - gamma B S_y. So the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H anymore.

The time evolution of the state will be governed by the new Hamiltonian. The average value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z>, will oscillate with time. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy splitting in the new Hamiltonian.

In the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. Let's compute that. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues ± (gamma B ħ / 2 ). The energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. The transition frequency is this energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ ) = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The oscillation frequency of the expectation value is determined by the difference in energies. However, when the system is in a superposition of the eigenstates of H, the expectation value oscillates at the frequency given by the energy difference divided by h-bar.

Wait, let's think again. The energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) * (-1) because H = - gamma B S_y. Wait no: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y: eigenvalues are - gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which are -gamma B ħ/2 and + gamma B ħ/2. So the two energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2 ) * (-1) ? Wait, no, H is - gamma B S_y. So H |s_y> = - gamma B (s_y) |s_y>, where s_y is ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are E = - gamma B ( ± ħ/2 ), so E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). The energy difference between the two is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. The frequency is delta E / h-bar. So delta E = gamma B ħ, so frequency is (gamma B ħ) / (h-bar) )= gamma B (since h-bar is ħ).

Wait, but wait. The oscillation frequency of expectation values is usually determined by the energy splitting in the system. The Rabi frequency is often given as the energy difference divided by h-bar. So Rabi frequency would be (delta E) / ħ = (gamma B * ħ ) / ħ ) = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. Since mu is equal to gamma S, the expectation value of mu_z is gamma <S_z>. So we need to find the time dependence of <S_z> and thus <mu_z>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the time evolution. Let me think about the initial state. The initial state when the field was along Z is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma B S_y.

Expressing |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H. The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, let's call them |+y> and |-y>. So |+y> and |-y> are the eigenstates of S_y with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

The initial state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. Let's compute the coefficients. The state |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), I think. Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), but with some phase factors. Alternatively, perhaps |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

The spin-1/2 matrices: S_x is (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], S_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], S_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

The eigenstates of S_y are the eigenvectors of the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2. Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. Let's find the eigenvectors. For eigenvalue +ħ/2, solving (S_y - (iħ/2)) |v> = 0. Wait, maybe an easier way is to find that the eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) times maybe some phase? Let me compute.

If |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2), then adding |+y> and |-y>, I get [ |+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ] / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.

So |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Hmm, that's correct.

So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Now, under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / ħ ).

Wait, let's write H in terms of S_y. H = - gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). So the time evolution of each eigenstate is:

|+y> → exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( -i (- gamma B ( ħ/2 )) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t (1/2) ) |+y>.

Similarly, |-y> → exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> = exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) |−y> = exp( -i gamma B t (1/2) ) |−y>.

So the time-evolved state |ψ(t)> is [ |+y> exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + |−y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we want to find the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma <S_z>. So <S_z> = gamma^{-1} <mu_z> / gamma?

Wait, no, actually, mu_z is gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So we need to compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me compute this. S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me write |ψ(t> in terms of |+z> and |-z> to compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, let's express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>, which I've already done.

So |ψ(t> is [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |−y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2).

Expressing in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

= [ (|+z> + i |−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - i |−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2).

Multiply the denominators: each term is divided by sqrt(2), and then we have an overall 1/sqrt(2), so overall factor of 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )= 1/2.

So:

( [ (|+z> + i |−z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - i |−z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] ) / 2.

Let me distribute the terms:

= [ |+z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + i |−z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} - i |−z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2.

Grouping terms for |+z> and |−z>:

= [ |+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + |−z> (i e^{i gamma B t/2} - i e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] / 2.

Factor out constants:

= |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t / 2) ) / 2 + |−z> ( 2i sin(gamma B t / 2) ) / 2.

Simplify:

= |+z> cos( gamma B t / 2 ) + |−z> i sin( gamma B t / 2 ).

So the state is |ψ(t> = cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |−z>.

Now, compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t> .

The state |+z> has S_z = ħ/2, and |−z> has S_z = - ħ/2.

So,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t> = [ cos^2 (gamma B t/2 ) ( ħ/2 ) ] + [ i sin(gamma B t/2 ) cos(gamma B t/2 ) (- ħ/2 ) ) ] + [ (−i sin(gamma B t/2 ) cos(gamma B t/2 ) ) ( ħ/2 ) ) ] + [ (i^2) sin^2(gamma B t/2 ) ( - ħ/2 ) ) ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute <S_z> as:

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t> = [ cos(gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 (ħ/2 ) + [ i sin(gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 ( ħ/2 * (-1) ) ) + cross terms.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Compute each component:

|ψ(t> = a |+z> + b |−z>, where a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta), where theta = gamma B t/2.

Then, <S_z> = |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2 ) + (a* b < +z| S_z |-z> + a b* < -z | S_z | +z> )

Wait, but S_z is diagonal, so the cross terms vanish because < +z | S_z | −z> = 0.

So <S_z> = |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2 )

Compute |a|^2 and |b|^2:

a = cos(theta), so |a|^2 = cos^2(theta)
b = i sin(theta), so |b|^2 = sin^2(theta) since |i|=1.

So <S_z> = [cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) ] - [ sin^2(theta) (ħ/2) ].

= (ħ/2)( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ).

Theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Then, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the question states mu = gamma S_z. Wait, no, in the question, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z, which suggests mu is a vector in the z-direction, but that's conflicting with the new Hamiltonian in the y-direction. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement was that mu is equal to gamma times Sz. So mu is a vector whose only component is in the z-direction. So when the field is along y, the interaction is mu · B = mu_z B_y. But B_y is zero except when the field is along y. Wait, no, if the field is along y, then B has components (0, B, 0). And mu is (gamma S_z, 0, 0). So the interaction is mu · B = gamma S_z B in the y-direction? That doesn't make sense because the dot product would be zero. Hmm, that's a problem. Then, if mu is only in the z-direction, and the field is along y, the interaction would be zero, so the energy doesn't change, and there would be no oscillations. But the problem states that the average z-component starts oscillating, implying that the new Hamiltonian is non-zero. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and mu is the vector gamma S. So mu_x = gamma S_x, mu_y = gamma S_y, mu_z = gamma S_z.

Ah, that makes more sense. So, when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B = gamma S_y B, so the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. That way, the energy is non-zero, and the state will evolve.

But that contradicts the initial statement that mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps mu is a vector, and the initial statement is mu = gamma S. So mu has components (gamma S_x, gamma S_y, gamma S_z). So the initial statement might have been a typo, and mu is gamma S. Alternatively, perhaps mu is gamma times the vector S, so mu = gamma S. Thus, the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y.

In that case, the initial analysis holds, and the expectation value of mu_z is gamma <S_z>, which we found to be (gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, but in our previous calculation, <S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ), so <mu_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ). Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma*B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let's check the units. gamma has units of rad/(s·T), I think. B is tesla. So gamma * B has units of rad/s, which is the unit for frequency. So if the oscillation frequency is gamma B, that's correct.

But wait, when I computed <mu_z>, it's gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ). So the cosine has an argument of gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates at frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, where **γ** is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. Initially, the magnetic field **B** is along the +Z direction, and the particle's state is an eigenstate of **S_z**. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes to **H = -γBS_y**, where **S_y** is the spin operator in the Y direction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z**, denoted as **|+z>**, which corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned with the initial magnetic field along Z.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field is switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes **H = -γBS_y**. The eigenstates of **S_y** are **|+y>** and **|-y>**, corresponding to eigenvalues **+ħ/2** and **-ħ/2**, respectively. These eigenstates are superpositions of **|+z>** and **|-z>**:
   - **|+y> = (|+z> + i|-z>)/√2**
   - **|-y> = (|+z> - i|-z>)/√2**

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state **|+z>** is expressed as a superposition of **|+y>** and **|-y>**:
   - **|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2**.

   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The eigenstates **|+y>** and **|-y>** evolve with time factors **exp(iγBt/2)** and **exp(-iγBt/2)**, respectively. Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   - **|ψ(t)> = (|+y> exp(iγBt/2) + |-y> exp(-iγBt/2))/√2**.

4. **Expectation Value of μ_z**: The magnetic moment in the Z direction is given by **μ_z = γS_z**. The expectation value of **S_z** in the state **|ψ(t)>** is computed as:
   - **<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)**.

   Therefore, the expectation value of **μ_z** is:
   - **<μ_z> = γ <S_z> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)**.

5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of **<μ_z>** is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates at a frequency equal to the energy splitting in the system divided by **ħ**. The energy splitting is **2γBħ/2 = γBħ**, so the frequency is:
   - **f = γB**.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is **γB**. This corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle, which I remember is a particle with spin quantum number s=1/2, so its magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component in the z-direction.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, right? But then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field change. Hmm, I think this has to do with how the spin state evolves when the magnetic field direction changes.

Wait, let me think about the setup. Initially, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Z, H_initial becomes proportional to Sz. So the energy levels are quantized, and the spin is either up or down in the Z direction.

But when the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would change. Then, a new magnetic field is applied along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B' where B' is along Y. So H_final = -gamma B (Sx), because the magnetic moment is in the Y direction. Or wait, mu is a vector, so if the field is along Y, the interaction is with Sy? Wait, no, wait. Magnetic moment mu is gamma times the spin component in the field's direction. So if the field is along Y, the term would be mu_y * B_y, and mu is gamma S_y.

Wait, no, mu is the magnetic dipole moment, which is given as mu = gamma S_z. Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, wait, the way the question is phrased: mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu is a vector, and its components are gamma times S_x, S_y, S_z? Or is mu just in the z-direction?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So that would imply mu is a vector whose only component is in the z-direction, since Sz is the z-component of the spin operator. Wait, but that might not be the case. Hmm, perhaps mu is the vector multiplied by gamma, so mu = gamma S, where S is a vector operator with components Sx, Sy, Sz. Then the magnetic moment is a vector quantity. So the interaction energy is mu · B. So when the field is along Z, the energy is mu_z B, which is gamma Sz B.

Wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. That's a bit ambiguous. Because if mu is a vector, then mu = gamma S would be more accurate, but if it's a scalar multiplied by just the z-component, then mu is only in the z-direction. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, initial state: B along Z, mu = gamma S_z. So the energy is mu B = gamma S_z B. So that gives energy levels proportional to S_z, which for spin 1/2, means two possible states: +1/2 and -1/2. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z.

Then, when the field is suddenly turned off and another along Y is turned on, so now the magnetic field is along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Wait, but if the magnetic field is along Y, then the dipole interaction would be mu · B, which would be mu_y B. But if mu is only in the z-direction (as per the initial statement mu = gamma S_z), then mu_y is zero. That can't be right because the interaction would be zero, and there would be no oscillations. But the question states that the average z-component starts oscillating, so the new Hamiltonian must have terms involving S_y or S_x.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the definition of mu. Maybe mu is a vector quantity given by gamma multiplied by the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S. Then, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is gamma S_z, and in the y-direction, it's gamma S_y.

So, when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B. So, H = - mu · B = - (gamma S · B). Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in the initial state, the magnetic field was along Z, so the Hamiltonian was H_initial = - gamma B S_z. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then, when the field is turned off, and another along Y is turned on, the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S, and B is along Y.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state after the change is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue m_s gamma (for spin 1/2, m_s is ±1/2). Let's say the initial state was |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. But wait, in spin 1/2 systems, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>. But in this case, the Hamiltonian after the change is H = - gamma B S_y. So the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H anymore.

The time evolution of the state will be governed by the new Hamiltonian. The average value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z>, will oscillate with time. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy splitting in the new Hamiltonian.

In the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. Let's compute that. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues ± (gamma B ħ / 2 ). The energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. The transition frequency is this energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ ) = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The oscillation frequency of the expectation value is determined by the difference in energies. However, when the system is in a superposition of the eigenstates of H, the expectation value oscillates at the frequency given by the energy difference divided by h-bar.

Wait, let's think again. The energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) * (-1) because H = - gamma B S_y. Wait no: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y: eigenvalues are - gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which are -gamma B ħ/2 and + gamma B ħ/2. So the two energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2 ) * (-1) ? Wait, no, H is - gamma B S_y. So H |s_y> = - gamma B (s_y) |s_y>, where s_y is ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are E = - gamma B ( ± ħ/2 ), so E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). The energy difference between the two is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. The frequency is delta E / h-bar. So delta E = gamma B ħ, so frequency is (gamma B ħ) / (h-bar) )= gamma B (since h-bar is ħ).

Wait, but wait. The oscillation frequency of expectation values is usually determined by the energy splitting in the system. The Rabi frequency is often given as the energy difference divided by h-bar. So Rabi frequency would be (delta E) / ħ = (gamma B * ħ ) / ħ ) = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. Since mu is equal to gamma S, the expectation value of mu_z is gamma <S_z>. So we need to find the time dependence of <S_z> and thus <mu_z>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the time evolution. Let me think about the initial state. The initial state when the field was along Z is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma B S_y.

Expressing |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H. The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, let's call them |+y> and |-y>. So |+y> and |-y> are the eigenstates of S_y with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

The initial state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. Let's compute the coefficients. The state |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), I think. Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), but with some phase factors. Alternatively, perhaps |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

The spin-1/2 matrices: S_x is (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], S_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], S_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

The eigenstates of S_y are the eigenvectors of the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2. Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. Let's find the eigenvectors. For eigenvalue +ħ/2, solving (S_y - (iħ/2)) |v> = 0. Wait, maybe an easier way is to find that the eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) times maybe some phase? Let me compute.

If |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2), then adding |+y> and |-y>, I get [ |+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ] / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.

So |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Hmm, that's correct.

So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Now, under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / ħ ).

Wait, let's write H in terms of S_y. H = - gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). So the time evolution of each eigenstate is:

|+y> → exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( -i (- gamma B ( ħ/2 )) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t (1/2) ) |+y>.

Similarly, |-y> → exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> = exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) |−y> = exp( -i gamma B t (1/2) ) |−y>.

So the time-evolved state |ψ(t)> is [ |+y> exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + |−y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we want to find the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma <S_z>. So <S_z> = gamma^{-1} <mu_z> / gamma?

Wait, no, actually, mu_z is gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So we need to compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me compute this. S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me write |ψ(t> in terms of |+z> and |-z> to compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, let's express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>, which I've already done.

So |ψ(t> is [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |−y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2).

Expressing in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

= [ (|+z> + i |−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - i |−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2).

Multiply the denominators: each term is divided by sqrt(2), and then we have an overall 1/sqrt(2), so overall factor of 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )= 1/2.

So:

( [ (|+z> + i |−z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - i |−z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] ) / 2.

Let me distribute the terms:

= [ |+z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + i |−z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} - i |−z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2.

Grouping terms for |+z> and |−z>:

= [ |+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + |−z> (i e^{i gamma B t/2} - i e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] / 2.

Factor out constants:

= |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t / 2) ) / 2 + |−z> ( 2i sin(gamma B t / 2) ) / 2.

Simplify:

= |+z> cos( gamma B t / 2 ) + |−z> i sin( gamma B t / 2 ).

So the state is |ψ(t> = cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |−z>.

Now, compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t> .

The state |+z> has S_z = ħ/2, and |−z> has S_z = - ħ/2.

So,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t> = [ cos^2 (gamma B t/2 ) ( ħ/2 ) ] + [ i sin(gamma B t/2 ) cos(gamma B t/2 ) (- ħ/2 ) ) ] + [ (−i sin(gamma B t/2 ) cos(gamma B t/2 ) ) ( ħ/2 ) ) ] + [ (i^2) sin^2(gamma B t/2 ) ( - ħ/2 ) ) ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute <S_z> as:

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t> = [ cos(gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 (ħ/2 ) + [ i sin(gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 ( ħ/2 * (-1) ) ) + cross terms.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Compute each component:

|ψ(t> = a |+z> + b |−z>, where a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta), where theta = gamma B t/2.

Then, <S_z> = |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2 ) + (a* b < +z| S_z |-z> + a b* < -z | S_z | +z> )

Wait, but S_z is diagonal, so the cross terms vanish because < +z | S_z | −z> = 0.

So <S_z> = |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2 )

Compute |a|^2 and |b|^2:

a = cos(theta), so |a|^2 = cos^2(theta)
b = i sin(theta), so |b|^2 = sin^2(theta) since |i|=1.

So <S_z> = [cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) ] - [ sin^2(theta) (ħ/2) ].

= (ħ/2)( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ).

Theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Then, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the question states mu = gamma S_z. Wait, no, in the question, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z, which suggests mu is a vector in the z-direction, but that's conflicting with the new Hamiltonian in the y-direction. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement was that mu is equal to gamma times Sz. So mu is a vector whose only component is in the z-direction. So when the field is along y, the interaction is mu · B = mu_z B_y. But B_y is zero except when the field is along y. Wait, no, if the field is along y, then B has components (0, B, 0). And mu is (gamma S_z, 0, 0). So the interaction is mu · B = gamma S_z B in the y-direction? That doesn't make sense because the dot product would be zero. Hmm, that's a problem. Then, if mu is only in the z-direction, and the field is along y, the interaction would be zero, so the energy doesn't change, and there would be no oscillations. But the problem states that the average z-component starts oscillating, implying that the new Hamiltonian is non-zero. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and mu is the vector gamma S. So mu_x = gamma S_x, mu_y = gamma S_y, mu_z = gamma S_z.

Ah, that makes more sense. So, when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B = gamma S_y B, so the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. That way, the energy is non-zero, and the state will evolve.

But that contradicts the initial statement that mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps mu is a vector, and the initial statement is mu = gamma S. So mu has components (gamma S_x, gamma S_y, gamma S_z). So the initial statement might have been a typo, and mu is gamma S. Alternatively, perhaps mu is gamma times the vector S, so mu = gamma S. Thus, the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y.

In that case, the initial analysis holds, and the expectation value of mu_z is gamma <S_z>, which we found to be (gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, but in our previous calculation, <S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ), so <mu_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ). Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma*B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let's check the units. gamma has units of rad/(s·T), I think. B is tesla. So gamma * B has units of rad/s, which is the unit for frequency. So if the oscillation frequency is gamma B, that's correct.

But wait, when I computed <mu_z>, it's gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ). So the cosine has an argument of gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates at frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, where **γ** is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. Initially, the magnetic field **B** is along the +Z direction, and the particle's state is an eigenstate of **S_z**. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes to **H = -γBS_y**, where **S_y** is the spin operator in the Y direction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z**, denoted as **|+z>**, which corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned with the initial magnetic field along Z.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field is switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes **H = -γBS_y**. The eigenstates of **S_y** are **|+y>** and **|-y>**, corresponding to eigenvalues **+ħ/2** and **-ħ/2**, respectively. These eigenstates are superpositions of **|+z>** and **|-z>**:
   - **|+y> = (|+z> + i|-z>)/√2**
   - **|-y> = (|+z> - i|-z>)/√2**

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state **|+z>** is expressed as a superposition of **|+y>** and **|-y>**:
   - **|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2**.

   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The eigenstates **|+y>** and **|-y>** evolve with time factors **exp(iγBt/2)** and **exp(-iγBt/2)**, respectively. Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   - **|ψ(t)> = (|+y> exp(iγBt/2) + |-y> exp(-iγBt/2))/√2**.

4. **Expectation Value of μ_z**: The magnetic moment in the Z direction is given by **μ_z = γS_z**. The expectation value of **S_z** in the state **|ψ(t)>** is computed as:
   - **<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)**.

   Therefore, the expectation value of **μ_z** is:
   - **<μ_z> = γ <S_z> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)**.

5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of **<μ_z>** is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates at a frequency equal to the energy splitting in the system divided by **ħ**. The energy splitting is **2γBħ/2 = γBħ**, so the frequency is:
   - **f = γB**.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is **γB**. This corresponds to option **B**.
