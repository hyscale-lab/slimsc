Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the reaction sequence and identifying each compound.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Since the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, I'm thinking it's more likely propene because cyclopropane tends to undergo different reactions. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would brominate. Bromination in CCl4 is usually an addition reaction, right? So, propene would add bromine across the double bond. So, compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, or maybe 1-bromo-1-propene? No, wait. Propene has a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is probably an elimination reaction. So, elimination of HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you'd get back propene, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If you have a di-substituted dibromide, and you eliminate with a strong base, you lose two equivalents of HBr. So, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) with KOH (alcohol) would lose two HBr to form propene (CH2=CHCH3) again? So compound C would be propene again? Hmm, that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying B.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is cyclopropane. Because cyclopropane is C3H6 and adds bromine differently. When cyclopropane is treated with Br2, it undergoes ring-opening. So, cyclopropane (which is a three-membered ring with all single bonds, but under strain) would react with Br2 in CCl4 to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo ring-opening elimination. So, dibromocyclopropane would lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond, but what would that look like?

Wait, cyclopropane has three carbons in a ring. Adding Br2 would open the ring, giving a vicinal dibromide. Then, treating that with KOH in alcohol would cause elimination. For example, cyclopropane (C3H6) adds Br2 to give 1,2-dibromocyclopropane (C3H4Br2). Then, with KOH, it would eliminate two HBr and form a double bond. But since the starting material is a three-membered ring, elimination would form a larger molecule—probably propene.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So maybe I'm back to propene again. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is cyclopropane, which upon bromination becomes 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate to form propene. So compound C is propene.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Oh, I remember that when alkenes are passed over red-hot iron, they undergo a reaction called dehydrohalogenation or perhaps isomerization? Or wait, maybe it's a catalytic dehydrogenation? Or maybe it's a hydrogenation? No, red hot iron is a catalyst for some reactions. Wait, wait, another thought: propene, when exposed to hot iron, might undergo a reaction to form another compound. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, wait, another possibility: propene may be converted into something else. Maybe it's dehydrogenating to form something else. Or perhaps it's a dihydrogenation—no, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, another thought: when propene is passed over a red-hot iron, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkane and release hydrogen gas. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would lose H2 to form propane and H2 gas. So, D would be propane. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation, but that would require H2 gas, which I don't think is present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The reaction is propene (compound C) passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. Another way: maybe the propene is hydrogenated using iron as a catalyst. But I thought hydrogenation requires H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. But propene is CH2=CHCH3. If you remove a hydrogen from each of two adjacent carbons, you could form an alkyne. Wait, that would require a lot of heat. Let's see: CH2=CHCH3 → when heated with iron, perhaps it loses H2 to form CH≡CCH3. So, D would be 1-propyne (or propyne). Alternatively, maybe it's isomerization. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: when propene is treated with a red-hot iron, it might undergo a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogen present, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thermal decomposition. Or maybe the propene is being dehydrogenated to form an alkene and release hydrogen. No, wait, propene is already an alkene. Maybe it's being converted to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the red hot iron is a catalyst for a reaction like dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogen, that's not applicable. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the initial steps again. Starting with C3H6, which could be propene or cyclopropane. If it's propene, then bromination in CCl4 would add Br2 across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, treating that with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr, giving back propene as compound C. Then, passing that through red-hot iron could be a dehydrogenation reaction to form an alkyne. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) → 1,2-dibromopropane → eliminate to get back propene → then pass over iron to make propyne (CH≡CCH3). So D is propyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with red-hot iron is a hydrogenation, but without H2, that doesn't work. Wait, another thought: the reaction of propene with red-hot iron might be a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogen, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkyne. Let me think: propene has a double bond. If two adjacent hydrogen atoms are removed, perhaps it forms an alkyne. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) → (with heat and Fe) → CH≡CCH3 (propyne). So D is propyne. Then, D is a alkyne.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids—could it be H2SO4 and HNO3, or maybe H2SO4 and another acid? Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, which are used in some nitrating or sulfonating reactions. Or maybe it's H2SO4 and HCl, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that D (propyne) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps in a reaction to form a diacid.

Wait, but propyne is an alkyne. Reactions of alkynes with strong acids... Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the mixture of strong acids is for sulfonation. Sulfuric acid could act as a sulfonating agent. So propyne (CH≡CCH3) might undergo sulfonation. But where? Since it's an alkyne, the sulfonic acid group would probably add to one of the sp-hybridized carbons. So, E would be a sulfonated propyne, like CH2S03H-C≡C-CH3? Wait, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the strong acids are for a different reaction. Maybe it's a hydration reaction. Alkynes are typically hydrated in the presence of H2O and a catalyst to form ketones. But that would require a different condition, like HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts. So, if D is propyne, then under such conditions, it would form acetone (propan-2-one). But the question says a mixture of two strong acids, which might not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which are used in nitration. Propyne might undergo nitration. But where? The alkyne is quite electron-rich, so the nitration could occur at the terminal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is protonated, making it more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But I'm not exactly certain about this step.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diaddition of HX to the alkyne. But that would require HX, not strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl compound. Maybe via oxymercuration or something else, but that usually requires mercury.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the next step. Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl make H2 gas, but what about E? Wait, perhaps E is an acid, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it undergoes a reaction. Alternatively, if E is a sulfonic acid, Fe and HCl might cause some substitution or maybe a reduction.

Wait, perhaps E is a nitrated product. Let's say D (propyne) reacted with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 to form a nitro group. Then E is CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3. Then, when treated with Fe and HCl, it might undergo a reduction. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines. So F would be CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, if E is a ketone, acetone, then reacting with Fe and HCl might not do much. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's think further. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization, but that's for aromatic amines. Alternatively, maybe F is an amine, and nitrous acid converts it into a diazonium salt, which then decomposes to form something else.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of each step again.

Let me try to list all the compounds step by step again.

1. Compound A: C3H6. Possible structures: propene (CH2=CHCH3) or cyclopropane (C3H6).
2. Bromination in CCl4: For propene, adds Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. For cyclopropane, bromine would open the ring to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane.
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: Elimination reaction. For propene's dibromide, elimination would form propene again. For cyclopropane's dibromide, elimination would form propene.
4. Passing through red-hot iron: Could convert propene into propyne (CH≡CCH3) via dehydrogenation.
5. Reacting with two strong acids (maybe H2SO4 and HNO3): Possible nitration of propyne's terminal carbon, making CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3 (though not sure).
6. Reaction with Fe and HCl: Reduction of nitro group to amine, making CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3.
7. F reacts with nitrous acid: If F is an aromatic amine, this would form a diazonium salt. But if F is an aliphatic amine, nitrous acid might cause different reactions, like forming an imine or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction.
8. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about these steps. Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: A is C3H6. Let's assume it's propene because I'm more familiar with that.

Step 2: Bromination in CCl4. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) adds Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).

Step 3: Alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base, so elimination occurs. Since we have a vicinal dibromide (two Br atoms on adjacent carbons), elimination of two HBr would form a double bond. The starting material is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Upon elimination, it would lose two HBr, removing two Br atoms and forming a double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH3 again. So compound C is propene again.

Step 4: Passing through red-hot iron. So propene (C3H6) is passed through a red-hot iron, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. But without H2, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the propene is dehydrogenated to form an alkyne. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) → (with heat and Fe) → CH≡CCH3 (propyne). So D is propyne.

Step 5: Reacting with two strong acids. Let's say the strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3. Propyne (CH≡CCH3) is treated with a mixture. Maybe it's a nitration reaction. The alkyne is electron-rich, so the nitro group could add to the terminal carbon, giving CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3. So E is nitropropyne.

Step 6: E reacts with Fe and HCl. Iron and hydrochloric acid produce H2 and FeCl2. But in the presence of E, which is a nitro compound, this might be a reduction. The nitro group (NO2) could be reduced to an amine (NH2). So F would be CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 7: F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). Nitrous acid is typically used to convert aromatic amines into diazonium salts, which can then undergo substitution reactions. However, F is an aliphatic amine (CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3). Aliphatic amines under nitrous acid can form diazonium salts but these are unstable and tend to decompose. For primary aliphatic amines, the reaction with HNO2 forms N-nitrous compounds which can lead to the loss of the amine group and the formation of an imine or another structure. Alternatively, in acidic conditions, the amine might get protonated, and then react with nitrous acid.

Alternatively, another scenario: perhaps F is a secondary amine, but I don't think so. Wait, F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3—so the amine is on a methyl group attached to the alkyne. So, it's a primary amine. When treated with nitrous acid, primary aliphatic amines form diazonium salts, which are generally unstable and decompose. In acidic conditions, the decomposition of the diazonium salt would result in the loss of N2 and the formation of a carbon with a positive charge, which could then form a carbocation. Depending on the structure, this could lead to various products, like a nitrile, a ketone, or other structures. If the carbocation is at the end of the alkyne, perhaps it could rearrange or form a triple bond somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe F is an alkyne with an amine group, and when treated with nitrous acid, it forms a nitrile. But I'm not sure about that.

Let me think of the product G. If F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3, and it reacts with nitrous acid, perhaps the amine group is converted into a nitrile. So, G would be CH2CN-C≡C-CH3. But I'm not certain.

Step 8: G reacts with NaOH to form H. If G is CH2CN-C≡C-CH3, then NaOH would do what? Nitriles hydrolyze in basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So, the nitrile next to the triple bond would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So, CH2(COOH)-C≡C-CH3. But wait, structure-wise, it's CH2CN → CH2COOH, so the product would be CH2COOH-C≡C-CH3, which is propanoic acid connected to a propyne chain. Hmm, but that structure seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is at the end, so hydrolysis would give CH2(COOH)-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's possible.

Now, looking at the options, each statement needs to be checked for correctness.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
D) C is a flammable gas.

Let's evaluate each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3, which is an alkyne with an amine group. I'm not sure if this is used for making dyes. Alternatively, some dyes are derived from amines or alkynes, but I'm not certain. So I'll need to think more.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is the product of G and NaOH. If G is a nitrile that hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid, then H would be CH2COOH-C≡C-CH3. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) is used as a catalyst in some reactions and can also form complexes. If H is a carboxylic acid, then adding FeCl3 wouldn't necessarily give a yellow color. Unless the structure allows for a color-forming reaction, like a phenol's formation of a complex with FeCl3. But H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't typically form such complexes. So this option might be incorrect. Or maybe H is something else.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The structure is CH3-C≡C-H. The protons on the CH3 group would be a singlet because they're all equivalent and next to a triple bond (no neighboring H's). The terminal H on the alkyne would also be a singlet because it's connected to a carbon with no neighboring H's. So the NMR would show two singlets: one for CH3 and one for the terminal H. So statement C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a gas but not a flammable gas? Wait, propene is a flammable gas. So statement D says it's a flammable gas. So D's statement would be correct.

Wait, but propene is a gas under standard conditions, right? So if C is propene, it's a gas and flammable. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, no. Let me think: propene is a gas, but in the reaction after bromination and elimination, C is propene. So D's statement says "C is a flammable gas." Yes, because propene is a gas and highly flammable. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the incorrect statement. So the incorrect statement is either A, B, or another option.

Let me look again. The options are about the products. So the incorrect statement is one of the options.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a carboxylic acid, then it's not going to give a yellow color. But if H has a phenolic group, then FeCl3 would form a colored complex. Alternatively, if H is something else, perhaps a ketone or another structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product H is a phenol. But how? Because G would have to have a phenol group. But I'm not seeing that in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I went wrong in the reaction steps. Let me try to think differently.

Alternative approach:

1. A is propene (CH2=CHCH3).
2. Bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).
3. Alcoholic KOH: elimination gives propene again (C is propene).
4. Passing through red-hot iron tube: propene is dehydrogenated to propyne (CH≡CCH3), so D is propyne.
5. D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids. Two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3. Propyne undergoes nitration at the terminal carbon, giving CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3 (E).
6. E (CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3) reacts with Fe and HCl. This is a reduction condition. The nitro group is reduced to an amine, giving CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3 (F).
7. F (CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form diazonium salts, which decompose. At room temp, the diazonium salt might lose N2 and form a nitrile. So G would be CH2CN-C≡C-CH3.
8. G (CH2CN-C≡C-CH3) reacts with NaOH. Nitriles hydrolyze in basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So H would be CH2COOH-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's not a correct structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is on the end, so the hydrolysis would yield CH2C(COOH)2? No, wait. The structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3 with a nitrile on CH2. So, the nitrile group is CH2CN. Hydrolysis would turn it into CH2COOH.

Wait, but the structure would be CH2(COOH)-C≡C-CH3. So H is 3-pentynoic acid? Or maybe propanoic acid with a propyne chain.

But how would H react with FeCl3? Well, if H is a carboxylic acid, then adding FeCl3 wouldn't give a yellow color. However, if H had a phenolic group, then FeCl3 would form a colored complex. But in this case, H doesn't have a phenolic group. So B's statement is incorrect because H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3. So option B is the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of H. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in step 5, the reaction isn't nitration but something else. Another possibility is that D (propyne) undergoes hydration in the presence of H2SO4 and another acid, like HgSO4, which is a catalyst for hydration of alkynes to ketones. So E would be acetone (propan-2-one). Then, E (acetone) is treated with Fe and HCl. Acetone is a ketone; in the presence of Fe and HCl, perhaps it doesn't react, making F still acetone. Then F reacts with nitrous acid. But acetone is a ketone; nitrous acid doesn't typically react with ketones. So this path doesn't make sense, so probably the earlier assumption that E is a nitro compound is correct.

So back to H being a carboxylic acid. Therefore, option B is incorrect because H doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So the incorrect statement is option B.

Let's review each option again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3 (propyl amine with an alkyne). I'm not sure if this is used for dyes, but I can't say for certain. Alternatively, maybe F is not involved in dye synthesis, making A incorrect. But I'm not certain.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a carboxylic acid, then this statement is incorrect. So B is the incorrect statement.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The H's on CH3 are all equivalent and next to the triple bond, so they're a singlet. The H on the triple bond (if any) is a singlet. Wait, propyne is CH3-C≡CH. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Propyne is CH≡C-CH3, which has a terminal alkyne. So the structure is CH3-C≡CH. So the H on the terminal C is a singlet (no neighboring H's). The CH3 group has three H's, which are all equivalent and adjacent to the triple bond, so they are a singlet. So the NMR would show two singlets: one for the CH3 and one for the terminal H. So option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option B because H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂BrCHBrCH₃). Reaction with alcoholic KOH eliminates two molecules of HBr, regenerating propene (C), which is a flammable gas. 

When propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (CH≡CCH₃), an alkyne. Propyne (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃), leading to nitration at the terminal carbon, forming nitropropyne (CH₂NO₂-C≡C-CH₃), which is compound E. 

Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, reducing the nitro group to an amine, yielding CH₂NH₂-C≡C-CH₃ (F). This compound reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), forming a diazonium salt that decomposes to produce a nitrile (CH₂CN-C≡C-CH₃), which is compound G. Finally, G reacts with NaOH, hydrolyzing the nitrile group to form CH₂COOH-C≡C-CH₃ (H), a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: F (CH₂NH₂-C≡C-CH₃) is not typically used for the synthesis of dyes. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option B**: H (CH₂COOH-C≡C-CH₃) is a carboxylic acid, which does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D (CH≡CCH₃) has two sets of protons: the terminal H (a singlet) and the CH₃ group (also a singlet). This statement is correct.
- **Option D**: C (CH₂=CHCH₃) is propene, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since only one option can be chosen, **B** is the best answer because H does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color.

ANSWER: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the reaction sequence and identifying each compound.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Since the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, I'm thinking it's more likely propene because cyclopropane tends to undergo different reactions. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would brominate. Bromination in CCl4 is usually an addition reaction, right? So, propene would add bromine across the double bond. So, compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, or maybe 1-bromo-1-propene? No, wait. Propene has a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is probably an elimination reaction. So, elimination of HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you'd get back propene, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If you have a di-substituted dibromide, and you eliminate with a strong base, you lose two equivalents of HBr. So, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) with KOH (alcohol) would lose two HBr to form propene (CH2=CHCH3) again? So compound C would be propene again? Hmm, that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying B.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is cyclopropane. Because cyclopropane is C3H6 and adds bromine differently. When cyclopropane is treated with Br2, it undergoes ring-opening. So, cyclopropane (which is a three-membered ring with all single bonds, but under strain) would react with Br2 in CCl4 to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo ring-opening elimination. So, dibromocyclopropane would lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond, but what would that look like?

Wait, cyclopropane has three carbons in a ring. Adding Br2 would open the ring, giving a vicinal dibromide. Then, treating that with KOH in alcohol would cause elimination. For example, cyclopropane (C3H6) adds Br2 to give 1,2-dibromocyclopropane (C3H4Br2). Then, with KOH, it would eliminate two HBr and form a double bond. But since the starting material is a three-membered ring, elimination would form a larger molecule—probably propene.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So maybe I'm back to propene again. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is cyclopropane, which upon bromination becomes 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate to form propene. So compound C is propene.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Oh, I remember that when alkenes are passed over red-hot iron, they undergo a reaction called dehydrohalogenation or perhaps isomerization? Or wait, maybe it's a catalytic dehydrogenation? Or maybe it's a hydrogenation? No, red hot iron is a catalyst for some reactions. Wait, wait, another thought: propene, when exposed to hot iron, might undergo a reaction to form another compound. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, wait, another possibility: propene may be converted into something else. Maybe it's dehydrogenating to form something else. Or perhaps it's a dihydrogenation—no, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, another thought: when propene is passed over a red-hot iron, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkane and release hydrogen gas. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would lose H2 to form propane and H2 gas. So, D would be propane. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation, but that would require H2 gas, which I don't think is present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The reaction is propene (compound C) passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. Another way: maybe the propene is hydrogenated using iron as a catalyst. But I thought hydrogenation requires H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. But propene is CH2=CHCH3. If you remove a hydrogen from each of two adjacent carbons, you could form an alkyne. Wait, that would require a lot of heat. Let's see: CH2=CHCH3 → when heated with iron, perhaps it loses H2 to form CH≡CCH3. So, D would be 1-propyne (or propyne). Alternatively, maybe it's isomerization. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: when propene is treated with a red-hot iron, it might undergo a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogen present, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thermal decomposition. Or maybe the propene is being dehydrogenated to form an alkene and release hydrogen. No, wait, propene is already an alkene. Maybe it's being converted to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the red hot iron is a catalyst for a reaction like dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogen, that's not applicable. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the initial steps again. Starting with C3H6, which could be propene or cyclopropane. If it's propene, then bromination in CCl4 would add Br2 across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, treating that with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr, giving back propene as compound C. Then, passing that through red-hot iron could be a dehydrogenation reaction to form an alkyne. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) → 1,2-dibromopropane → eliminate to get back propene → then pass over iron to make propyne (CH≡CCH3). So D is propyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with red-hot iron is a hydrogenation, but without H2, that doesn't work. Wait, another thought: the reaction of propene with red-hot iron might be a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogen, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkyne. Let me think: propene has a double bond. If two adjacent hydrogen atoms are removed, perhaps it forms an alkyne. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) → (with heat and Fe) → CH≡CCH3 (propyne). So D is propyne. Then, D is a alkyne.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids—could it be H2SO4 and HNO3, or maybe H2SO4 and another acid? Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, which are used in some nitrating or sulfonating reactions. Or maybe it's H2SO4 and HCl, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that D (propyne) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps in a reaction to form a diacid.

Wait, but propyne is an alkyne. Reactions of alkynes with strong acids... Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the mixture of strong acids is for sulfonation. Sulfuric acid could act as a sulfonating agent. So propyne (CH≡CCH3) might undergo sulfonation. But where? Since it's an alkyne, the sulfonic acid group would probably add to one of the sp-hybridized carbons. So, E would be a sulfonated propyne, like CH2S03H-C≡C-CH3? Wait, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the strong acids are for a different reaction. Maybe it's a hydration reaction. Alkynes are typically hydrated in the presence of H2O and a catalyst to form ketones. But that would require a different condition, like HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts. So, if D is propyne, then under such conditions, it would form acetone (propan-2-one). But the question says a mixture of two strong acids, which might not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which are used in nitration. Propyne might undergo nitration. But where? The alkyne is quite electron-rich, so the nitration could occur at the terminal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is protonated, making it more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But I'm not exactly certain about this step.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diaddition of HX to the alkyne. But that would require HX, not strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl compound. Maybe via oxymercuration or something else, but that usually requires mercury.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the next step. Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl make H2 gas, but what about E? Wait, perhaps E is an acid, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it undergoes a reaction. Alternatively, if E is a sulfonic acid, Fe and HCl might cause some substitution or maybe a reduction.

Wait, perhaps E is a nitrated product. Let's say D (propyne) reacted with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 to form a nitro group. Then E is CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3. Then, when treated with Fe and HCl, it might undergo a reduction. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines. So F would be CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, if E is a ketone, acetone, then reacting with Fe and HCl might not do much. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's think further. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization, but that's for aromatic amines. Alternatively, maybe F is an amine, and nitrous acid converts it into a diazonium salt, which then decomposes to form something else.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of each step again.

Let me try to list all the compounds step by step again.

1. Compound A: C3H6. Possible structures: propene (CH2=CHCH3) or cyclopropane (C3H6).
2. Bromination in CCl4: For propene, adds Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. For cyclopropane, bromine would open the ring to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane.
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: Elimination reaction. For propene's dibromide, elimination would form propene again. For cyclopropane's dibromide, elimination would form propene.
4. Passing through red-hot iron: Could convert propene into propyne (CH≡CCH3) via dehydrogenation.
5. Reacting with two strong acids (maybe H2SO4 and HNO3): Possible nitration of propyne's terminal carbon, making CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3 (though not sure).
6. Reaction with Fe and HCl: Reduction of nitro group to amine, making CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3.
7. F reacts with nitrous acid: If F is an aromatic amine, this would form a diazonium salt. But if F is an aliphatic amine, nitrous acid might cause different reactions, like forming an imine or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction.
8. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about these steps. Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: A is C3H6. Let's assume it's propene because I'm more familiar with that.

Step 2: Bromination in CCl4. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) adds Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).

Step 3: Alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base, so elimination occurs. Since we have a vicinal dibromide (two Br atoms on adjacent carbons), elimination of two HBr would form a double bond. The starting material is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Upon elimination, it would lose two HBr, removing two Br atoms and forming a double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH3 again. So compound C is propene again.

Step 4: Passing through red-hot iron. So propene (C3H6) is passed through a red-hot iron, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. But without H2, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the propene is dehydrogenated to form an alkyne. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) → (with heat and Fe) → CH≡CCH3 (propyne). So D is propyne.

Step 5: Reacting with two strong acids. Let's say the strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3. Propyne (CH≡CCH3) is treated with a mixture. Maybe it's a nitration reaction. The alkyne is electron-rich, so the nitro group could add to the terminal carbon, giving CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3. So E is nitropropyne.

Step 6: E reacts with Fe and HCl. Iron and hydrochloric acid produce H2 and FeCl2. But in the presence of E, which is a nitro compound, this might be a reduction. The nitro group (NO2) could be reduced to an amine (NH2). So F would be CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 7: F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). Nitrous acid is typically used to convert aromatic amines into diazonium salts, which can then undergo substitution reactions. However, F is an aliphatic amine (CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3). Aliphatic amines under nitrous acid can form diazonium salts but these are unstable and tend to decompose. For primary aliphatic amines, the reaction with HNO2 forms N-nitrous compounds which can lead to the loss of the amine group and the formation of an imine or another structure. Alternatively, in acidic conditions, the amine might get protonated, and then react with nitrous acid.

Alternatively, another scenario: perhaps F is a secondary amine, but I don't think so. Wait, F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3—so the amine is on a methyl group attached to the alkyne. So, it's a primary amine. When treated with nitrous acid, primary aliphatic amines form diazonium salts, which are generally unstable and decompose. In acidic conditions, the decomposition of the diazonium salt would result in the loss of N2 and the formation of a carbon with a positive charge, which could then form a carbocation. Depending on the structure, this could lead to various products, like a nitrile, a ketone, or other structures. If the carbocation is at the end of the alkyne, perhaps it could rearrange or form a triple bond somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe F is an alkyne with an amine group, and when treated with nitrous acid, it forms a nitrile. But I'm not sure about that.

Let me think of the product G. If F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3, and it reacts with nitrous acid, perhaps the amine group is converted into a nitrile. So, G would be CH2CN-C≡C-CH3. But I'm not certain.

Step 8: G reacts with NaOH to form H. If G is CH2CN-C≡C-CH3, then NaOH would do what? Nitriles hydrolyze in basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So, the nitrile next to the triple bond would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So, CH2(COOH)-C≡C-CH3. But wait, structure-wise, it's CH2CN → CH2COOH, so the product would be CH2COOH-C≡C-CH3, which is propanoic acid connected to a propyne chain. Hmm, but that structure seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is at the end, so hydrolysis would give CH2(COOH)-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's possible.

Now, looking at the options, each statement needs to be checked for correctness.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
D) C is a flammable gas.

Let's evaluate each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3, which is an alkyne with an amine group. I'm not sure if this is used for making dyes. Alternatively, some dyes are derived from amines or alkynes, but I'm not certain. So I'll need to think more.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is the product of G and NaOH. If G is a nitrile that hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid, then H would be CH2COOH-C≡C-CH3. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) is used as a catalyst in some reactions and can also form complexes. If H is a carboxylic acid, then adding FeCl3 wouldn't necessarily give a yellow color. Unless the structure allows for a color-forming reaction, like a phenol's formation of a complex with FeCl3. But H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't typically form such complexes. So this option might be incorrect. Or maybe H is something else.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The structure is CH3-C≡C-H. The protons on the CH3 group would be a singlet because they're all equivalent and next to a triple bond (no neighboring H's). The terminal H on the alkyne would also be a singlet because it's connected to a carbon with no neighboring H's. So the NMR would show two singlets: one for CH3 and one for the terminal H. So statement C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a gas but not a flammable gas? Wait, propene is a flammable gas. So statement D says it's a flammable gas. So D's statement would be correct.

Wait, but propene is a gas under standard conditions, right? So if C is propene, it's a gas and flammable. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, no. Let me think: propene is a gas, but in the reaction after bromination and elimination, C is propene. So D's statement says "C is a flammable gas." Yes, because propene is a gas and highly flammable. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the incorrect statement. So the incorrect statement is either A, B, or another option.

Let me look again. The options are about the products. So the incorrect statement is one of the options.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a carboxylic acid, then it's not going to give a yellow color. But if H has a phenolic group, then FeCl3 would form a colored complex. Alternatively, if H is something else, perhaps a ketone or another structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product H is a phenol. But how? Because G would have to have a phenol group. But I'm not seeing that in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I went wrong in the reaction steps. Let me try to think differently.

Alternative approach:

1. A is propene (CH2=CHCH3).
2. Bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).
3. Alcoholic KOH: elimination gives propene again (C is propene).
4. Passing through red-hot iron tube: propene is dehydrogenated to propyne (CH≡CCH3), so D is propyne.
5. D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids. Two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3. Propyne undergoes nitration at the terminal carbon, giving CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3 (E).
6. E (CH2NO2-C≡C-CH3) reacts with Fe and HCl. This is a reduction condition. The nitro group is reduced to an amine, giving CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3 (F).
7. F (CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form diazonium salts, which decompose. At room temp, the diazonium salt might lose N2 and form a nitrile. So G would be CH2CN-C≡C-CH3.
8. G (CH2CN-C≡C-CH3) reacts with NaOH. Nitriles hydrolyze in basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So H would be CH2COOH-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's not a correct structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is on the end, so the hydrolysis would yield CH2C(COOH)2? No, wait. The structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3 with a nitrile on CH2. So, the nitrile group is CH2CN. Hydrolysis would turn it into CH2COOH.

Wait, but the structure would be CH2(COOH)-C≡C-CH3. So H is 3-pentynoic acid? Or maybe propanoic acid with a propyne chain.

But how would H react with FeCl3? Well, if H is a carboxylic acid, then adding FeCl3 wouldn't give a yellow color. However, if H had a phenolic group, then FeCl3 would form a colored complex. But in this case, H doesn't have a phenolic group. So B's statement is incorrect because H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3. So option B is the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of H. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in step 5, the reaction isn't nitration but something else. Another possibility is that D (propyne) undergoes hydration in the presence of H2SO4 and another acid, like HgSO4, which is a catalyst for hydration of alkynes to ketones. So E would be acetone (propan-2-one). Then, E (acetone) is treated with Fe and HCl. Acetone is a ketone; in the presence of Fe and HCl, perhaps it doesn't react, making F still acetone. Then F reacts with nitrous acid. But acetone is a ketone; nitrous acid doesn't typically react with ketones. So this path doesn't make sense, so probably the earlier assumption that E is a nitro compound is correct.

So back to H being a carboxylic acid. Therefore, option B is incorrect because H doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So the incorrect statement is option B.

Let's review each option again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH2NH2-C≡C-CH3 (propyl amine with an alkyne). I'm not sure if this is used for dyes, but I can't say for certain. Alternatively, maybe F is not involved in dye synthesis, making A incorrect. But I'm not certain.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a carboxylic acid, then this statement is incorrect. So B is the incorrect statement.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The H's on CH3 are all equivalent and next to the triple bond, so they're a singlet. The H on the triple bond (if any) is a singlet. Wait, propyne is CH3-C≡CH. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Propyne is CH≡C-CH3, which has a terminal alkyne. So the structure is CH3-C≡CH. So the H on the terminal C is a singlet (no neighboring H's). The CH3 group has three H's, which are all equivalent and adjacent to the triple bond, so they are a singlet. So the NMR would show two singlets: one for the CH3 and one for the terminal H. So option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option B because H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂BrCHBrCH₃). Reaction with alcoholic KOH eliminates two molecules of HBr, regenerating propene (C), which is a flammable gas. 

When propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (CH≡CCH₃), an alkyne. Propyne (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃), leading to nitration at the terminal carbon, forming nitropropyne (CH₂NO₂-C≡C-CH₃), which is compound E. 

Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, reducing the nitro group to an amine, yielding CH₂NH₂-C≡C-CH₃ (F). This compound reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), forming a diazonium salt that decomposes to produce a nitrile (CH₂CN-C≡C-CH₃), which is compound G. Finally, G reacts with NaOH, hydrolyzing the nitrile group to form CH₂COOH-C≡C-CH₃ (H), a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: F (CH₂NH₂-C≡C-CH₃) is not typically used for the synthesis of dyes. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option B**: H (CH₂COOH-C≡C-CH₃) is a carboxylic acid, which does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D (CH≡CCH₃) has two sets of protons: the terminal H (a singlet) and the CH₃ group (also a singlet). This statement is correct.
- **Option D**: C (CH₂=CHCH₃) is propene, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since only one option can be chosen, **B** is the best answer because H does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color.

ANSWER: B
