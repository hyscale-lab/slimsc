Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The key part is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, so the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa. So if plx is small, the distance is large.

So the problem says that the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be (d)^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. Oh wait, no: 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5?

Wait, but the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, no, wait. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/(plx)^5), where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, that makes N proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Hmm, so perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Oh right, because the number of stars in a region could depend on the volume, and volume depends on the cube of the radius, but here it's given as varying with parallax in a different way.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. How does that translate into the number of stars per unit distance (like, how many stars you'd expect in a thin shell at distance r)?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the distribution. So the number of stars as a function of distance. Let's model it.

Let's express N in terms of d. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substitute: N ∝ (d)^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, that can't be right because generally, the number of stars in a given volume would depend on the volume, which is proportional to r^3. But this seems to suggest a higher dependence. Hmm, but the question doesn't talk about volume, just the number varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the given relation is N = some function of plx, and we need to relate that to distance.

Wait, the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's about the differential number of stars with distance, like the number per parsec.

Wait, so perhaps the number of stars in a small shell between r and r + dr is proportional to some function of r. Let me model that.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be N(r) dr, where N(r) is the number per unit distance. Now, if the total number N up to distance r is proportional to r^5 (from N ∝ d^5, where d is the distance), then the derivative of N with respect to r would be the number per unit distance. So dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. Suppose that the cumulative number of stars up to a distance r is N(r) = k r^5. Then the number of stars in a small interval dr would be dN = k * 5 r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it differently. N is the number of stars in a region, and it's proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So for a given r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But the question is how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps the differential N with respect to r.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me think about what the options are.

The options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

The question is how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So, they're asking about the rate of change of N with r, perhaps the differential number, or maybe the number density.

Wait, the number of stars in a region depends on the volume. Volume of a spherical shell (at distance r with thickness dr) is 4π r^2 dr. So if the number of stars is proportional to the volume, then N ∝ r^2 dr. So the number per unit volume would be N/(4 π r^2 dr) = constant. But in this problem, N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So for a given r, the number of stars is N = k r^5. So the number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but that's for the number in a shell. Alternatively, perhaps N is the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance. But wait, the problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps it's the number per unit volume, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about it again. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So 1/plx is proportional to distance. So if N varies as (1/plx)^5, that's equivalent to N ∝ (distance)^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question is about the change per unit range of r. So the change in N with r is dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the options don't have r^5 for the number of stars per unit distance. Let me re-express this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how the number of stars in the region varies as a function of distance. So for each additional parsec (unit distance), how many more stars are there. Based on N ∝ r^5, the slope at any point would be dN/dr =5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is increasing as r^4. So option C is r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the functional dependence of N on r, without considering the per unit distance. But the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" suggests that it's the number per unit distance, so the rate of change.

So the answer would be option C, ~r^4.

The question involves determining how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(r\)), we can express the relationship as \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

To find how the number of stars changes per unit distance, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which gives the rate of change of stars with distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \sim r^3 \)**  
**B) \( \sim r^5 \)**  
**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**  
**D) \( \sim r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).
