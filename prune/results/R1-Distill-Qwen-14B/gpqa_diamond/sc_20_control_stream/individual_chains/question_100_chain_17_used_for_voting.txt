Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's a three-carbon alkene or maybe a cyclic compound? Wait, C3H6 could be either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane. But considering the reactions, I think it's more likely an alkene because the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's for alkenes, adding bromine across the double bond.

So, A is propene, C3H6. Then, bromination in CCl4 forms B. Propene plus bromine would add across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, more accurately, the bromine adds to the double bond, making a dibromide. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would make CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, no, propene has three carbons: CH2=CH2 is ethylene, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or maybe it's CH2BrCHBrCH3? Wait, no, when you add Br2 to propene (CH2=CHCH3), you get 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think—propene is CH2=CH2 plus a methyl group. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it becomes CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, adding Br to each, so each gets a Br. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, but that would imply four bonds on the middle carbon. No, wait, no. Wait, the propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would make the two middle carbons each have a Br. So it's CH2BrCHBrCH3. That makes sense because each Br is on a carbon that was part of the double bond.

So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (but wait, the actual name would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, when Br2 adds to CH2=CHCH3, the product is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, that's if the double bond is in the middle. Wait, no—propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds, each Br is added to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. That's 1,2-dibromopropane, right? So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which is E2 elimination. So the reaction would form an alkene. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkyne? Wait, no. Wait, wait. 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr from each Br. Each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to an alkyne. Wait, wait, no. Because each elimination in E2 is removing one H and one Br, so from 1,2-dibromide, you can eliminate two HBr's, leading to a triple bond.

Wait, wait, but think about the structure. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When you treat it with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond. But since there are two Brs adjacent, perhaps two eliminations could occur. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated stepwise.

Wait, but I might be getting confused. Let me think again. Each Br is on adjacent carbons. So the first elimination would remove one Br and form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH2Br. Then, perhaps another elimination would occur, but that would require another Br. Wait, but in the first step, after elimination of one HBr, you have CH2=CHCH2Br. Then, the second Br is on the CH2Br group. Can another E2 happen? The base could abstract a hydrogen from the C adjacent to the Br, leading to another elimination. But wait, after the first elimination, the structure is CH2=CHCH2Br. Now, the Br is on C3. So for another elimination, the H would be abstracted from C2, adjacent to C3. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So for the second elimination, the Br is on C3, and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from C2, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C2 and C3, but that would make CH2=CH2, which is ethylene. Wait, that doesn't make sense because propene only had three carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the initial compound B is 1-bromo-2-bromo propane, which upon treatment with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules, resulting in the formation of propyne (HC≡C-CH3) because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so eliminating both would form a triple bond.

Wait, but propyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2, so the structure is HC≡C-CH3. But wait, in our case, B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, so eliminating two HBr would require removing two Brs and two Hs. So the product C would be CH≡C-CH3, which is 1-propyne. Alternatively, maybe it's propene again, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the first elimination forms 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3), but wait, that's the same as compound A. Hmm, but I think when you have a 1,2-dibromide and you eliminate twice, you can form an alkyne.

So perhaps compound C is propyne, which is an alkyne. So C is HC≡C-CH3.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Red-hot iron is usually used for dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, C is an alkyne. Wait, another thought: passing an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube can cause it to decompose, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Wait, no, iron in the presence of H2 could hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. But wait, there's another possibility. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted to an alkene via a different process.

Wait, but another possibility: when an alkyne is passed over a red-hot iron, it can be dehydrohalogenated again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where the alkyne is hydrogenated. Wait, if C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to propene. So D would be propene again (CH2=CHCH3).

Wait, but wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with a catalyst like iron would typically add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it to a single bond, but under certain conditions, it can stop at the alkene. So if you have propyne (HC≡CCH3) and hydrogenate it over iron, perhaps it becomes propene (CH2=CHCH3). So D is propene.

Then, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric acid, which is a nitrating mixture. So D is propene, which is CH2=CHCH3. If propene undergoes nitration, it would form a nitro compound. But wait, propene is an alkene. The nitration of alkenes typically occurs via an addition mechanism. So the nitronium ion (NO2+) would add across the double bond, forming a di-nitro compound? Or perhaps the reaction is more likely to be an electrophilic addition.

Wait, but propene has a double bond. Reaction with concentrated nitric acid would probably result in the addition of a nitro group across the double bond. So perhaps E would be 1-nitropropane? No, wait, addition would give CH2NO2-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which would make the nitration conditions. So propene would react to form 1-nitropropane, but wait, alkenes typically add nitro groups. Let me think, the addition would be across the double bond. So propene is CH2=CH2 plus CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the nitration would add across the double bond, so the product would be CH2(NO2)-CH2-CH3. That's 2-nitropropane? Or maybe 1-nitropropane.

Wait, but the addition of the nitronium ion would follow anti addition, but perhaps it's more about where the nitro group ends up. Alternatively, perhaps the major product is 1-nitropropane, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the product could be a nitroalkane, but I'm not certain about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not nitration but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, making HCl and possibly some other conditions. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction, but that typically uses a mixture with H2SO4.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. D is propene. Then, reacting with a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3. So, the reaction would be the nitration of propene, leading to the addition of a nitro group across the double bond.

So E would be 2-nitropropane: CH2(NO2)-CH2-CH3.

Then, compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms F. So E is 2-nitropropane. Reaction with Fe and HCl—this sounds like a nitro group being reduced. Iron in HCl is a reducing agent. The nitro group typically gets reduced to an amine. So the nitro group (NO2) would become NH2. So F would be 2-aminopropane, which is CH2NH2CH2CH3, or perhaps the structure is CH3CH2NH2. Wait, no, 2-aminopropane would be CH2CH2NH2CH3? No, wait, propane has three carbons. So 2-aminopropane would be CH2CH(NH2)CH3. Wait, but the structure of 2-nitropropane is CH2NO2-CH2-CH3. So upon reduction, the NO2 becomes NH2, giving CH2NH2-CH2-CH3, which is 2-propanamine, or is it 2-aminopropane.

Wait, but wait—propane has three carbons. So the structure would be CH3-CH(NH2)-CH3. That's 2-aminopropane, also known as isopropylamine.

So F is 2-aminopropane.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization of aromatic amines, but wait, F is a secondary amine. Diazotization usually requires aromatic amines, but maybe in certain conditions, it can form a diazonium salt with aliphatic amines. However, I'm not sure if 2-aminopropane would react with nitrous acid under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction, like forming a nitrosamine, but that's more for aliphatic amines.

Wait, but wait. Diazonium salts are typically formed from aromatic primary amines. For aliphatic amines, especially secondary ones, the reaction with nitrous acid might form a different product. Let me think—when a secondary amine reacts with nitrous acid, especially under cold (0-5°C) and acidic conditions, it can form a diazonium salt. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a nitroso compound. So 2-aminopropane reacting with nitrous acid might form N-nitrosopropane. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: If F is 2-aminopropane, which is a secondary amine, reacting with nitrous acid at low temperature (like 0-5°C) typically leads to the formation of a diazonium salt. But secondary amines can form diazonium salts, but they are less stable than those from primary amines. So, perhaps G is the diazonium salt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the amine into an imine or another compound, but I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think: After F is formed (2-aminopropane), reaction with nitrous acid would typically be diazotization, but since it's a secondary amine, perhaps it forms a different product. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: 2-aminopropane (F) reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium chloride, which then might undergo some decomposition or reaction. But without more info, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's recap: E is 2-nitropropane. F is 2-aminopropane. Then, G is the product of F with nitrous acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of a primary amine from a secondary amine, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps nitrous acid is acting as an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed further and see what happens next, then backtrack if needed.

G reacts with sodium hydroxide to form H. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base. If G is a diazonium salt, then treatment with NaOH might lead to hydrolysis. For example, a diazonium salt can be hydrolyzed to form a carboxylic acid under strong basic conditions. So, if G is the diazonium salt of 2-aminopropane, then H would be the corresponding carboxylic acid.

Wait, but 2-aminopropane is CH3-CH(NH2)-CH3. The diazonium salt would form on the central carbon. So, the hydrolysis would yield CH3-CH(COOH)-CH3, which is 2-propanoic acid, or propanoic acid (since the central carbon is the second position in a three-carbon chain). Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. But in this case, if the structure is CH3-CH(COOH)-CH3, that would be 2-propanoic acid, which is also known as propanoic acid. Wait, actually, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with three carbons: CH3CH2COOH. Wait, but if the central carbon is substituted with COOH, then it's (CH3)2COOH, which is 2-propanoic acid.

Wait, but wait: If F is 2-aminopropane (CH3CH(NH2)CH3), then the diazonium salt would be (CH3)2N+H–N2^–Cl^–. Then, hydrolysis would replace the diazo group with COOH, giving (CH3)2COOH, which is 2-propanoic acid, also known as isobutyric acid. So H would be 2-propanoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different, but let's proceed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is 2-aminopropane, which is isopropylamine. Is isopropylamine used in dye synthesis? I'm not sure, but primary amines are more commonly used in dyeing. Isopropylamine is a secondary amine, which might have different reactivity. So I'm not sure about this.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid. Ferric chloride is FeCl3; adding it to a solution of a phenol would give a red-brown color due to the formation of a complex. But 2-propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't have a phenolic OH group. So it wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Wait, no—wait, some carboxylic acids can form colored complexes with FeCl3, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if H were a phenol, then it would give a color. Since H is a carboxylic acid, perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). The NMR of propene would have certain signals. Let's think: in propene, the two CH2 groups are on either end of the double bond. The left CH2 (CH2=) would have two protons, and the right CH3 (CH2=CH-) would have three protons. The CH2 group would be split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2, but wait, in propene, each end is CH2 and CH3. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CHCH3.

The protons on the CH2 group (left) would couple with the CH group (middle). The middle CH has two protons (since it's CH2=CH-CH3), no, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH2-CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the left side is CH2, the middle is CH, and the right is CH3.

The left CH2 (CH2=) has two equivalent protons. The middle CH (CH2=CH-) has two protons? No, wait, in propene, the middle carbon is CH, attached to two CH2 groups. No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Let me think again. The structure is:

CH2=CH-CH3.

So, the left CH2 group has two protons, the middle CH has two protons (since it's CH2=CH-), and the right CH3 has three protons.

Wait, no. Wait, in CH2=CHCH3, the middle carbon is CH2? No, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so Carbon 1 is CH2, double bonded to Carbon 2, which is CH, which is connected to CH3. So Carbon 1: CH2, Carbon 2: CH, Carbon 3: CH3.

So the protons on Carbon 1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond. These protons are on a CH2 group and would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH group (which has two protons). But wait, the CH group has only one proton if it's CH, right? No, wait, the middle carbon is CH, connected to the CH2 and the CH3. So the middle carbon has only one proton. Let me think:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH3.

So the protons on Carbon 1 (CH2=) would be adjacent to the CH group (Carbon 2), which has one proton.

Wait, that's getting confusing. Let me think of it as:

Structure: CH2=CHCH3.

So, the left CH2 is attached to the double bond, and the middle CH is part of the double bond.

The CH2 group (left) has two protons, the CH (middle) has two protons? No, wait, the middle CH is actually CH2 when double bonded. No, wait, in a double bond, each carbon can only have one other bond. So Carbon 2 is CH, bonded to Carbon 1 (CH2), Carbon 3 (CH3), and the double bond.

So the CH group (Carbon 2) has one proton. So in the NMR, the CH2 (left) protons would be split by the CH (middle) proton. Since the CH has only one proton, the CH2 protons would be a quartet? Or perhaps a doublet, but wait, the coupling would lead to a doublet of doublets if there's coupling on both sides. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 protons are split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH's single proton.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR of propene.

In propene, the CH2 group (left) has two equivalent protons. The CH (middle) has two protons? No, wait, no. Wait, in propene, each CH2 group on either end has two protons, but the middle is a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Propene is CH2=CH2 + CH3, making it CH2=CHCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is a CH3.

So, the protons on C1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond. These would be a set of protons that are equivalent. They are adjacent to the C2 which is a CH. The CH on C2 has two protons (wait, no, because it's CH, so only one proton). So, the C1 CH2 protons would couple with the C2 CH proton, resulting in a doublet. The C2 CH proton would couple with the C1 CH2 protons, leading to a triplet. And the C3 CH3 protons would be a singlet because they're not adjacent to any other protons on the same carbon.

Wait, no, C3 is CH3, so their protons are all equivalent and not split by any adjacent non-equivalent protons. So in the NMR, the C3 protons would be a singlet.

The C1 CH2 protons would be split by the C2 CH proton. Since the C2 has one proton, the C1 CH2 would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2, so 3 peaks). Or wait, wait: the number of neighboring protons is 1 (from C2), so each of the two protons in C1 would split into a doublet. But because they are equivalent, the splitting would lead to a triplet for the C1 CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the C1 CH2 is adjacent to a CH (C2) that has one proton. So each proton in C1's CH2 group is split by the C2's single proton into a doublet. But the two protons in C1's CH2 are equivalent, so their splitting would lead to a doublet. Similarly, the C2 CH proton is split by the C1's two protons into a triplet.

So in the 1H NMR, we would see:

- C1 CH2: triplet (integral 2H)
- C2 CH: triplet (integral 1H)
- C3 CH3: singlet (integral 3H)

Wait, but wait, the C2 CH has one proton, and it's adjacent to C1's two protons, so it would split into a triplet. But wait, in reality, in propene, the C2 CH has two protons? No, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH3, so C2 is CH, so only one proton. So the C2 proton would be a triplet because it's next to C1's two protons. The C1's protons would be a doublet because they're next to one proton. But wait, that's not possible because the C1 has two protons, each adjacent to one proton in C2. So the C1's two protons would each split into a doublet, but since they're equivalent, the total would be a doublet.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me look up the NMR of propene. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I remember that propene has a triplet for the CH2 group and a triplet for the CH group. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is different.

Alternatively, considering that the double bond causes the CH2 and CH groups to be deshielded but more importantly, the coupling between the protons across the double bond. Wait, in propene, the protons on the CH2 are trans to the CH3 on the same carbon. So maybe there's coupling between the CH2 protons and the CH3 protons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons are a triplet, the CH proton is a triplet, and the CH3 is a singlet. So in total, the NMR would show three signals: triplet (2H), triplet (1H), and singlet (3H). But the question says that D (which is propene) gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. That's not correct because the CH2 and CH would have more splitting.

So, looking back at option C: "C gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra." Wait, no. Option C says D gives two singlets. D is propene. If propene's NMR has triplet, triplet, and singlet, then option C is incorrect. So perhaps option C is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me re-examine. I thought D is propene. If D is propene, and its NMR has three signals (CH2 triplet, CH triplet, CH3 singlet), then option C, which says D gives two singlets, is incorrect. So option C is an incorrect statement.

Now, looking at the other options.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is an alkyne. Alkynes are gases under certain conditions, but propyne (HC≡CCH3) is a liquid or gas depending on the conditions. Wait, but wait, propyne, also known as methylacetylene, is a gas at room temperature. So if C is propyne, then D is propene. So yes, C is a gas, and since it's an alkyne, it's flammable. So option D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be option C because D (propene) doesn't give two singlets in its NMR; it has multiple signals.

Wait, but in the earlier steps, I thought C is propyne. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier steps: A is propene (C3H6). B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. The reaction would be dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr molecules to form an alkyne. So C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), which is a gas. Then, C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, possibly hydrogenating it to propene (D). So D is propene.

So, D's NMR would have the triplet (CH2), triplet (CH), and singlet (CH3), making three signals. So option C says D gives two singlets, which is incorrect. Because in D's NMR, only the CH3 would be a singlet; the other groups would have split signals. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a reddish-brown precipitate. 2-propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a phenol, so it wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B is incorrect. Wait, but I thought H is a carboxylic acid, so option B's statement is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought option C is incorrect, but now I'm considering option B.

Wait, what's the color? If H is a phenolic compound, FeCl3 would give a reddish-brown color. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it would form a different complex. Alternatively, some carboxylic acids can form colored complexes with FeCl3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is something else.

Wait, let me think again about the steps leading to H. F is 2-aminopropane, reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If G is a diazonium salt, then H would be the corresponding carboxylic acid. So H is 2-propanoic acid (CH3)2COOH. So, when you add FeCl3 to 2-propanoic acid, would it form a precipitate? I don't think so because 2-propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So option B's statement is incorrect because H wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C is incorrect because D's NMR has three signals, not two singlets. So now I'm a bit confused.

Let me summarize:

Option C claims that D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). The NMR would have:

- CH2 (left): triplet (coupled with CH)
- CH (middle): triplet (coupled with CH2)
- CH3 (right): singlet.

So three signals, not two. So option C is incorrect.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is 2-propanoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. FeCl3 reacts with phenols, not carboxylic acids, so option B's statement is incorrect.

Wait, but which is the incorrect statement in the question? The question asks for the incorrect statement about the products.

So both options B and C may have incorrect statements, but let me think again.

Wait, the question asks for the incorrect statement about the products. So I need to determine which option is incorrect.

If option C says D gives two singlets, but D's NMR has three signals, then option C is incorrect.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. Since H is a carboxylic acid, it doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a color, so option B is incorrect.

So which option is incorrect as per the problem?

The problem states that the options are about the products, and I need to find the incorrect statement.

So, the options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

I've determined that option C is incorrect because D's NMR has three signals, not two. Option B is incorrect because H is a carboxylic acid and doesn't react with FeCl3 to form a color.

But wait, the options can't both be incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D. Let me re-examine the reaction steps again.

A is C3H6: propene.

B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Reacts with alcoholic KOH: dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr, forming an alkyne. So C is propyne.

D is formed by passing C (propyne) through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron with propyne would likely hydrogenate it to propene. So D is propene.

So, D's NMR has three signals: triplet, triplet, singlet.

Option C says two singlets. So C is incorrect.

H is 2-propanoic acid. Reaction with FeCl3: since it's a carboxylic acid, it might not react. So option B's statement is incorrect. So both B and C are incorrect? But the options are structured so that only one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction leading to H. Let me re-examine.

F is 2-aminopropane.

Reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G.

Then G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is a primary amine, then G would be a diazonium salt. But F is 2-aminopropane, which is a secondary amine. Diazonium salts from secondary amines are less common, but perhaps under certain conditions, they can form. Then, when G is treated with NaOH, it would hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid.

So H is 2-propanoic acid.

So option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. But H is a carboxylic acid, so no, option B is incorrect.

Thus, the incorrect statement is either B or C.

But the problem says only one option is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is incorrect.

So, let's see:

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propene, which has three signals. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a color. So option B is incorrect.

So both B and C are incorrect? But the question asks to choose one incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the reaction where C is treated with Fe and HCl to form F, I got the structure wrong.

Let me re-examine that step.

E is 2-nitropropane: CH2NO2-CH2-CH3.

Reaction with Fe and HCl: nitro group is reduced to amine. So E is CH2NO2CH2CH3 → F is CH2NH2CH2CH3. So F is 2-aminopropane.

But wait, is 2-aminopropane a primary or secondary amine? It's a secondary amine because the NH2 is attached to a carbon connected to two other carbons.

So F is a secondary amine. When a secondary amine reacts with nitrous acid, it can form a diazonium salt, but these are less stable. So G would be the diazonium salt.

Then, G reacts with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids. So if G is (CH3)2N+H–N2Cl^-, then hydrolysis would yield (CH3)2COOH, which is 2-propanoic acid (H is 2-propanoic acid).

So, H is 2-propanoic acid.

Thus, option B's statement is incorrect because H is a carboxylic acid and not a phenol, so it doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color.

But the problem is, the question states that all statements except one are correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D.

Wait, perhaps D is not propene. Let me think again.

When C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to propene. So D is propene.

But another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't think so because C is an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is used for a different reaction. Another possibility is that the alkyne is converted to an alkene via a different mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is decomposed upon heating with iron to form ethylene and something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is used for catalytic dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. Propyne decomposes upon heating to form acetylene and other products, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to an alkane. If so, D would be propane.

Wait, if C is propyne, and it's hydrogenated with iron as a catalyst to form propane (CH3CH2CH3), then D is propane.

If D is propane, then its NMR would show only one signal: a singlet for the three CH3 groups. So option C: D gives two singlets. No, that's not possible. So option C would be incorrect.

But in this scenario, D is propane, which is a singlet in NMR. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is propane, then option C is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought D was propene. So which is correct?

Wait, the reaction of propyne with a red-hot iron. I'm a bit uncertain about this step.

Propyne (HC≡CCH3) is an alkyne. When passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated. Iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so in the presence of H2, it would add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting the alkyne to an alkene (propene) or an alkane (propane).

Without H2, perhaps it's not a hydrogenation. Another possibility is that the alkyne decomposes upon heating. Let me think: alkynes can undergo various thermal decompositions, such as forming acetylene and other products, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to an alkene via a different mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne remains as is, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed with D being propane, but I'm not confident.

If D is propane, then its NMR would be a singlet (only CH3 groups), so option C says D gives two singlets, which is incorrect. So option C would be incorrect.

But then, earlier steps would require C to be propyne and D to be propane. Let me think again: propyne (HC≡CCH3) upon passing through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps in the presence of hydrogen, would hydrogenate to propane.

In that case, D is propane.

Thus, D's NMR would be a singlet (three CH3 groups), so option C says D gives two singlets, which is incorrect.

So, whether D is propene or propane, option C is incorrect because propene's NMR has three signals, not two, and propane's NMR has one singlet.

Thus, option C is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought option B was also incorrect, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let's re-examine.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a colored complex. Carboxylic acids don't do that. So option B is incorrect.

So both options B and C are incorrect. But the problem states that only one option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of H. Let me think again.

If F is 2-aminopropane, and it's treated with nitrous acid, perhaps it doesn't form a diazonium salt but instead undergoes another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: 2-aminopropane (secondary amine) reacts with nitrous acid to form N-nitrosopropane. Then, when treated with NaOH, perhaps it doesn't form a carboxylic acid but something else.

Alternatively, maybe F is a primary amine. Wait, no, F is 2-aminopropane, which is a secondary amine.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of F with nitrous acid doesn't form a diazonium salt but instead forms an amine oxide.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of E.

Wait, let me think again. E is the product of D (propene) reacting with two strong acids. If the two acids are concentrated sulfuric and nitric, then E would be the nitration product. So nitration of propene (an alkene) would add a nitro group across the double bond. The product would be 1-nitropropane (if the addition is to the first carbon), or 2-nitropropane.

But in the nitration of propene, the nitro group would add across the double bond, giving 1-nitropropane (CH2NO2CH2CH3) or 2-nitropropane (CH3CHNO2CH3). Wait, no, the addition would be in a way that the nitro group adds to the less substituted position. Wait, in propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding NO2+ across the double bond would lead to CH2NO2-CH2-CH3 (1-nitropropane) or CH3-CHNO2-CH3 (2-nitropropane). Which is more likely? The addition would likely follow Markovnikov's rule, but for nitration, it's more about the stability of the intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs via a cyclic intermediate, leading to the most stable product. But I'm not certain.

If E is 2-nitropropane, then F would be 2-aminopropane upon reduction. Then, G would be the diazonium salt, and H would be 2-propanoic acid.

Alternatively, if E is 1-nitropropane, then F would be 1-aminopropane (CH2NH2CH2CH3). Then, when treated with nitrous acid, it would form a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis would form propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), which is different from before.

But regardless, H would be a carboxylic acid and wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B's statement is incorrect.

Thus, the incorrect statement is either B or C.

But the problem specifies only one incorrect option.

Perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

If D is propene, which has three signals, then option C is incorrect.

If D is propane, which has one singlet, then option C is incorrect.

So regardless, option C is incorrect.

Option B is also incorrect, but perhaps I made a mistake in F's structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps F is 1-aminopropane (primary amine), which when treated with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt, and upon hydrolysis would form propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), which is a different structure.

But in that case, H would be propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. Then, H's structure is CH2CH2COOH, which is a three-carbon carboxylic acid.

But regardless, H is a carboxylic acid, so option B's statement remains incorrect.

Given all this, I think the incorrect statements are both B and C, but since the question expects one, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the structure of D.

Alternative approach: Let me go step by step again.

1. A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3).

2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

3. React with alcoholic KOH: E2 elimination, removes two HBr → forms propyne (CH≡CCH3).

4. Propyne (C) passed through red-hot iron: likely hydrogenated to propane (CH3CH2CH3) if fully hydrogenated, or propene (CH2=CHCH3) if partially hydrogenated.

Assuming partial hydrogenation, D is propene.

5. D (propene) reacts with two strong acids (likely H2SO4 and HNO3) → nitration adds NO2 group across double bond. Product E is 1-nitropropane or 2-nitropropane.

6. E treated with Fe and HCl → reduces nitro group to amine. If E is 2-nitropropane, F is 2-aminopropane.

7. F reacts with nitrous acid → forms diazonium salt (G).

8. G treated with NaOH → hydrolyzes to carboxylic acid (H is 2-propanoic acid: (CH3)2COOH).

So H is 2-propanoic acid.

Now, looking at the options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is 2-aminopropane (secondary amine). Are secondary amines used in dye synthesis? I'm not sure. Dyes often use primary amines, but perhaps some use secondary. I'm not certain if this is correct.

B) H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, so incorrect.

C) D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propene, which has three signals, so incorrect.

D) C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is a gas, so correct.

So options B and C are incorrect. The question asks for the incorrect statement. But only one option can be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the NMR analysis of D.

If D is propene (CH2=CHCH3), the NMR would have:

- The CH2 group (left) as a triplet (integral 2H)
- The CH group (middle) as a triplet (integral 1H)
- The CH3 group (right) as a singlet (integral 3H)

So three signals. So option C, which says D gives two singlets, is incorrect.

Option B, H is a carboxylic acid and doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B's statement is incorrect.

Thus, both B and C are incorrect. But the problem states that only one is incorrect. So perhaps one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of H.

Wait, perhaps when F (2-aminopropane) reacts with nitrous acid, it forms a different product.

Another possibility: F is 2-aminopropane, which reacts with nitrous acid to form N-nitrosopropane (an N-nitrosamine). Then, when treated with NaOH, perhaps it doesn't form a carboxylic acid but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is formed, but it's unstable and decomposes. Diazonium salts of secondary amines are less stable, so perhaps they decompose to form an imine or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of F with nitrous acid doesn't proceed, making G the same as F. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form something else.

But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of F with nitrous acid is an oxidation, forming a hydroxylamine or something else.

But given the time I've spent, I think the key incorrect statements are B and C.

But according to the options, only one is incorrect. So perhaps I should focus on the options again.

The question is, which statement is incorrect.

If I have to choose between B and C, perhaps I should think about which one is more definitely incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids don't react with FeCl3 to give a color. So option B is definitely incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. D is propene, which has three signals, so option C is incorrect.

Thus, both B and C are incorrect. But the question says only one is incorrect. Hmm.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D.

Wait, another possibility: when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's dehydrohalogenated again to form something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is used for the dehydrogenation of the alkyne to form an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of propyne with iron and HCl forms a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is propyne, and D is acetylene (ethyne), which is even more unsaturated. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps D isn't propene but something else.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I think the incorrect statements are B and C. But since the question expects one, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, the question says which statement is incorrect about the products. So, perhaps option C is incorrect because propene's NMR has three signals, not two.

Thus, the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃) as compound B. Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two equivalents of HBr to form an alkyne, propyne (HC≡C-CH₃), as compound C. 

When propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes catalytic hydrogenation to form propene (CH₂=CH-CH₃) as compound D. Reaction of D with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃) results in nitration, where a nitro group adds across the double bond, forming 1-nitropropane or 2-nitropropane as compound E. Reduction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid converts the nitro group to an amine, yielding 2-aminopropane (CH₃-CH(NH₂)-CH₃) as compound F. 

Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms a diazonium salt (G), which upon treatment with sodium hydroxide hydrolyzes to form 2-propanoic acid (CH₃-CH(COOH)-CH₃) as compound H.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.  
   F is 2-aminopropane, a secondary amine. While primary amines are more commonly used in dye synthesis, secondary amines like 2-aminopropane can also participate in dye formation. This statement is plausible.

2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.  
   H is 2-propanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a reddish-brown precipitate, but it does not react with carboxylic acids to give a yellow color. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.  
   D is propene (CH₂=CH-CH₃). Its ¹H NMR spectrum shows three signals: a triplet for the CH₂ group (2H), a triplet for the CH group (1H), and a singlet for the CH₃ group (3H). Therefore, D does not give two singlets, making this statement incorrect.

4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas.  
   C is propyne (HC≡C-CH₃), which is a gas at room temperature and highly flammable. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options B and C are incorrect. However, since the question specifies identifying the incorrect statement, and option B explicitly contradicts the chemical nature of H, it is the best choice for the incorrect statement.

**Answer: B**

Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's a three-carbon alkene or maybe a cyclic compound? Wait, C3H6 could be either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane. But considering the reactions, I think it's more likely an alkene because the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's for alkenes, adding bromine across the double bond.

So, A is propene, C3H6. Then, bromination in CCl4 forms B. Propene plus bromine would add across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, more accurately, the bromine adds to the double bond, making a dibromide. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would make CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, no, propene has three carbons: CH2=CH2 is ethylene, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or maybe it's CH2BrCHBrCH3? Wait, no, when you add Br2 to propene (CH2=CHCH3), you get 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think—propene is CH2=CH2 plus a methyl group. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it becomes CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, adding Br to each, so each gets a Br. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, but that would imply four bonds on the middle carbon. No, wait, no. Wait, the propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would make the two middle carbons each have a Br. So it's CH2BrCHBrCH3. That makes sense because each Br is on a carbon that was part of the double bond.

So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (but wait, the actual name would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, when Br2 adds to CH2=CHCH3, the product is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, that's if the double bond is in the middle. Wait, no—propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds, each Br is added to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. That's 1,2-dibromopropane, right? So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which is E2 elimination. So the reaction would form an alkene. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkyne? Wait, no. Wait, wait. 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr from each Br. Each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to an alkyne. Wait, wait, no. Because each elimination in E2 is removing one H and one Br, so from 1,2-dibromide, you can eliminate two HBr's, leading to a triple bond.

Wait, wait, but think about the structure. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When you treat it with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond. But since there are two Brs adjacent, perhaps two eliminations could occur. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated stepwise.

Wait, but I might be getting confused. Let me think again. Each Br is on adjacent carbons. So the first elimination would remove one Br and form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH2Br. Then, perhaps another elimination would occur, but that would require another Br. Wait, but in the first step, after elimination of one HBr, you have CH2=CHCH2Br. Then, the second Br is on the CH2Br group. Can another E2 happen? The base could abstract a hydrogen from the C adjacent to the Br, leading to another elimination. But wait, after the first elimination, the structure is CH2=CHCH2Br. Now, the Br is on C3. So for another elimination, the H would be abstracted from C2, adjacent to C3. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So for the second elimination, the Br is on C3, and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from C2, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C2 and C3, but that would make CH2=CH2, which is ethylene. Wait, that doesn't make sense because propene only had three carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the initial compound B is 1-bromo-2-bromo propane, which upon treatment with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules, resulting in the formation of propyne (HC≡C-CH3) because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so eliminating both would form a triple bond.

Wait, but propyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2, so the structure is HC≡C-CH3. But wait, in our case, B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, so eliminating two HBr would require removing two Brs and two Hs. So the product C would be CH≡C-CH3, which is 1-propyne. Alternatively, maybe it's propene again, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the first elimination forms 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3), but wait, that's the same as compound A. Hmm, but I think when you have a 1,2-dibromide and you eliminate twice, you can form an alkyne.

So perhaps compound C is propyne, which is an alkyne. So C is HC≡C-CH3.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Red-hot iron is usually used for dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, C is an alkyne. Wait, another thought: passing an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube can cause it to decompose, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Wait, no, iron in the presence of H2 could hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. But wait, there's another possibility. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted to an alkene via a different process.

Wait, but another possibility: when an alkyne is passed over a red-hot iron, it can be dehydrohalogenated again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where the alkyne is hydrogenated. Wait, if C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to propene. So D would be propene again (CH2=CHCH3).

Wait, but wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with a catalyst like iron would typically add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it to a single bond, but under certain conditions, it can stop at the alkene. So if you have propyne (HC≡CCH3) and hydrogenate it over iron, perhaps it becomes propene (CH2=CHCH3). So D is propene.

Then, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric acid, which is a nitrating mixture. So D is propene, which is CH2=CHCH3. If propene undergoes nitration, it would form a nitro compound. But wait, propene is an alkene. The nitration of alkenes typically occurs via an addition mechanism. So the nitronium ion (NO2+) would add across the double bond, forming a di-nitro compound? Or perhaps the reaction is more likely to be an electrophilic addition.

Wait, but propene has a double bond. Reaction with concentrated nitric acid would probably result in the addition of a nitro group across the double bond. So perhaps E would be 1-nitropropane? No, wait, addition would give CH2NO2-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which would make the nitration conditions. So propene would react to form 1-nitropropane, but wait, alkenes typically add nitro groups. Let me think, the addition would be across the double bond. So propene is CH2=CH2 plus CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the nitration would add across the double bond, so the product would be CH2(NO2)-CH2-CH3. That's 2-nitropropane? Or maybe 1-nitropropane.

Wait, but the addition of the nitronium ion would follow anti addition, but perhaps it's more about where the nitro group ends up. Alternatively, perhaps the major product is 1-nitropropane, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the product could be a nitroalkane, but I'm not certain about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not nitration but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, making HCl and possibly some other conditions. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction, but that typically uses a mixture with H2SO4.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. D is propene. Then, reacting with a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3. So, the reaction would be the nitration of propene, leading to the addition of a nitro group across the double bond.

So E would be 2-nitropropane: CH2(NO2)-CH2-CH3.

Then, compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms F. So E is 2-nitropropane. Reaction with Fe and HCl—this sounds like a nitro group being reduced. Iron in HCl is a reducing agent. The nitro group typically gets reduced to an amine. So the nitro group (NO2) would become NH2. So F would be 2-aminopropane, which is CH2NH2CH2CH3, or perhaps the structure is CH3CH2NH2. Wait, no, 2-aminopropane would be CH2CH2NH2CH3? No, wait, propane has three carbons. So 2-aminopropane would be CH2CH(NH2)CH3. Wait, but the structure of 2-nitropropane is CH2NO2-CH2-CH3. So upon reduction, the NO2 becomes NH2, giving CH2NH2-CH2-CH3, which is 2-propanamine, or is it 2-aminopropane.

Wait, but wait—propane has three carbons. So the structure would be CH3-CH(NH2)-CH3. That's 2-aminopropane, also known as isopropylamine.

So F is 2-aminopropane.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization of aromatic amines, but wait, F is a secondary amine. Diazotization usually requires aromatic amines, but maybe in certain conditions, it can form a diazonium salt with aliphatic amines. However, I'm not sure if 2-aminopropane would react with nitrous acid under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction, like forming a nitrosamine, but that's more for aliphatic amines.

Wait, but wait. Diazonium salts are typically formed from aromatic primary amines. For aliphatic amines, especially secondary ones, the reaction with nitrous acid might form a different product. Let me think—when a secondary amine reacts with nitrous acid, especially under cold (0-5°C) and acidic conditions, it can form a diazonium salt. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a nitroso compound. So 2-aminopropane reacting with nitrous acid might form N-nitrosopropane. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: If F is 2-aminopropane, which is a secondary amine, reacting with nitrous acid at low temperature (like 0-5°C) typically leads to the formation of a diazonium salt. But secondary amines can form diazonium salts, but they are less stable than those from primary amines. So, perhaps G is the diazonium salt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the amine into an imine or another compound, but I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think: After F is formed (2-aminopropane), reaction with nitrous acid would typically be diazotization, but since it's a secondary amine, perhaps it forms a different product. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: 2-aminopropane (F) reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium chloride, which then might undergo some decomposition or reaction. But without more info, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's recap: E is 2-nitropropane. F is 2-aminopropane. Then, G is the product of F with nitrous acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of a primary amine from a secondary amine, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps nitrous acid is acting as an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed further and see what happens next, then backtrack if needed.

G reacts with sodium hydroxide to form H. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base. If G is a diazonium salt, then treatment with NaOH might lead to hydrolysis. For example, a diazonium salt can be hydrolyzed to form a carboxylic acid under strong basic conditions. So, if G is the diazonium salt of 2-aminopropane, then H would be the corresponding carboxylic acid.

Wait, but 2-aminopropane is CH3-CH(NH2)-CH3. The diazonium salt would form on the central carbon. So, the hydrolysis would yield CH3-CH(COOH)-CH3, which is 2-propanoic acid, or propanoic acid (since the central carbon is the second position in a three-carbon chain). Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. But in this case, if the structure is CH3-CH(COOH)-CH3, that would be 2-propanoic acid, which is also known as propanoic acid. Wait, actually, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with three carbons: CH3CH2COOH. Wait, but if the central carbon is substituted with COOH, then it's (CH3)2COOH, which is 2-propanoic acid.

Wait, but wait: If F is 2-aminopropane (CH3CH(NH2)CH3), then the diazonium salt would be (CH3)2N+H–N2^–Cl^–. Then, hydrolysis would replace the diazo group with COOH, giving (CH3)2COOH, which is 2-propanoic acid, also known as isobutyric acid. So H would be 2-propanoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different, but let's proceed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is 2-aminopropane, which is isopropylamine. Is isopropylamine used in dye synthesis? I'm not sure, but primary amines are more commonly used in dyeing. Isopropylamine is a secondary amine, which might have different reactivity. So I'm not sure about this.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid. Ferric chloride is FeCl3; adding it to a solution of a phenol would give a red-brown color due to the formation of a complex. But 2-propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't have a phenolic OH group. So it wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Wait, no—wait, some carboxylic acids can form colored complexes with FeCl3, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if H were a phenol, then it would give a color. Since H is a carboxylic acid, perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). The NMR of propene would have certain signals. Let's think: in propene, the two CH2 groups are on either end of the double bond. The left CH2 (CH2=) would have two protons, and the right CH3 (CH2=CH-) would have three protons. The CH2 group would be split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2, but wait, in propene, each end is CH2 and CH3. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CHCH3.

The protons on the CH2 group (left) would couple with the CH group (middle). The middle CH has two protons (since it's CH2=CH-CH3), no, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH2-CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the left side is CH2, the middle is CH, and the right is CH3.

The left CH2 (CH2=) has two equivalent protons. The middle CH (CH2=CH-) has two protons? No, wait, in propene, the middle carbon is CH, attached to two CH2 groups. No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Let me think again. The structure is:

CH2=CH-CH3.

So, the left CH2 group has two protons, the middle CH has two protons (since it's CH2=CH-), and the right CH3 has three protons.

Wait, no. Wait, in CH2=CHCH3, the middle carbon is CH2? No, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so Carbon 1 is CH2, double bonded to Carbon 2, which is CH, which is connected to CH3. So Carbon 1: CH2, Carbon 2: CH, Carbon 3: CH3.

So the protons on Carbon 1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond. These protons are on a CH2 group and would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH group (which has two protons). But wait, the CH group has only one proton if it's CH, right? No, wait, the middle carbon is CH, connected to the CH2 and the CH3. So the middle carbon has only one proton. Let me think:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH3.

So the protons on Carbon 1 (CH2=) would be adjacent to the CH group (Carbon 2), which has one proton.

Wait, that's getting confusing. Let me think of it as:

Structure: CH2=CHCH3.

So, the left CH2 is attached to the double bond, and the middle CH is part of the double bond.

The CH2 group (left) has two protons, the CH (middle) has two protons? No, wait, the middle CH is actually CH2 when double bonded. No, wait, in a double bond, each carbon can only have one other bond. So Carbon 2 is CH, bonded to Carbon 1 (CH2), Carbon 3 (CH3), and the double bond.

So the CH group (Carbon 2) has one proton. So in the NMR, the CH2 (left) protons would be split by the CH (middle) proton. Since the CH has only one proton, the CH2 protons would be a quartet? Or perhaps a doublet, but wait, the coupling would lead to a doublet of doublets if there's coupling on both sides. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 protons are split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH's single proton.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR of propene.

In propene, the CH2 group (left) has two equivalent protons. The CH (middle) has two protons? No, wait, no. Wait, in propene, each CH2 group on either end has two protons, but the middle is a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Propene is CH2=CH2 + CH3, making it CH2=CHCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is a CH3.

So, the protons on C1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond. These would be a set of protons that are equivalent. They are adjacent to the C2 which is a CH. The CH on C2 has two protons (wait, no, because it's CH, so only one proton). So, the C1 CH2 protons would couple with the C2 CH proton, resulting in a doublet. The C2 CH proton would couple with the C1 CH2 protons, leading to a triplet. And the C3 CH3 protons would be a singlet because they're not adjacent to any other protons on the same carbon.

Wait, no, C3 is CH3, so their protons are all equivalent and not split by any adjacent non-equivalent protons. So in the NMR, the C3 protons would be a singlet.

The C1 CH2 protons would be split by the C2 CH proton. Since the C2 has one proton, the C1 CH2 would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2, so 3 peaks). Or wait, wait: the number of neighboring protons is 1 (from C2), so each of the two protons in C1 would split into a doublet. But because they are equivalent, the splitting would lead to a triplet for the C1 CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the C1 CH2 is adjacent to a CH (C2) that has one proton. So each proton in C1's CH2 group is split by the C2's single proton into a doublet. But the two protons in C1's CH2 are equivalent, so their splitting would lead to a doublet. Similarly, the C2 CH proton is split by the C1's two protons into a triplet.

So in the 1H NMR, we would see:

- C1 CH2: triplet (integral 2H)
- C2 CH: triplet (integral 1H)
- C3 CH3: singlet (integral 3H)

Wait, but wait, the C2 CH has one proton, and it's adjacent to C1's two protons, so it would split into a triplet. But wait, in reality, in propene, the C2 CH has two protons? No, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH3, so C2 is CH, so only one proton. So the C2 proton would be a triplet because it's next to C1's two protons. The C1's protons would be a doublet because they're next to one proton. But wait, that's not possible because the C1 has two protons, each adjacent to one proton in C2. So the C1's two protons would each split into a doublet, but since they're equivalent, the total would be a doublet.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me look up the NMR of propene. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I remember that propene has a triplet for the CH2 group and a triplet for the CH group. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is different.

Alternatively, considering that the double bond causes the CH2 and CH groups to be deshielded but more importantly, the coupling between the protons across the double bond. Wait, in propene, the protons on the CH2 are trans to the CH3 on the same carbon. So maybe there's coupling between the CH2 protons and the CH3 protons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons are a triplet, the CH proton is a triplet, and the CH3 is a singlet. So in total, the NMR would show three signals: triplet (2H), triplet (1H), and singlet (3H). But the question says that D (which is propene) gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. That's not correct because the CH2 and CH would have more splitting.

So, looking back at option C: "C gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra." Wait, no. Option C says D gives two singlets. D is propene. If propene's NMR has triplet, triplet, and singlet, then option C is incorrect. So perhaps option C is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me re-examine. I thought D is propene. If D is propene, and its NMR has three signals (CH2 triplet, CH triplet, CH3 singlet), then option C, which says D gives two singlets, is incorrect. So option C is an incorrect statement.

Now, looking at the other options.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is an alkyne. Alkynes are gases under certain conditions, but propyne (HC≡CCH3) is a liquid or gas depending on the conditions. Wait, but wait, propyne, also known as methylacetylene, is a gas at room temperature. So if C is propyne, then D is propene. So yes, C is a gas, and since it's an alkyne, it's flammable. So option D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be option C because D (propene) doesn't give two singlets in its NMR; it has multiple signals.

Wait, but in the earlier steps, I thought C is propyne. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier steps: A is propene (C3H6). B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. The reaction would be dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr molecules to form an alkyne. So C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), which is a gas. Then, C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, possibly hydrogenating it to propene (D). So D is propene.

So, D's NMR would have the triplet (CH2), triplet (CH), and singlet (CH3), making three signals. So option C says D gives two singlets, which is incorrect. Because in D's NMR, only the CH3 would be a singlet; the other groups would have split signals. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a reddish-brown precipitate. 2-propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a phenol, so it wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B is incorrect. Wait, but I thought H is a carboxylic acid, so option B's statement is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought option C is incorrect, but now I'm considering option B.

Wait, what's the color? If H is a phenolic compound, FeCl3 would give a reddish-brown color. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it would form a different complex. Alternatively, some carboxylic acids can form colored complexes with FeCl3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is something else.

Wait, let me think again about the steps leading to H. F is 2-aminopropane, reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If G is a diazonium salt, then H would be the corresponding carboxylic acid. So H is 2-propanoic acid (CH3)2COOH. So, when you add FeCl3 to 2-propanoic acid, would it form a precipitate? I don't think so because 2-propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So option B's statement is incorrect because H wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C is incorrect because D's NMR has three signals, not two singlets. So now I'm a bit confused.

Let me summarize:

Option C claims that D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). The NMR would have:

- CH2 (left): triplet (coupled with CH)
- CH (middle): triplet (coupled with CH2)
- CH3 (right): singlet.

So three signals, not two. So option C is incorrect.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is 2-propanoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. FeCl3 reacts with phenols, not carboxylic acids, so option B's statement is incorrect.

Wait, but which is the incorrect statement in the question? The question asks for the incorrect statement about the products.

So both options B and C may have incorrect statements, but let me think again.

Wait, the question asks for the incorrect statement about the products. So I need to determine which option is incorrect.

If option C says D gives two singlets, but D's NMR has three signals, then option C is incorrect.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. Since H is a carboxylic acid, it doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a color, so option B is incorrect.

So which option is incorrect as per the problem?

The problem states that the options are about the products, and I need to find the incorrect statement.

So, the options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

I've determined that option C is incorrect because D's NMR has three signals, not two. Option B is incorrect because H is a carboxylic acid and doesn't react with FeCl3 to form a color.

But wait, the options can't both be incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D. Let me re-examine the reaction steps again.

A is C3H6: propene.

B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Reacts with alcoholic KOH: dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr, forming an alkyne. So C is propyne.

D is formed by passing C (propyne) through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron with propyne would likely hydrogenate it to propene. So D is propene.

So, D's NMR has three signals: triplet, triplet, singlet.

Option C says two singlets. So C is incorrect.

H is 2-propanoic acid. Reaction with FeCl3: since it's a carboxylic acid, it might not react. So option B's statement is incorrect. So both B and C are incorrect? But the options are structured so that only one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction leading to H. Let me re-examine.

F is 2-aminopropane.

Reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G.

Then G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is a primary amine, then G would be a diazonium salt. But F is 2-aminopropane, which is a secondary amine. Diazonium salts from secondary amines are less common, but perhaps under certain conditions, they can form. Then, when G is treated with NaOH, it would hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid.

So H is 2-propanoic acid.

So option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. But H is a carboxylic acid, so no, option B is incorrect.

Thus, the incorrect statement is either B or C.

But the problem says only one option is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is incorrect.

So, let's see:

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propene, which has three signals. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a color. So option B is incorrect.

So both B and C are incorrect? But the question asks to choose one incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the reaction where C is treated with Fe and HCl to form F, I got the structure wrong.

Let me re-examine that step.

E is 2-nitropropane: CH2NO2-CH2-CH3.

Reaction with Fe and HCl: nitro group is reduced to amine. So E is CH2NO2CH2CH3 → F is CH2NH2CH2CH3. So F is 2-aminopropane.

But wait, is 2-aminopropane a primary or secondary amine? It's a secondary amine because the NH2 is attached to a carbon connected to two other carbons.

So F is a secondary amine. When a secondary amine reacts with nitrous acid, it can form a diazonium salt, but these are less stable. So G would be the diazonium salt.

Then, G reacts with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids. So if G is (CH3)2N+H–N2Cl^-, then hydrolysis would yield (CH3)2COOH, which is 2-propanoic acid (H is 2-propanoic acid).

So, H is 2-propanoic acid.

Thus, option B's statement is incorrect because H is a carboxylic acid and not a phenol, so it doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color.

But the problem is, the question states that all statements except one are correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D.

Wait, perhaps D is not propene. Let me think again.

When C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to propene. So D is propene.

But another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't think so because C is an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is used for a different reaction. Another possibility is that the alkyne is converted to an alkene via a different mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is decomposed upon heating with iron to form ethylene and something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is used for catalytic dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. Propyne decomposes upon heating to form acetylene and other products, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to an alkane. If so, D would be propane.

Wait, if C is propyne, and it's hydrogenated with iron as a catalyst to form propane (CH3CH2CH3), then D is propane.

If D is propane, then its NMR would show only one signal: a singlet for the three CH3 groups. So option C: D gives two singlets. No, that's not possible. So option C would be incorrect.

But in this scenario, D is propane, which is a singlet in NMR. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is propane, then option C is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought D was propene. So which is correct?

Wait, the reaction of propyne with a red-hot iron. I'm a bit uncertain about this step.

Propyne (HC≡CCH3) is an alkyne. When passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated. Iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so in the presence of H2, it would add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting the alkyne to an alkene (propene) or an alkane (propane).

Without H2, perhaps it's not a hydrogenation. Another possibility is that the alkyne decomposes upon heating. Let me think: alkynes can undergo various thermal decompositions, such as forming acetylene and other products, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to an alkene via a different mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne remains as is, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed with D being propane, but I'm not confident.

If D is propane, then its NMR would be a singlet (only CH3 groups), so option C says D gives two singlets, which is incorrect. So option C would be incorrect.

But then, earlier steps would require C to be propyne and D to be propane. Let me think again: propyne (HC≡CCH3) upon passing through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps in the presence of hydrogen, would hydrogenate to propane.

In that case, D is propane.

Thus, D's NMR would be a singlet (three CH3 groups), so option C says D gives two singlets, which is incorrect.

So, whether D is propene or propane, option C is incorrect because propene's NMR has three signals, not two, and propane's NMR has one singlet.

Thus, option C is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought option B was also incorrect, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let's re-examine.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a colored complex. Carboxylic acids don't do that. So option B is incorrect.

So both options B and C are incorrect. But the problem states that only one option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of H. Let me think again.

If F is 2-aminopropane, and it's treated with nitrous acid, perhaps it doesn't form a diazonium salt but instead undergoes another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: 2-aminopropane (secondary amine) reacts with nitrous acid to form N-nitrosopropane. Then, when treated with NaOH, perhaps it doesn't form a carboxylic acid but something else.

Alternatively, maybe F is a primary amine. Wait, no, F is 2-aminopropane, which is a secondary amine.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of F with nitrous acid doesn't form a diazonium salt but instead forms an amine oxide.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of E.

Wait, let me think again. E is the product of D (propene) reacting with two strong acids. If the two acids are concentrated sulfuric and nitric, then E would be the nitration product. So nitration of propene (an alkene) would add a nitro group across the double bond. The product would be 1-nitropropane (if the addition is to the first carbon), or 2-nitropropane.

But in the nitration of propene, the nitro group would add across the double bond, giving 1-nitropropane (CH2NO2CH2CH3) or 2-nitropropane (CH3CHNO2CH3). Wait, no, the addition would be in a way that the nitro group adds to the less substituted position. Wait, in propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding NO2+ across the double bond would lead to CH2NO2-CH2-CH3 (1-nitropropane) or CH3-CHNO2-CH3 (2-nitropropane). Which is more likely? The addition would likely follow Markovnikov's rule, but for nitration, it's more about the stability of the intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs via a cyclic intermediate, leading to the most stable product. But I'm not certain.

If E is 2-nitropropane, then F would be 2-aminopropane upon reduction. Then, G would be the diazonium salt, and H would be 2-propanoic acid.

Alternatively, if E is 1-nitropropane, then F would be 1-aminopropane (CH2NH2CH2CH3). Then, when treated with nitrous acid, it would form a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis would form propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), which is different from before.

But regardless, H would be a carboxylic acid and wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B's statement is incorrect.

Thus, the incorrect statement is either B or C.

But the problem specifies only one incorrect option.

Perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

If D is propene, which has three signals, then option C is incorrect.

If D is propane, which has one singlet, then option C is incorrect.

So regardless, option C is incorrect.

Option B is also incorrect, but perhaps I made a mistake in F's structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps F is 1-aminopropane (primary amine), which when treated with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt, and upon hydrolysis would form propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), which is a different structure.

But in that case, H would be propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. Then, H's structure is CH2CH2COOH, which is a three-carbon carboxylic acid.

But regardless, H is a carboxylic acid, so option B's statement remains incorrect.

Given all this, I think the incorrect statements are both B and C, but since the question expects one, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the structure of D.

Alternative approach: Let me go step by step again.

1. A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3).

2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

3. React with alcoholic KOH: E2 elimination, removes two HBr → forms propyne (CH≡CCH3).

4. Propyne (C) passed through red-hot iron: likely hydrogenated to propane (CH3CH2CH3) if fully hydrogenated, or propene (CH2=CHCH3) if partially hydrogenated.

Assuming partial hydrogenation, D is propene.

5. D (propene) reacts with two strong acids (likely H2SO4 and HNO3) → nitration adds NO2 group across double bond. Product E is 1-nitropropane or 2-nitropropane.

6. E treated with Fe and HCl → reduces nitro group to amine. If E is 2-nitropropane, F is 2-aminopropane.

7. F reacts with nitrous acid → forms diazonium salt (G).

8. G treated with NaOH → hydrolyzes to carboxylic acid (H is 2-propanoic acid: (CH3)2COOH).

So H is 2-propanoic acid.

Now, looking at the options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is 2-aminopropane (secondary amine). Are secondary amines used in dye synthesis? I'm not sure. Dyes often use primary amines, but perhaps some use secondary. I'm not certain if this is correct.

B) H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, so incorrect.

C) D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propene, which has three signals, so incorrect.

D) C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is a gas, so correct.

So options B and C are incorrect. The question asks for the incorrect statement. But only one option can be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the NMR analysis of D.

If D is propene (CH2=CHCH3), the NMR would have:

- The CH2 group (left) as a triplet (integral 2H)
- The CH group (middle) as a triplet (integral 1H)
- The CH3 group (right) as a singlet (integral 3H)

So three signals. So option C, which says D gives two singlets, is incorrect.

Option B, H is a carboxylic acid and doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B's statement is incorrect.

Thus, both B and C are incorrect. But the problem states that only one is incorrect. So perhaps one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of H.

Wait, perhaps when F (2-aminopropane) reacts with nitrous acid, it forms a different product.

Another possibility: F is 2-aminopropane, which reacts with nitrous acid to form N-nitrosopropane (an N-nitrosamine). Then, when treated with NaOH, perhaps it doesn't form a carboxylic acid but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is formed, but it's unstable and decomposes. Diazonium salts of secondary amines are less stable, so perhaps they decompose to form an imine or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of F with nitrous acid doesn't proceed, making G the same as F. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form something else.

But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of F with nitrous acid is an oxidation, forming a hydroxylamine or something else.

But given the time I've spent, I think the key incorrect statements are B and C.

But according to the options, only one is incorrect. So perhaps I should focus on the options again.

The question is, which statement is incorrect.

If I have to choose between B and C, perhaps I should think about which one is more definitely incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is 2-propanoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids don't react with FeCl3 to give a color. So option B is definitely incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. D is propene, which has three signals, so option C is incorrect.

Thus, both B and C are incorrect. But the question says only one is incorrect. Hmm.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D.

Wait, another possibility: when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's dehydrohalogenated again to form something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is used for the dehydrogenation of the alkyne to form an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of propyne with iron and HCl forms a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is propyne, and D is acetylene (ethyne), which is even more unsaturated. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps D isn't propene but something else.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I think the incorrect statements are B and C. But since the question expects one, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, the question says which statement is incorrect about the products. So, perhaps option C is incorrect because propene's NMR has three signals, not two.

Thus, the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃) as compound B. Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two equivalents of HBr to form an alkyne, propyne (HC≡C-CH₃), as compound C. 

When propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes catalytic hydrogenation to form propene (CH₂=CH-CH₃) as compound D. Reaction of D with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃) results in nitration, where a nitro group adds across the double bond, forming 1-nitropropane or 2-nitropropane as compound E. Reduction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid converts the nitro group to an amine, yielding 2-aminopropane (CH₃-CH(NH₂)-CH₃) as compound F. 

Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms a diazonium salt (G), which upon treatment with sodium hydroxide hydrolyzes to form 2-propanoic acid (CH₃-CH(COOH)-CH₃) as compound H.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.  
   F is 2-aminopropane, a secondary amine. While primary amines are more commonly used in dye synthesis, secondary amines like 2-aminopropane can also participate in dye formation. This statement is plausible.

2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.  
   H is 2-propanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a reddish-brown precipitate, but it does not react with carboxylic acids to give a yellow color. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.  
   D is propene (CH₂=CH-CH₃). Its ¹H NMR spectrum shows three signals: a triplet for the CH₂ group (2H), a triplet for the CH group (1H), and a singlet for the CH₃ group (3H). Therefore, D does not give two singlets, making this statement incorrect.

4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas.  
   C is propyne (HC≡C-CH₃), which is a gas at room temperature and highly flammable. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options B and C are incorrect. However, since the question specifies identifying the incorrect statement, and option B explicitly contradicts the chemical nature of H, it is the best choice for the incorrect statement.

**Answer: B**
