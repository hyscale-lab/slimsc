Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are A to D. Hmm.

I remember that spin states are represented as two-component vectors, right? So the state here is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So the state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, these vectors are usually normalized, I think. Do I need to normalize this first?

Let me think. The expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨χ| O |χ⟩, where O is the operator. Since this is spin, the spin operator S_y for a spin-1/2 particle would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Wait, the σ_y matrix is given as:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would then be ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Let me compute that.

First, I need to compute the conjugate transpose of χ, which is χ†. So χ is [3i, 4]^T. Its conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4 ] since (3i)* is -3 (because i squared is -1, so 3i's conjugate is -3i, but wait, wait, wait. Let me get that straight. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? Because i becomes -i. So χ† would be [-3i, 4].

Wait, no. The components are 3i and 4. So χ† would be [ -3i* , 4* ]^T. Since 4 is real, its conjugate is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait no, no. Let me write it correctly. The original vector is:

χ = [ 3i, 4 ]^T as a column vector. So the conjugate transpose (dagger) would be a row vector [ (3i)* , (4)* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. Let me write out σ_y again:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So now, the expectation value is χ† * S_y * χ. Let's compute this step by step.

First, compute S_y * χ. Let me compute that matrix multiplication.

S_y * χ is (ħ/2) * σ_y multiplied by the vector [3i, 4]^T.

So let's compute σ_y * [3i,4]^T first.

σ_y * [3i,4] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ].

Wait, no, matrix multiplication is rows of the matrix times the column vector. So the first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

The second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * [3i,4]^T = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, multiply by (ħ/2), so S_y * χ is [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ]^T.

Now, compute χ† multiplied by this result.

χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† * (S_y * χ) = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ]^T.

Let me calculate each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i)(ħ/2) → (12 i²) (ħ/2) → 12*(-1) * ħ/2 = -12 ħ / 2.

Second term: 4 * (-3)(ħ/2) → -12 ħ / 2.

So adding these together:

-12 ħ/2 + (-12 ħ/2) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value of spin shouldn't be that large. Wait, because for spin-1/2 systems, the maximum S_y is ħ/2, right? So getting an expectation value of -12 ħ is way beyond that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot the normalization of the state vector. Because the state vector's norm squared should be 1 for a normalized state. Let me check the norm of χ.

The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So sqrt(25) is 5. So the state vector isn't normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to have norm 1.

Oh, right. So χ is [3i, 4]^T, and its norm is sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + 4*4 )= sqrt(9 +16) =5. So the normalized state would be [3i/5, 4/5]^T. So I should have used the normalized state for the expectation value.

So I need to correct that. Because using the non-normalized state would give an incorrect expectation value.

So let me redo the calculation with the normalized state.

The normalized χ is [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

So χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Now, compute S_y * χ.

S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y.

σ_y * [3i/5, 4/5 ]^T.

First component: (0)(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) = 0 + (-4i/5) = -4i/5.

Second component: (i)(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 + 0 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y * χ is [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T.

Multiply by ħ/2: S_y * χ = [ (-4i/5)(ħ/2), (-3/5)(ħ/2) ]^T.

Now, compute χ† * S_y * χ.

χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

So the dot product becomes:

( -3i/5 ) * ( (-4i/5)(ħ/2) ) + (4/5) * ( (-3/5)(ħ/2) )

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) * (ħ/2)
Multiply the constants and the i terms.

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Denominator: 5*5=25.

So first term becomes (-12) / (25) ) * (ħ/2) → (-12 ħ)/(50).

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) * (ħ/2) → Multiply 4*(-3) = -12. Denominator 5*5=25. So (-12)/(25) * ħ/2 → (-12 ħ)/(50).

Now sum both terms:

(-12 ħ/50 ) + (-12 ħ/50 ) = (-24 ħ)/50 = (-12 ħ)/25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again to make sure.

Wait, the first term:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) ) = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Multiply by ħ/2: (-12/25) * (ħ/2) → -12 ħ / 50.

Second term:

(4/5) * (-3/5 ) = (-12)/(25). Multiply by ħ/2: (-12/25) * (ħ/2) → -12 ħ /50.

So sum is (-24 ħ)/50 = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which is option A: -12 hbar/25.

Wait, but let me double-check the multiplication of the matrices and vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for expectation value without normalizing first.

Let me try that approach. So the state is [3i,4]. The norm squared is (3i)*( -3i ) +4^2 = 9 +16=25. So the normalization factor is 1/5.

The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (χ† S_y χ) / (χ† χ) ).

Because χ is not normalized, but to get the correct expectation value, I have to divide by the norm squared.

So, let's compute χ† S_y χ first without normalization.

As before, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

S_y is (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

χ is [3i,4]^T.

So S_y χ would be as before:

σ_y * [3i,4]^T = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Multiply by (ħ/2) → [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ].

Then χ† S_y χ is [ -3i, 4 ] * [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ].

Calculating each component:

( -3i )*(-4i ħ/2 ) + 4*(-3 ħ/2 )

Let me compute each part.

First part: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12. Multiply by ħ/2: (12)*( -1 ) * ħ/2 = (-12 ħ)/2 = -6 ħ.

Second part: 4*(-3) = -12, times ħ/2: (-12)(ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

So sum is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Now, the norm of χ is 25, as before.

So the expectation value is ( -12 ħ ) /25.

Which matches the earlier result. So the answer is option A: -12 hbar/25.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).
2. The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\chi^\dagger S_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi} \), where \( \chi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \chi \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The norm of \( \chi \) is:
\[
\chi^\dagger \chi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
\chi_{\text{norm}} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} \)
Using \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), we calculate:
\[
\sigma_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Multiplying by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we get:
\[
S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i \hbar}{10} \\ -\frac{3 \hbar}{10} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} \)
The conjugate transpose of \( \chi_{\text{norm}} \) is:
\[
\chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now, compute the dot product:
\[
\chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = \left( -\frac{3i}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{4i \hbar}{10} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{3 \hbar}{10} \right).
\]
1. First term:
\[
\left( -\frac{3i}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{4i \hbar}{10} \right) = \frac{12 i^2 \hbar}{50} = \frac{12 (-1) \hbar}{50} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{50}.
\]
2. Second term:
\[
\left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{3 \hbar}{10} \right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{50}.
\]
Adding these:
\[
\chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{50} - \frac{12 \hbar}{50} = -\frac{24 \hbar}{50} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
