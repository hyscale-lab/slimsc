Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, the neutrino is a neutrino, not a neutron. I think the formula is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. 

Wait, but wait, the question says "nu" as the product. I think nu usually stands for a neutrino. So the reaction is Pi+ at rest decays into a muon plus a neutrino. Right. 

The problem gives me the rest masses: the pion has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is considered massless in these kinds of problems, I believe, because its mass is negligible. So when calculating, its rest energy is zero.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with two energies. I'm guessing these are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, neutrinos are leptons, and in decay processes, they carry off energy and momentum. But because the pion is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. 

So, since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon has rest mass, so its total energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's total energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu. This must equal the initial energy, 139.6 MeV. So,

105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6

So K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. That's one equation.

Now, for conservation of momentum. The momentum of the muon is p, and the neutrino's is -p, so that they cancel each other. 

The magnitude of the muon's momentum is p = gamma * m_mu * v. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for the muon, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. For the neutrino, E_nu² = (p c)^2, because its mass is zero.

So, for the muon:

E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2

For the neutrino:

E_nu² = (p c)^2

So, let's denote E_nu as E_nu, which is equal to p c. Then, substituting into the muon's equation:

E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2

But E_mu is (105.7 MeV + K_mu), and E_nu is K_nu. So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

(105.7)^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Subtract (105.7)^2 from both sides:

2*105.7*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = K_nu^2

But we already have from the energy equation that K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV. Let me call this Equation 1.

So I have two equations:

Equation 1: K_mu + K_nu = 33.9

Equation 2: 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = K_nu²

Let me substitute K_nu from Equation 1 into Equation 2.

From Equation 1: K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu

Substitute into Equation 2:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Expand the right side:

= (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²

So equation becomes:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²

I can subtract K_mu² from both sides, which cancels them out:

2*105.7*K_mu = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu

Bring all terms to the left:

2*105.7*K_mu + 2*33.9*K_mu = (33.9)^2

Factor K_mu:

K_mu * [2*(105.7 + 33.9)] = (33.9)^2

Calculating the terms inside the brackets:

105.7 + 33.9 = 139.6

So,

K_mu * (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2

So,

K_mu = (33.9)^2 / (2 * 139.6)

Calculate numerator: 33.9^2 = approx 33.9 * 33.9. Let me compute that.

33 *33=1089, 0.9*33=29.7, 33 *0.9=29.7, 0.9*0.9=0.81.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 33.9^2 = (30 + 3.9)^2 = 30^2 + 2*30*3.9 + 3.9^2.

30^2 = 900.

2*30*3.9 = 60 *3.9 = 234.

3.9^2 = 15.21.

Adding them: 900 + 234 = 1134 +15.21=1149.21.

So numerator is approximately 1149.21 (MeV)^2.

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 1149.21 by 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 *4= 1116.8

1149.21 -1116.8=32.41.

So 4 plus (32.41/279.2) ≈ 4 + 0.116 = 4.116 MeV.

So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then, K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu ≈33.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 and 29.8. So that's option D.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations because sometimes when I approximate, I might get it wrong.

Wait, 2*105.7 is 211.4. 211.4 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact value.

Let me compute 33.9^2 exactly.

33.9 *33.9 = ?

33 *33 = 1089.

33 *0.9 =29.7

0.9 *33=29.7

0.9 *0.9=0.81.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as (34 -0.1)^2.

(34 -0.1)^2 = 34^2 - 2*34*0.1 +0.1^2.

34^2=1156.

2*34*0.1=6.8.

0.1^2=0.01.

So 1156 - 6.8 = 1149.2; plus 0.01 is 1149.21. So that's correct.

Denominator is 2*(105.7 +33.9)=2*(139.6)=279.2.

So 1149.21 / 279.2 = ?

Calculating 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. Subtract: 1149.21 - 1116.8 =32.41.

32.41 /279.2 = approximately 0.116.

So 4.116 MeV.

So K_mu is about 4.12 MeV, and K_nu is 33.9 -4.12=29.78, which is roughly 29.8 MeV. So option D is correct.

So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is at rest, and its rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass of \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy:
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's total energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_\mu,
\]  
and the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\nu} = K_\nu.
\]  
Thus,  
\[
105.7 + K_\mu + K_\nu = 139.6.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
K_\mu + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}. \tag{1}
\]

### Conservation of Momentum:
Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. The muon and neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:  
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2, \quad E_{\nu}^2 = (p c)^2.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_\mu\) and \(E_{\nu} = K_\nu\):  
\[
(105.7 + K_\mu)^2 = (K_\nu)^2 + (105.7)^2. \tag{2}
\]

### Solving the Equations:
From Equation (1):  
\[
K_\nu = 33.9 - K_\mu.
\]  
Substitute \(K_\nu\) into Equation (2):  
\[
(105.7 + K_\mu)^2 = (33.9 - K_\mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expanding both sides:  
\[
105.7^2 + 2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2 + 105.7^2.
\]  
Cancel \(105.7^2\) and \(K_\mu^2\) from both sides:  
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu.
\]  
Combine terms:  
\[
K_\mu \cdot (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
K_\mu \cdot 279.2 = 1149.21.
\]  
Solve for \(K_\mu\):  
\[
K_\mu = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Substitute \(K_\mu\) into Equation (1) to find \(K_\nu\):  
\[
K_\nu = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, the neutrino is a neutrino, not a neutron. I think the formula is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. 

Wait, but wait, the question says "nu" as the product. I think nu usually stands for a neutrino. So the reaction is Pi+ at rest decays into a muon plus a neutrino. Right. 

The problem gives me the rest masses: the pion has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is considered massless in these kinds of problems, I believe, because its mass is negligible. So when calculating, its rest energy is zero.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with two energies. I'm guessing these are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, neutrinos are leptons, and in decay processes, they carry off energy and momentum. But because the pion is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. 

So, since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon has rest mass, so its total energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's total energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu. This must equal the initial energy, 139.6 MeV. So,

105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6

So K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. That's one equation.

Now, for conservation of momentum. The momentum of the muon is p, and the neutrino's is -p, so that they cancel each other. 

The magnitude of the muon's momentum is p = gamma * m_mu * v. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for the muon, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. For the neutrino, E_nu² = (p c)^2, because its mass is zero.

So, for the muon:

E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2

For the neutrino:

E_nu² = (p c)^2

So, let's denote E_nu as E_nu, which is equal to p c. Then, substituting into the muon's equation:

E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2

But E_mu is (105.7 MeV + K_mu), and E_nu is K_nu. So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

(105.7)^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Subtract (105.7)^2 from both sides:

2*105.7*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = K_nu^2

But we already have from the energy equation that K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV. Let me call this Equation 1.

So I have two equations:

Equation 1: K_mu + K_nu = 33.9

Equation 2: 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = K_nu²

Let me substitute K_nu from Equation 1 into Equation 2.

From Equation 1: K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu

Substitute into Equation 2:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Expand the right side:

= (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²

So equation becomes:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²

I can subtract K_mu² from both sides, which cancels them out:

2*105.7*K_mu = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu

Bring all terms to the left:

2*105.7*K_mu + 2*33.9*K_mu = (33.9)^2

Factor K_mu:

K_mu * [2*(105.7 + 33.9)] = (33.9)^2

Calculating the terms inside the brackets:

105.7 + 33.9 = 139.6

So,

K_mu * (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2

So,

K_mu = (33.9)^2 / (2 * 139.6)

Calculate numerator: 33.9^2 = approx 33.9 * 33.9. Let me compute that.

33 *33=1089, 0.9*33=29.7, 33 *0.9=29.7, 0.9*0.9=0.81.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 33.9^2 = (30 + 3.9)^2 = 30^2 + 2*30*3.9 + 3.9^2.

30^2 = 900.

2*30*3.9 = 60 *3.9 = 234.

3.9^2 = 15.21.

Adding them: 900 + 234 = 1134 +15.21=1149.21.

So numerator is approximately 1149.21 (MeV)^2.

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 1149.21 by 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 *4= 1116.8

1149.21 -1116.8=32.41.

So 4 plus (32.41/279.2) ≈ 4 + 0.116 = 4.116 MeV.

So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then, K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu ≈33.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 and 29.8. So that's option D.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations because sometimes when I approximate, I might get it wrong.

Wait, 2*105.7 is 211.4. 211.4 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact value.

Let me compute 33.9^2 exactly.

33.9 *33.9 = ?

33 *33 = 1089.

33 *0.9 =29.7

0.9 *33=29.7

0.9 *0.9=0.81.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as (34 -0.1)^2.

(34 -0.1)^2 = 34^2 - 2*34*0.1 +0.1^2.

34^2=1156.

2*34*0.1=6.8.

0.1^2=0.01.

So 1156 - 6.8 = 1149.2; plus 0.01 is 1149.21. So that's correct.

Denominator is 2*(105.7 +33.9)=2*(139.6)=279.2.

So 1149.21 / 279.2 = ?

Calculating 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. Subtract: 1149.21 - 1116.8 =32.41.

32.41 /279.2 = approximately 0.116.

So 4.116 MeV.

So K_mu is about 4.12 MeV, and K_nu is 33.9 -4.12=29.78, which is roughly 29.8 MeV. So option D is correct.

So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is at rest, and its rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass of \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy:
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's total energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_\mu,
\]  
and the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\nu} = K_\nu.
\]  
Thus,  
\[
105.7 + K_\mu + K_\nu = 139.6.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
K_\mu + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}. \tag{1}
\]

### Conservation of Momentum:
Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. The muon and neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:  
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2, \quad E_{\nu}^2 = (p c)^2.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_\mu\) and \(E_{\nu} = K_\nu\):  
\[
(105.7 + K_\mu)^2 = (K_\nu)^2 + (105.7)^2. \tag{2}
\]

### Solving the Equations:
From Equation (1):  
\[
K_\nu = 33.9 - K_\mu.
\]  
Substitute \(K_\nu\) into Equation (2):  
\[
(105.7 + K_\mu)^2 = (33.9 - K_\mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expanding both sides:  
\[
105.7^2 + 2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2 + 105.7^2.
\]  
Cancel \(105.7^2\) and \(K_\mu^2\) from both sides:  
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu.
\]  
Combine terms:  
\[
K_\mu \cdot (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
K_\mu \cdot 279.2 = 1149.21.
\]  
Solve for \(K_\mu\):  
\[
K_\mu = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Substitute \(K_\mu\) into Equation (1) to find \(K_\nu\):  
\[
K_\nu = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
