Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have three spins S1, S2, S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And we need to find the partition function Z, given the options.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate their respective energies, then sum the exponentials.

Let me start by figuring out how many possible states there are. Each spin has two options, so for three spins, that's 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I'll list all the possible combinations and calculate E for each.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without listing all 8 states. Let's think about the possible values of S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each of these products can be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.

So the energy E is -J times the sum of those three terms. Let me denote each term as follows: let A = S1S2, B = S1S3, C = S2S3. Then E = -J (A + B + C). But each of A, B, C can be +1 or -1.

Wait, but the sum A+B+C can range from -3 to +3. So possible values are -3, -1, +1, +3. Hmm, but wait: can all these be achieved? Let's see.

Wait, if all three pairs are +1, then A+B+C = 3. That's possible if all spins are the same, say all +1: S1=S2=S3=+1. Then A=1, B=1, C=1. So sum is 3.

If two are +1 and one is -1: let's say A=1, B=1, C=-1. Sum is 1. Or A=1, B=-1, C=1. Sum=1, etc.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's easier to calculate how many states give each possible value of (A+B+C). Because the energy depends on the sum, so each unique sum will contribute a certain number of states, each with the same E.

So first, possible sum S= A+B+C can be:

Let me think: Each of A, B, C is +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, no, because the sum must be an odd number because you're adding three odd terms. So yes, possible sums are 3,1,-1,-3.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me count how many states give each sum.

Case 1: Sum = 3 → all A, B, C are +1. How many states correspond to that?

A= S1S2=1 → S1=S2.

B= S1S3=1 → S1=S3.

C= S2S3=1 → S2=S3.

So all three must be the same. So either all +1 or all -1. So two states: S1=S2=S3=+1, or all -1.

So for sum=3, there are two states, each contributing E = -J*(3).

Wait, no, wait. Because E = -J (A+B+C). So when A+B+C=3, E=-3J.

So each of these two states contributes exp(β * 3J), because Z is sum of exp(-βE). Since E=-3J, -βE = 3J β.

Wait, no: Z is sum of exp(-β E). So E is -3J, so exp(-β*(-3J))=exp(3J β).

So two terms of exp(3J β).

Case 2: Sum = 1. How many states have A+B+C=1?

A, B, C can be +1 or -1, and their sum is 1. So possible counts: two of them are +1, one is -1. Because 2*(+1) + (-1) = +1.

So how many combinations are there where two are +1 and one is -1?

There are C(3,2)=3 ways to choose which two are +1 and which one is -1. So three possibilities for the sum being +1.

Each such possibility corresponds to certain spin states. Wait, but each of these cases may correspond to different spin configurations.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible spin configurations and count how many have each sum.

Wait, another approach: the sum S = A+B+C.

Each A, B, C is S_i S_j. So for each spin configuration, compute S.

Alternatively, since there are 8 possible spin states, maybe it's manageable to compute E for each.

Let me list all possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1

Compute A=S1S2=1, B=S1S3=1, C=S2S3=1 → sum=3 → E= -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1

A=1, B= -1 (S1=+1, S3=-1), C= S2S3= -1 → sum = 1-1-1 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, E= -J*(sum), so sum is -1 → E = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1

A= (1)(-1)= -1, B= (1)(1)=1, C= (-1)(1)= -1 → sum= -1+1-1= -1 → E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1

A = (-1), B= (-1), C= (1) → sum= -1-1+1= -1 → E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1

A = (-1)(+1)= -1, B= (-1)(+1)= -1, C= (+1)(+1)=1 → sum= -1-1+1= -1 → E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1

A = (-1)(+1)= -1, B= (-1)(-1)=1, C= (+1)(-1)= -1 → sum= -1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1

A=(-1)(-1)=1, B= (-1)(+1)= -1, C= (-1)(+1)= -1 → sum=1-1-1= -1 → E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

A=1, B=1, C=1 → sum=3 → E= -3J.

Wait, looking at this, the first state (all +1) and last state (all -1) have E=-3J, contributing two terms.

The other six states have E= J. So that's six terms of exp(-βE) = exp(-β J).

Wait, but wait, when E is J, exp(-β E) is exp(-β J). But looking at the energy calculation, for the second state, E was J. So each of these six contributes e^{-β J}.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-β E}.

So Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * e^{3 J β} + (number of states with E=J) * e^{-J β}.

Because for E=-3J, e^{-β E} = e^{3 J β}.

From the counts:

Number of states with E=-3J: 2 (states 1 and 8).

Number of states with E= J: 6 (states 2-7).

So Z = 2 e^{3 J β} + 6 e^{- J β}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, signs are opposite.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, this matches what I have.

Option C: 2 e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No, exponents are different.

Option D:6 e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Wait, but wait, my calculation says the exponents are 3Jβ and -Jβ. So option B is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin configurations, we enumerate all states, compute their energies, and sum the corresponding Boltzmann factors.

### Step 1: Possible Energies
The energy depends on the sum \( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), where each term \( S_1S_2, S_1S_3, S_2S_3 \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The possible values of \( S \) are \( -3, -1, +1, +3 \), corresponding to the energy values:

\[
E = -J \cdot S.
\]

### Step 2: Counting States for Each Energy
- **For \( S = 3 \):** All three spin pairs are \( +1 \), which occurs in two states: \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) = (+1, +1, +1) \) and \( (-1, -1, -1) \). Thus, there are \( 2 \) states with \( E = -3J \).
- **For \( S = -3 \):** All three spin pairs are \( -1 \), which is impossible because it would require all spins to be both \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) simultaneously. Thus, there are \( 0 \) states with \( S = -3 \).
- **For \( S = 1 \):** Two spin pairs are \( +1 \), and one is \( -1 \). There are \( 3 \) such combinations, corresponding to \( 6 \) states (since each combination can occur in two ways depending on the spin values). Thus, there are \( 6 \) states with \( E = J \).
- **For \( S = -1 \):** Two spin pairs are \( -1 \), and one is \( +1 \). Similarly, there are \( 3 \) such combinations, corresponding to \( 6 \) states. Thus, there are \( 6 \) states with \( E = -J \).

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function is the sum of \( e^{-\beta E} \) over all states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

- For \( E = -3J \): Each of the \( 2 \) states contributes \( e^{3J\beta} \), giving \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
- For \( E = J \): Each of the \( 6 \) states contributes \( e^{-J\beta} \), giving \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:

- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, exponents are different).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, exponents and coefficients are different).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
