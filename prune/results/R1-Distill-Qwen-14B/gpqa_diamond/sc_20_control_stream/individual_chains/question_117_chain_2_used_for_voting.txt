Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four moieties, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. Let's look at each one.

1. The first is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the rings being in different positions. Wait, but biphenyls can have either a trans or cis configuration, but wait, are those stereoisomers? Oh, wait, biphenyls can have different diastereomers based on the rotation of the rings around the central bond. But are they chiral? Hmm, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe it can have optical isomers. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound. Let me think. If the two nitro groups are on opposite or same sides, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Wait, the substituents are at 6 and 6' positions, and 2 and 2' positions. Hmm, but the central bond can rotate. So, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the molecule can't exist as a meso form. Alternatively, since it's a biphenyl with substituents on both rings, perhaps it can have enantiomers. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to come back to this after analyzing the others.

2. Next is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the carbon chain is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that would be: the central carbon is the hydroxy group. Let me see: the central carbon is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and what else? Wait, the three carbons are: the first is CH3, the second is the one with OH, and the third is COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second one) is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COO-. So the structure is methyl ester: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, maybe I should think again. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but the central carbon is the one with OH. Let me think: the molecule would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is: 

Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, wait, no: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, that's not right because the middle carbon is attached to CH3 (from propanoate), but wait, no, wait. I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me think of the formula as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure would be:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: so the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2COOCH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Oh, because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with the OH on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH2-OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think of the formula as the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COO-. So the ester would have the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So that's the structure. Now, looking at the central carbon (the one with OH): it's attached to what? Let's see: the OH is on the second carbon. The groups attached are: CH3 (from the first carbon), COOCH3 (from the third), and two other groups? Wait, the central carbon is connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and what else? Oh, wait, the central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- One OH,
- One COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- And one CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The structure is:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. When it forms the ester, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait, no. No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with an OCH3. So the ester is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoate, no? Because the COO is on the end. Wait, no. Let me number the carbons. The propanoate ion is CH2CH2COO-. So the three carbons are 1, 2, 3, with 3 being the COO- group. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on carbon 2, which is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: CH2 (from carbon 1, which is CH3?), no. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual structure: the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- One CH3 (from the first carbon, if it's CH2 connected to CH3 on one side and CH2 to the other? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with OH, attached to CH3, COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's a secondary carbon with four different groups. Let me see: the central carbon is CH(OH). The groups attached are CH3, COOCH3, two CH2 groups? No, wait, perhaps the groups are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2 group. Wait, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2 group that's connected to the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I should think about whether this carbon is a chiral center.

Wait, in CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (on one side),
- COOCH3 (on the other),
- OH,
- And the next carbon, which is the COOCH3's carbon. Wait, no. Let me imagine the molecule:

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the adjacent carbon, which is the one from COOCH3. Wait, that's getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to the following four groups:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's attached to two CH2 groups, making it a secondary carbon, not a chiral center. Wait, no, because if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central CH is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen? No, wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, so the CH(OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group? Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the central carbon is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. So in this case, the groups would be:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- an ester group (COOCH3),
- an OH group,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another H. Wait, but if that's the case, then it's only three different groups, making it not a chiral center. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH(OH). Let's see:

- Two CH3 groups? No, wait, look:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- A CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- A COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- An OH group,
- And a hydrogen? Because it's CH(OH), so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the central carbon is CH(OH), but if the central carbon is CH(OH), then it's attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. So that's four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Wait no, wait, if the central carbon is CH(OH), then it's connected to:

- One CH3 (from the left),
- One COOCH3 (from the right),
- An OH,
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- And a hydrogen. So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center, which means it can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 would show optical activity.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. Its structure is two benzene rings connected via a ketone group. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. Now, does this compound have any chiral centers? Let's see. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The two phenyl groups are attached to the same carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. So, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it cannot have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate has two double bonds. The structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, wait: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when it forms the dimethyl ester, it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, this molecule has a double bond, but does it have any stereocenters?

Wait, the double bond in fumarate is between the two CH groups. So the structure is CH2=CH. Wait, no, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two carbons, each attached to two oxygen atoms. So it's O=C-(CH2? Or O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, wait, let me think. Fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dioic acid. So the structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. No, fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. So the structure is:

O
|| 
O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O 
O

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → wait, no. Oh, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the structure is a four-carbon chain, with a double bond between the second and third carbons. So the dimethyl ester would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Now, looking at this structure, the double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of these carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O
O

No, wait, no. Let me correct this. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but with a double bond between the two central carbons. So it's O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but the double bond is between CH2 and CH2, making it O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O → but that can't be right because that would be a single bond. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure as:

The molecule is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O → no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH=CH-C=O. So the structure is O=C-CH=CH-C=O, but that's not possible because you can't have two double bonds adjacent like that. Oh wait, no, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O with a double bond? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH=CH-C=O. But that would require a conjugated system. Wait, perhaps I should think of fumarate as having a double bond between the two central carbons, each attached to a carbonyl group. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O 
O

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of fumarate as having two double bonds. Wait, no, fumarate has one double bond. The structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to a carbonyl group. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O → no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the central part is CH=CH, each connected to a COOCH3 group. Now, each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3. Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each end is a methyl ester of a carboxylic acid. So the structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3. So it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the CH2-CH2 group. No, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any stereocenters. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So in the molecule, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So in meso compounds, even though there are stereocenters, they are present in such a way that the molecule is achiral. So dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, meaning it doesn't have optical isomerism because the stereocenters are in a symmetrical arrangement, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So in the molecule, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to two identical groups. Let me imagine the structure: each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and an OCH3 group? No, wait, no. Let me think: each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, that's not right. Alternatively, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group from the ester.

Wait, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. Hmm, but then each would have the same groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So for each CH in the double bond, the groups are COOCH3 and CH3 (from the other end). Wait, but that would make each carbon in the double bond attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, making them identical. So the molecule is symmetrical, so it's a meso compound. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism. So option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to visualize it. If the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to two COOCH3 groups, then it's symmetric. But wait, no, because each carbon in the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups, making them identical. But that's not the case for fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and another substituent. Wait, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and a methyl group from the ester. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH3OOC group. Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. But then the structure would be CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that's not possible because that would require the double bond to be between two CH2 groups, which would have two substituents each.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. So the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 → but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So the structure is CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 → but that can't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's CH3-OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. In this structure, each carbon in the double bond (the two CH groups) is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. So each of those carbons would have the same groups attached, making them identical. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, and hence a meso compound, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Let's think about whether the molecule has stereocenters. If a molecule has stereocenters but is achiral (like a meso compound), then it doesn't have optical isomers. So fumarate would have two stereocenters, but they are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Now, back to the options. Let me recap:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have cis and trans arrangements, but are they chiral? Let me think: the molecule has two substituents on each ring. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents are on opposite sides, it might have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, the molecule is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2,2' (dicarboxylate) and 6,6' (dinitro). So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. Let me imagine the structure. If the two rings are connected, each has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The positions 2 and 6 are on opposite sides of the biphenyl. So, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, if the substituents are on the same side, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But if they're on opposite sides, it could be chiral. Let me think about the positions. In biphenyl, the positions are numbered such that position 2 is para to position 6 (since in a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to the next ring). So 2 would be adjacent to 1, and 6 would be two positions away from 1. So in the biphenyl structure, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be on opposite sides relative to the central bond. So perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups and the carboxylate groups are arranged in a way that a chiral center is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, so it's achiral despite having stereocenters.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't a meso compound. Let me think: the substituents at 6 and 6' are nitro groups, and at 2 and 2' are carboxylate groups. If the arrangement of these groups leads to the molecule lacking a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. So perhaps this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to summarize:

1. Could be, but I'm not completely sure. Maybe it's chiral.

2. Definitely has a chiral center, so yes.

4. Dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so no.

So, looking back at the options:

Which compounds show optical isomerism?

- 1: unsure, but perhaps yes.
- 2: yes.
- 4: no.

Wait, but in the options, the choices are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → but 4 is no, so A is wrong.

B) 3 and 4 → both no, so B is wrong.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no → C is wrong.

D) 1 and 2 → 2 yes, 1 I'm unsure. So possible.

Alternatively, perhaps option 1 is no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether biphenyl compounds can have optical isomerism. Biphenyls can have axial chirality, which refers to the arrangement around the central bond. If the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it can have optical isomers. For example, if the substituents are in a trans configuration relative to each other, the molecule might be chiral.

In the case of 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The substituents at 2 and 2' are the carboxylate groups, and at 6 and 6' are the nitro groups. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides (trans) relative to the central bond, and the same for the carboxylate groups, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and hence capable of optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is not chiral. But given that the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions, which are meta to each other on the benzene ring, perhaps the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry.

I think that 1 is a chiral molecule, so it would show optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2. So the correct options are 1 and 2, which is option A) 1, 2 and 4 (no, because 4 is no), or option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 4 is no.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 is no.

D) 1 and 2 → yes, both have optical isomerism.

So the correct answer would be option A if 4 is yes, but earlier analysis says 4 is no. So looking back, option A includes 4, which is no. So option D is 1 and 2, which are both yes.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 is a meso compound and doesn't have optical isomerism. So the answer is option D, which includes 1 and 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain about 1. Let me think again.

In the biphenyl structure, 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

The question is whether this arrangement leads to the molecule being chiral.

If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

So, for example, if the two nitro groups are on opposite sides (trans) relative to the central bond, and the two carboxylate groups are also on opposite sides, then the molecule would have a chiral arrangement.

But if the nitro groups are on the same side and the carboxylates are on the same side, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 2 positions. Let me imagine the biphenyl: the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, on each ring, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and position 6 is two positions away from 1.

So, in each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Now, on each ring, the 2 and 6 positions are adjacent to each other in a way that their substituents could be in a trans arrangement relative to the central bond.

If the two nitro groups are on opposite sides (trans) and the two carboxylate groups are also trans, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, it would not be chiral.

But without knowing the exact substituent positions, it's hard to say. However, given that both rings have two substituents each, and the positions are such that they're not symmetrically opposite, I think that the molecule is chiral and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. Yes.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. Looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality, which are necessary for a compound to rotate plane-polarized light.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions. The arrangement of the substituents (nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate groups at 2) can lead to a lack of symmetry in the molecule. If the substituents are not arranged symmetrically, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism. Thus, this compound shows optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, so the molecule can exist as enantiomers and exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not serve as a chiral center. The molecule is symmetrical, so it does not have any chiral centers or axial chirality. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The double bond in fumarate is in the trans (E) configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters, so dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)** and **2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**. 

ANSWER: D
