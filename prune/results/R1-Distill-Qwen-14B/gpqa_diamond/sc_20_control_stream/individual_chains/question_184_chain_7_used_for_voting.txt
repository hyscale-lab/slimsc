Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are important. Let's number the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions relative to each other. That makes it a meta arrangement for some of them, but I think the exact arrangement depends on the order of substitution.

Since benzene is symmetric, the order in which we introduce the substituents will determine the positions. I remember that when substituents are introduced via electrophilic substitution, the directing effect of the existing groups will influence where the next group goes.

Let me think about the substituents. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via the lone pairs of oxygen), but nitro is a deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group which is meta-directing. The tert-butyl group is a big, bulky substituent. Since it's an alkyl group, it's activating and ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but the order of substitution matters a lot. Let me plan the steps.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about which substituent to add first. If I add the nitro group first, that's a strong meta director. Then, adding ethoxy next would be influenced by the nitro group. Alternatively, if I add ethoxy first, which is activating, then the next substitution would be directed by ethoxy.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering the ring, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2.

Hmm, perhaps the substitution order should be such that each new substituent is added in a position that's ortho or para to the existing groups, considering their directing effects.

Let me break it down:

1. Suppose we first add the ethoxy group. Ethoxy is an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Then, adding the next group (let's say nitro) would go into a position relative to ethoxy. But since nitro is meta-directing, but when introduced into a ring with an activating group, nitro would be added where?

Wait, no. When you have multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on which group is more activating. The more activating groups are usually the ones that direct. Wait, but nitro is deactivating. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. Let me consider that.

If I first nitrate benzene, I'll get nitrobenzene, which is meta-directing. Then, adding ethoxy group next. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. To add ethoxy, which is a strong activating group, maybe it's better to introduce ethoxy first.

Wait, perhaps I should plan the substituents in an order that allows each subsequent substitution to be correctly positioned.

Another approach is to consider the directing effects for each step.

Let me think about each substituent's effect:

- Ethoxy (-OEt): activating, ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl: bulky, activating (since it's an alkyl group), ortho/para director but bulky so might favor para if possible due to steric hindrance.
- Nitro (-NO2): deactivating, meta director.

So the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, so the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So it's adjacent positions: 1 and 2 are ortho to each other, 2 and 3 are also adjacent. Hmm, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that each is adjacent to the next.

Wait, maybe the order of substitution is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Let me imagine:

1. Benzene first gets ethoxy group. So we have ethoxybenzene. Since ethoxy is activating, the next substitution (tert-butyl) would go into ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy.

If we do Friedel-Crafts alkylation for tert-butyl, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides. Oh wait, the first step in option A is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Wait but Friedel-Crafts is for activating rings, since they require the ring to be activated to generate the carbocation.

So if ethoxy is already present, which is activating, the next substitution can be via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically adds an alkyl group, but sometimes can have issues like carbocation rearrangements. But in this case, tert-butyl is a bulky group, so perhaps it's added via Friedel-Crafts, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. If I first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl in an ortho position, and then nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl. Let me think.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene (step i: HNO3/H2SO4). Then, nitro is a meta director. Next, perhaps I introduce ethoxy. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but ethoxy can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution? Wait, no. Ethoxy is an activating group, but you can't just substitute it directly. Wait, perhaps through an etherification reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps adding ethoxy via a substitution. But benzene is not nucleophilic. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation is not possible because it's an activating group, but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding the substituents in a way that each new group is added in the correct position based on the directing effects of the existing groups.

Let me think of the target molecule. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl in the ortho position, then nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but then the nitro group would be added where? Let me draw this mentally.

Ethoxy is at position 1. Adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would preferably go to ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). Since the target has tert-butyl at position 2, that's ortho to ethoxy. So that would make sense.

Once ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, where would the nitro group go? The next substituent, nitro, is a meta director. But the existing groups are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). But nitro is deactivating, so when adding nitro, the directing effect would be meta to which group?

Wait, maybe not. Because nitro is a deactivating group, perhaps it's better added earlier in the synthesis.

Wait, let me think again. Let's plan the substitution steps.

Option 1:

1. Introduce ethoxy group. Let's say Friedel-Crafts isn't possible because benzene is not easily alkylated. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires a Lewis acid catalyst and an alkyl halide. Wait, but ethoxy is an ether, which is not an alkyl group. So perhaps ethoxy is introduced via another method, like nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually difficult unless the ring is activated.

Wait, another thought: ethoxy group could be introduced via a substitution reaction, but in benzene, that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, which can be done using an alkyl halide and a base, but I'm not quite remembering the exact steps.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like using an electrophilic substitution with an ethyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again. Each option represents a sequence of reactions. Perhaps I can look for the correct order of substituent additions.

Looking at the target structure: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are arranged as follows: ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl is next to it at 2, and nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last, and its position is influenced by the existing substituents.

Let me think of the order in which substituents are added.

If I first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro, each time considering the directing effects.

First, adding ethoxy. Then, when adding tert-butyl, it goes ortho (position 2) because ethoxy is activating and ortho/para-directing. Then, when adding nitro, the existing substituents (ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2) will direct the nitro group.

Wait, but ethoxy is activating (ortho/para) and tert-butyl is activating (ortho/para), but nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So when adding nitro, where would it go?

The positions available on the ring would be positions 3,4,5,6. Ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

So, the ring now has substituents at 1 and 2. The next substituent (nitro) would be influenced by the existing groups.

Ethoxy (1) is activating and directs incoming groups to ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4). But position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl. So, the possible positions for nitro are 4 and 6, but also considering the directing effect of the tert-butyl group.

The tert-butyl group at 2 is bulky and ortho/para-directing. So, it would direct to positions 1 (already taken by ethoxy), 3 (ortho), and 6 (para).

Wait, no. The tert-butyl is at 2. Ortho positions would be 1 and 3. Para would be 6.

So, when adding nitro, the existing groups (ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2) would direct the incoming nitro group. But since nitro is a meta director, but nitro is a deactivating group, the existing groups would influence where it goes.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that's meta to one substituent and influenced by another. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So, if the ring already has two substituents, the incoming nitro group would go where the directing effects of the existing groups point it.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the tert-butyl, but that might complicate things.

Let me think of the steps each option provides and see which sequence would lead to the correct substitution.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that's a long sequence, but I'm a bit confused. Let me go step by step.

Option A:

1. i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

But wait, benzene with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 would give tert-butylbenzene. Then, step ii is nitrating. So we have tert-butylbenzene nitrated.

Wait, tert-butyl is an activating group. So when nitrated, where would the nitro group go? The tert-butyl group is ortho/para-directing.

So the nitro would go to either ortho (position 2 or 4) or para (position 5) relative to tert-butyl. But after adding nitro, we have another substituent.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about each step.

Option A:

i) benzene + tert-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene

ii) nitration → nitrated tert-butylbenzene. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para-directing, the nitro group could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Wait, but position 2 is adjacent to the tert-butyl group. So after nitration, we have either meta, ortho, or para.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3 relative to ethoxy, which is position 1. Hmm.

Wait, but this might not align. Let me proceed.

Step iii) SO3/H2SO4. That's sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. But wait, why would that be done? That would add another substituent, which complicates things.

Hmm, perhaps option A is not the right path. Let me look at option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction. Wait, Fe/HCl is typically used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene becomes aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, but Friedel-Crafts can't be done on aniline because the ring is too activated, leading to carbocation rearrangements and possible over-alkylation. Plus, aniline is a strong activating group, so alkylation would be difficult here.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the order is wrong. First nitrate, then add t-butyl, but the Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because nitro is deactivating.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think of another approach.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, adding a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Wait, but that would add another substituent. Not sure if that's the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Because ethoxy is activating, and tert-butyl can be added via Friedel-Crafts. Then nitro would be added in the correct position.

Wait, but how do I add ethoxy to benzene? Friedel-Crafts doesn't work for ethers. Oh wait, perhaps I can use an etherification, but I'm not certain.

Wait, ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. Alternatively, maybe using an electrophilic approach. So perhaps using an ethyl halide with a strong catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using a directing group to install the ethoxy group. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution after nitration, but that might require a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SN2 reaction, but it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been activated. For example, using a nitration step, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's typically for alkyl groups, not ethers. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts can introduce alky groups, not ethers. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via another method, such as using an ethyl halide in a different way.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which sequence correctly adds substituents in the order that would lead to the target.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group in the ortho position to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

But how to do each step.

Adding ethoxy: Maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's hard unless the ring is activated. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl group via some other method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an etherification reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an electrophilic substitution using an ethyl electrophile, but I can't think of a direct method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration step, but that might require a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in the options.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro group added. Since tert-butyl is activating, nitro would add ortho or para to it.

So, nitro can go to ortho (position 2), which is adjacent to the tert-butyl group at position 1.

Wait, but position 2 is where the target has the tert-butyl, which is position 2 in the target. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So in option B, after step i and ii, we have tert-butyl at 1 and nitro at 2.

Then step iii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So now we have aniline and tert-butyl group.

Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again? That seems odd because aniline is a strong activating group, so nitrating would add nitro in the ortho or para positions relative to amino.

But in the target, there's only one nitro group. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Option C: Let's see.

i) t-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate group added.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce sulfonate? No, sulfonate is a strong activating group but I don't think Fe/HCl would remove it.

Hmm, not sure.

Option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts? But aniline is a strong activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would be difficult due to carbocation rearrangement or over-reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the t-butyl is added via some other method, like a coupling reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitro group being added last. Because in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (t-butyl). So, perhaps the nitro is added after the t-butyl and ethoxy groups.

Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene.

2. Add tert-butyl group in the ortho position to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy (which would be position 3).

So, order: ethoxy → tert-butyl → nitro.

But how to add the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a benzene ring that's been treated to have a leaving group, but that's perhaps too complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation after a nitration and then some steps.

Wait, perhaps we can first nitrate benzene, then do something to introduce ethoxy and t-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is nitration, then t-butyl addition, then ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group first. Let's say we nitrate benzene, getting nitrobenzene. Then, add ethoxy in a position meta to the nitro.

Wait, nitro is meta director, so adding ethoxy would go into the meta position. Then, adding t-butyl in the ortho to ethoxy.

Let me see:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce ethoxy in the meta position relative to nitro → ethoxy at position 3 (if nitro is at 1).

Wait, but in the target, nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1. So perhaps nitro is added first.

Wait, let me think of the target's substituents: ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, if nitro is at 3, and ethoxy at 1, that's adjacent, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are added in the order of t-butyl, ethoxy, nitro.

Wait, no, but if t-butyl is added first, then ethoxy would go ortho or para to it. Then nitro would be added in a position influenced by both.

But I'm getting stuck.

Another approach: let's look for the correct order of substituents in the options and see which one would give the desired positions.

The target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about the directing effects.

Suppose the first substituent is ethoxy. Then, the ring is activated, so the next substituent (t-butyl) would go ortho or para. Let's say ortho (position 2). Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2. The next substituent is nitro, which is deactivating.

When adding nitro, the existing groups are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-butyl (activating, ortho/para). But nitro is a deactivating, meta director. Wait, no: the nitro group is being added as the substituent, so the existing groups will direct where the nitro goes.

Wait, wait. When adding nitro, the existing groups (ethoxy and t-butyl) are activating, so they will direct the nitro to their ortho or para positions.

The ethoxy is at 1, so its ortho are 2 and 6, and para is 4.

t-butyl is at 2, so its ortho are 1 and 3, and para is 6.

So, when adding nitro, the possible positions are 3 (ortho to t-butyl), 4 (para to ethoxy), and 6 (ortho to ethoxy and para to t-butyl). But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl at 2.

So, the nitro would go to position 3, which is ortho to t-butyl. That makes sense.

So the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene.

2. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts in the ortho position (position 2).

3. Add nitro in the ortho position relative to t-butyl (position 3).

So, what reactions are needed for each step.

First, adding ethoxy. How? Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't suitable for adding an ether group. So perhaps another method.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's tricky. Alternatively, maybe using an electrophilic substitution with an ethyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introducing a good leaving group, then substituting it with ethoxy. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps introducing the ethoxy group via a benzene ring with a directing group that allows it to be added in a specific position.

Wait, perhaps using a benzene ring with a substituent that directs the incoming ethoxy group to the correct position.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a two-step process, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options again and see which one adds the substituents in the correct order.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added. The t-butyl is an activating group, so nitro goes ortho or para. If nitro is added in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl at 2.

Wait, but after adding t-butyl at position 1 (if benzene is treated with tert-butyl chloride), then nitrating would add nitro in positions 2,4,5, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after nitration. Wait, but in the target, nitro is a substituent that's meta to ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-butyl.

No, because tert-butyl is bulky and may require Friedel-Crafts, which requires an activated ring. Nitration would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Hmm. This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about the steps in each option and see if any lead to the desired product.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But aniline is a strong activating group, which may direct the t-butyl to ortho or para. But Friedel-Crafts may not work well because aniline's strong activating effect can lead to over-reaction or carbocation rearrangements.

Alternatively, perhaps after reducing to aniline, the next step is to introduce t-butyl via some other method.

But I'm not sure.

Option C:

i) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate group added. Sulfonic acid groups are strong activating, ortho/para directors.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate. So nitro would add ortho or para to sulfonic acid.

Hmm, but the target has no sulfonic acid group, so this option may not be correct.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride → t-butylbenzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe to a carboxylic acid.

But the target doesn't have a nitro group in that position, so perhaps this is incorrect.

Option A:

The steps involve multiple nitration, sulfonation, etc. But the target has three substituents, so perhaps it's adding all three.

Wait, but the target has exactly three substituents. So perhaps the correct option is the one that adds each substituent in the correct order, leading to the target structure.

Wait, let me try to think of the steps in option B.

Option B's steps:

1. t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration → nitro added, probably ortho or para to t-butyl.

Assuming nitro is added at position 3 (adjacent to t-butyl at 2).

3. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So now, the ring has t-butyl at 2 and amine at 3.

4. HNO3 → nitrate again. But with aniline (activating) present, the nitro would go ortho or para to amine, but the ring is getting crowded.

But in the target, there's only one nitro group. So this doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Let me think of the correct synthesis steps.

Maybe the correct approach is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl group added in ortho or para to amine.

But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would add t-butyl in ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

If the amine is at position 1, t-butyl would go to 2 or 4.

But in the target, t-butyl is at 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. So maybe after adding t-butyl at 4, but that complicates.

Alternatively, perhaps:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene.

2. Nitrate to add nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

3. Add t-butyl in the ortho position relative to ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add ethoxy, then add t-butyl, then add nitro.

But again, the challenge is adding ethoxy to benzene.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Add ethoxy via an electrophilic substitution using an ethyl group, but I don't think that's standard.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has been alkylated with a leaving group, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps looking at each option's steps:

The target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. Let's look for a sequence that adds all three.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → adds t-butyl either ortho (position 2 or 6) or para (position 4) to the amine.

Assuming ortho, t-butyl at position 2.

iv) HNO3 → nitrates again, but aniline is activating, so nitro would go ortho/para to amine, which is at position 1.

But in target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy.

Hmm. Not matching.

Option C:

i) t-butyl → position 1.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate at position 3.

iii) HNO3 → nitro added ortho/para to sulfonate.

But target doesn't have sulfonate.

So, perhaps none of the options match, but one must be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, let me go back. The target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the substituents are in a row: 1,2,3.

So, perhaps the order is:

- Add ethoxy at 1.

- Add t-butyl at 2, ortho to ethoxy.

- Add nitro at 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

Add t-butyl first, then ethoxy in ortho, then nitro in meta relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the steps.

Another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves using a protecting group or some activating/deactivating steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the options, especially looking for the correct order of substituents.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduction → amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl at position 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) Nitration → could add nitro at position 3 (meta to amine), but the target has only one nitro group.

No, that doesn't fit.

Option B steps:

i) t-butyl → position 1.

ii) Nitration → nitro at position 2.

iii) Reduction → amine at 2.

iv) Nitration → nitro at position 3.

But that would imply two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration → nitro added ortho to t-butyl (position 2), giving nitro at 2.

Wait, but that would make the structure t-butyl at 1 and nitro at 2.

3. Then, add ethoxy via some method, but I'm not sure.

But the target has ethoxy at 1, which is a position that's already taken by t-butyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The order of substitution is critical because each substituent influences the position of the next due to its electronic and steric effects.

### Key Analysis of the Substituents:
1. **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
2. **Tert-butyl**: Activating, bulky, ortho/para-directing but favors para due to steric hindrance.
3. **Nitro (-NO2)**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

### Target Structure:
- Ethoxy at position 1.
- Tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).
- Nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl).

### Challenges:
- Introducing the ethoxy group directly to benzene is challenging because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work for ethers. Alternative methods, such as nucleophilic aromatic substitution, are difficult unless the ring is activated.
- The sequence must ensure that each substituent is added in the correct position, considering the directing effects of the existing groups.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A**:
1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds a tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. Nitration adds a nitro group, which would likely go ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
3. Subsequent steps (sulfonation, diazotization, etc.) complicate the synthesis and do not align with the target structure.
- **Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds a tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho to the tert-butyl group.
3. Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
4. Further nitration and subsequent steps do not align with the target structure, as the nitro group would not end up at position 3.
- **Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds a tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target structure.
3. Nitration and subsequent steps introduce additional substituents that do not match the target.
- **Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
2. Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds a tert-butyl group, which would likely go ortho or para to the amine.
4. Subsequent nitration and steps do not align with the target structure, as the nitro group would not end up at position 3.
- **Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

### Final Answer:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the reasoning and the closest alignment to the target, **Option B** is selected as the most plausible answer.

**Answer: B**
