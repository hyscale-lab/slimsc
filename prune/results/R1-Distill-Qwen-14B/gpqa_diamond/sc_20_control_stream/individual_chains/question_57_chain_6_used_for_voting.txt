Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given data is the phase shifts at different angular momenta, delta_0 to delta_4, each with their respective values. Oh wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, but as given, we have up to delta_4.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(k, k', theta) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over all angular momentum states, each contributing a term with the phase shift.

Wait, right, the general form is something like f(theta) equals (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to infinity of (2l +1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) * (Pl(cos theta)), where Pl is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the imaginary part is what we're after, and along the incident direction, which is theta = 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam direction is along the initial direction, so when you scatter, theta is the angle between the initial and final directions.

Wait, no, wait. The incident beam direction is when theta is zero. Because theta is the scattering angle, measured from the direction of the incoming particle. So when the electron scatters in the same direction, theta is zero. So we need to compute f(theta=0) and find its imaginary part.

The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l (cosθ)

But wait, I think I might have that 1/(2ik) factor wrong. Wait, perhaps it's (1/k) times the sum, because each term has (2l+1) times something. Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) ∑ (2l + 1) [e^{i δ_l} - 1] P_l (cosθ). Because when you expand e^{iδ} as cosδ + i sinδ, subtracting 1 would give i sinδ + (cosδ -1), but when you're taking the imaginary part, the real parts might not contribute in some terms.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f(theta) along the incident direction, which is theta=0. So I can plug theta=0 into the expression.

Let me think again. The formula for f is:

f(θ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But each P_l(1), since cos(0)=1. What's the value of P_l(1) for different l? The Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are just 1 for all l. Because P_l(1)=1 for any l. So when θ=0, cosθ=1, so each P_l is 1.

So f(theta=0) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)[ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ]

But we can split this into real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im[e^{i δ_l} -1 ].

What's Im[e^{i δ_l} - 1 ]? Let's compute it. e^{i δ} is cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{i δ} -1 = (cosδ -1) + i sin δ. The imaginary part is sin δ. So the imaginary part of f(theta=0) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part Im f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin δ_l, since higher l phase shifts are ignored (as per the question: "Ignore rest of the phase shifts.").

Wait, but the given phase shifts are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. So l runs from 0 to 4, because delta_0 is l=0, delta_1 is l=1, etc.

So let me compute each term (2l+1) * sin(δ_l), sum them up, then multiply by 1/k.

Wait, but what is k? The wave number. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. So we need to find k, the wave number, in appropriate units.

Hmm, the relation between the kinetic energy and the wave number. For non-relativistic particles, k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But electrons with 50 MeV are relativistic, right? Because 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. So we need to use relativistic expressions.

Wait, but wait, in scattering experiments involving electrons, sometimes the relation is approximated using the relativistic formula. The energy E is given as 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so E ≈ pc, where p is the momentum. So p = E / c. But wait, for high energies, E = pc. So E = pc → p = E/(c). Then, the wave number k is p/ħ. So k = E/(ħ c).

Wait, let me think again. The relativistic relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. For E much larger than m c², E ≈ pc. So pc ≈ E → p ≈ E/(c). So the momentum p is approximately E/(c). But I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, but in particle physics, units are often in terms where ħ c is about 197 MeV fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters). So, for the electron's momentum, p = E/(c) → but in units where ħ c = 197 MeV fm, so p = E/(c) → but perhaps more accurately, p (in units of MeV/c) is E/(c^2) * c = E/(c). But I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here.

Let me try to compute k in terms of MeV.

The wave number k is given by k = p/ħ, where p is the momentum. Since E = γ m c², and for high energies, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.

But ħ in units of MeV·fm is approximately 197 MeV·fm. Because 197 MeV fm is about ħ c. So let me compute k.

p = E/(c) → but in units where c=1 (as in natural units), this is p = E. So p = 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c is about 197 MeV fm.

So k = p / ħ → but p is in units of MeV/c. So k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c / (MeV fm)) ) → let's see.

Alternatively, since ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) is approximately 1/(197 MeV·fm). So p = E/c = 50 MeV/c.

So k = p/(ħ) → [50 MeV/c ] / [ ħ ] → but ħ is in units of MeV·fm / c. Wait, perhaps a better approach: express ħ c as 197 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197 MeV·fm)/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (E/c) / ( (197 MeV fm)/c ) ) → the c's cancel, so k = E / (197 MeV fm) → E is 50 MeV. So k = 50 / 197 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so k ≈ 50 / 197 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈ 197 / 50 ≈ 3.94 fm.

Wait, but let me compute 50 / 197: 197 is about 200, so 50/200 is 0.25. So 0.253 is a better approximation.

So 1/k is approximately 3.94 fm.

But perhaps I should compute it more precisely:

50 / 197 = approximately 0.2533. So 1/k = 197/50 = 3.94.

So k ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k = 3.94 fm.

Now, let's compute the sum for each l from 0 to 4:

Each term is (2l+1) * sin(delta_l degrees).

First, convert all delta_l degrees to radians, because the sine function in calculations is usually in radians. Alternatively, just compute the sine in degrees. Let me note down each term.

l=0: delta=90°, so sin(90)=1. (2*0+1)=1 → term is 1*1=1.

l=1: delta=67°. sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205. (2*1+1)=3 → 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: delta=55°. sin(55)≈0.8192. (2*2+1)=5 → 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3: delta=30°. sin(30)=0.5. (2*3+1)=7 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: delta=13°. sin(13°) ≈0.22495. (2*4+1)=9 →9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.38205.

Then, Im f = (1/k) * sum → (1/k) is about 3.94 fm.

So Im f ≈ 3.94 * 13.38205 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

3.94 *13.38205.

3 *13.38205=40.14615.

0.94 *13.38205: 0.9 *13.38205=12.043845, 0.04 *13.38205=0.535282 → total 12.579127.

So total is 40.14615 +12.579127 ≈52.725277.

Wait, but wait, 3.94 *13.38205=?

Wait, 3.94 *13 is 51.22 → 3.94 *0.38205 ≈ 1.507. So 51.22 +1.507=52.727.

Approximately 52.727 fm.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, none of these are near 52.7 fm. Hmm, so that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for k. Let me recheck that.

Electron energy E=50 MeV.

In relativistic terms, the momentum p can be found from E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but when E >> m c², E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c^2) * c = E/(c) → p ≈ E/(c).

Wait, but the units here might be tricky. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

But p in natural units is E/c (since E = pc for high energy). So p = E/(c) = (50 MeV) / (c) → but in terms of units where ħ c is in MeV·fm, I can write it as:

k = (E / c ) / ħ = (50 MeV / c ) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ) )

The c's cancel, so denominator is (197.33 MeV·fm ), numerator is 50 MeV.

So k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k = 197.33 /50 = 3.9466 fm.

So that part seems correct.

Now, sum of (2l+1) * sin(delta_l) is:

l=0: 1*1 =1 → 1

l=1:3 * sin(67) → sin(67)= approx 0.9205 → 3*0.9205=2.7615 → total so far 3.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) → sin(55)=0.8192 → 5*0.8192=4.096 → total 7.8575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5 → total 11.3575.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*.22495≈2.02455 → total 13.38205.

So sum is about 13.382.

Multiply by 1/k (3.9466 fm):

13.382 * 3.9466 ≈ ?

Let me calculate this more accurately.

13.382 *3 =40.146

13.382 *0.9466= ?

0.9 *13.382=12.0438

0.04 *13.382=0.53528

0.0066 *13.382≈0.088

So 12.0438 +0.53528=12.57908 +0.088=12.66708.

Total is 40.146 +12.66708≈52.813.

Wait, about 52.813 fm.

But the options are way larger than that.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor. Maybe the formula I used is incorrect.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l), but perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length. So, perhaps the imaginary part is in fm, which matches the options.

Wait, wait, but the sum is about 13.38, times 3.9466 fm gives about 52.8 fm. But none of the options are 52.8. Hmm.

Looking at the options: option C is 177.675 fm, which is roughly 3.37 times the 52.8. Hmm, that's near 3.375, which is 27/8 = 3.375. Or perhaps I messed up the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute each term with more precise sine values.

Compute each (2l+1)*sin(delta_l):

l=0, delta=90: sin(90)=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1, delta=67: sin(67) = let's calculate it accurately. 67 degrees.

Using calculator, sin(67)= approx 0.9205048534.

So term=3 * 0.9205048534 ≈ 2.76151456 → 2.76151456.

l=2, delta=55: sin(55) ≈ 0.8191520443.

Term=5 * 0.8191520443≈4.09576022.

l=3, delta=30: sin(30)=0.5 → 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4, delta=13: sin(13)= approx 0.2249510543.

Term=9 * 0.2249510543≈2.024559489.

Now sum all terms:

1 + 2.76151456 =3.76151456.

Plus 4.09576022 → 7.85727478.

Plus 3.5 → 11.35727478.

Plus 2.024559489 → 13.38183427.

So sum is 13.38183427.

Multiply by 1/k=3.9466 fm.

So 13.38183427 * 3.9466.

Let me compute this more accurately.

13.38183427 *3 =40.14550281.

13.38183427 *0.9466 = ?

0.9466 = 0.9 +0.04 + 0.0066.

0.9 *13.38183427 =12.04365084.

0.04 *13.38183427=0.53527337.

0.0066 *13.38183427=0.08821102.

Adding these: 12.04365084 + 0.53527337 =12.57892421 +0.08821102=12.66713523.

So total sum is 40.14550281 +12.66713523=52.81263804 fm.

So Im f ≈52.813 fm.

But the options are A, B, C, D as before. None of them is near 52.8.

But wait, the options are A) 87163 fm, which is way too big. B) 355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm... Did I miss a factor somewhere? Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i delta_l} -1 ] Pl( cos theta ), but when theta=0, and when you take the imaginary part, maybe the factor is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) Pl(cos theta) ].

In that case, when theta=0, Pl(1)=1, so f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) (e^{i delta_l} -1 ).

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin delta_l.

Which is what I did. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me recheck.

In natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

E =50 MeV.

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → but for E=50 MeV, m c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, so (E)^2 ≈ (p c)^2 → p c ≈ E → p ≈ E / c.

But wait, p is in MeV/c units. So p = E/(c^2) * c → p = E/(c). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

Alternatively, using the relativistic relation:

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2.

But for E=50 MeV and m c^2=0.511 MeV, E >> m c², so p ≈ E/(c²) * c → p ≈ E/(c) → which in units where c=3e8 m/s, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of natural units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k using the formula k = (E)/( ħ c ) * (1/ (1 + (m c^2)/(E)) )^(1/2). But for E >> m c², the term (m c^2/E) is negligible, so k ≈ E/( ħ c ). 

So, with E=50 MeV, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm, so k = 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹.

Which gives 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

Wait, so that part seems correct.

So why is the answer not matching any of the options? Maybe I made a mistake in the phase shifts.

Wait, the problem gives the phase shifts as delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_4=13°. So that's l=0 to l=4.

Wait, but for each l, the phase shift is delta_l. So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the factor of 2 in the formula? Let me think. No, the formula is (2l +1), and I correctly summed l from 0 to 4, each with (2l+1) multiplied by sin(delta_l).

Hmm, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) times the sum, but I forgot a factor of 2? Let me check the formula.

Wait, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] P_l (cos theta )

Wait, no, wait, another source says f(theta) = (1/(2ik) ) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] P_l (cos theta )

So the 1/(2ik) factor is correct. So Im(f) would be [1/(2k)] sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ?

Wait, wait, no. Because [e^{i delta} -1] is (cos delta -1) + i sin delta.

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin delta, and the real part is (2l+1)(cos delta -1).

So when you take Im(f(theta)), it's [1/(2k)] sum (2l+1) sin delta.

Wait, so perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2?

In that case, the sum would be 13.38183427, multiplied by 1/(2k) → 1/(2 * 3.9466) → 1/7.8932 ≈0.1267 fm.

Wait, no, that would give 13.38 *0.1267 ≈1.699 fm, which is not matching the options.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The formula is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] P_l (cos theta )

So, when theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(theta=0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)( e^{i delta_l} -1 )

The imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Because [e^{i delta} -1 ] = (cos delta -1) + i sin delta.

So Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Wait, so I missed a factor of 1/2! So that changes everything.

So the correct Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum.

So in that case, with sum=13.38183427.

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *3.9466) ≈0.1267 fm.

Multiply by sum: 13.3818 * 0.1267 ≈1.699 fm? But the options are much larger.

Wait, that can't be right either.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) Pl(cos theta) ]

So the factor is (1/k), not 1/(2k). That would align with the initial calculation I did, which gave about 52.8 fm. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] Pl( cos theta )

In that case, Im(f) would be 1/(2k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

So Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

Which with sum=13.3818, 1/(2k)=1/(2*3.9466)≈0.1267 fm.

13.3818 *0.1267≈1.699 fm. Hmm, which is nowhere near the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute p in different units.

Wait, another approach: compute the wavelength lambda, which is 2pi/k.

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the momentum p in terms of MeV/c.

E =50 MeV.

In natural units, E (MeV) = pc (since E = pc for massless particles). So p = E / c → p =50 MeV/c.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) → but ħ is in units of MeV·fm / c. Wait, no, wait: ħ has units of J·s, but when using natural units where c=1, ħ c is in MeV·fm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the unit conversion. Maybe it's better to use the relativistic formula to find k.

The relativistic relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

E =50 MeV.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV, so E^2 ≈ (pc)^2 → p c = E → p = E/(c^2) * c → p = E/(c).

Wait, but I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I can compute p as E / c → so p =50 MeV/c.

But we have ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) → but ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c → because ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So substituting, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) → c cancels, → k = (50 / 197.33) fm^{-1} → ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.946 fm.

So the initial calculation for k seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the formula I used for the imaginary part is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), but when I got 52.8 fm, but the options are much larger, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility: the formula for the scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) P_l(cos theta) ]

But perhaps I should be using the expression f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)( e^{i delta_l} -1 ) P_l( cos theta )

In that case, Im(f) would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

So Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

So sum is 13.38183427.

1/(2k)=1/(2 *3.9466)≈0.1267 fm^{-1}.

So 13.38183427 *0.1267 ≈1.699 fm.

But none of the options are near this.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? No, the question states they're in degrees, so I think converting them to radians would change the sine values, but I don't think that's the issue here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again: the phase shifts are delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_4=13°. So that's 5 terms, correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the sum is (2l +1) * sin(2 delta_l ), but that would change things. Let me see.

Wait, if the formula was sin(2 delta), then for l=0, sin(180)=0, which would eliminate the first term. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sin(delta_l), which is correct.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. Looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm. Hmm, 251 is about 5 times 50, but 52.8 is near that factor.

Wait, 52.8 *4.75 is about 251.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 or 5. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. Let me compute the sum using radians.

Compute each delta in radians:

delta_0=90° → pi/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

sin(pi/2)=1.

delta_1=67° → approx 1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205.

delta_2=55° → approx 0.95993 rad. sin(0.95993)= approx 0.8192.

delta_3=30° → pi/6=0.5236 rad. sin=0.5.

delta_4=13° → approx 0.2269 rad. sin=0.22495.

So same as before. So that can't be the mistake.

Wait, another approach: maybe the phase shifts are the real parts and the imaginary parts are given, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually includes the factor (2l+1) in front, but I should have multiplied each term by (2l+1), which I did.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) Pl(cos theta) ]

And I correctly took the imaginary part as (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

So, if that's correct, then the calculation leads to approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the units for the wave number are wrong. Because 52.8 fm is way larger than the options, which are on the order of hundreds of fm. But wait, the options are in the hundreds, so 52.8 is an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest option (C is 177.675).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. For high energies, that doesn't matter, but let me see.

The total energy E is γ m c², and the kinetic energy is E_kin = (γ-1) m c². So if the problem states the electron has 50 MeV, perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

In that case, E_kin =50 MeV → E=γ m c² = m c² + E_kin ≈50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

But that's negligible, so the earlier calculation holds.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

But for l=0, that would be sin(180)=0, which would eliminate the first term. But that's not helping.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ ( e^{i delta_l} ) sin(delta_l) ]

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the term:

e^{i delta} -1 = cos delta + i sin delta -1 = (cos delta -1) + i sin delta.

So the imaginary part is sin delta.

Wait, so the formula is correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the phase shifts were given in the question as delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, etc., but in the formula, the phase shifts are such that the scattering amplitude includes e^{i delta_l}, but perhaps the given phase shifts are delta_l, and the formula uses delta_l as the argument. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

But then I'm not seeing why the options are so much larger.

Wait, perhaps the sum is not up to l=4, but higher l. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so only up to l=4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different form. Maybe the phase shifts are given as the inverse, or perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the Mandelstam variable.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the sum of the phase shifts, not each (2l+1) * sin delta_l.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin( delta_l )

Which is what I used.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck the sum:

l=0: (2*0+1)*sin(90) → 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) → 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) →5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum is 13.382.

Multiply by 1/k=3.9466: 13.382 *3.9466 ≈52.81.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 355, which is about 6.7 times 52.8. 355/52.8≈6.73.

Hmm, 6.73 is approximately 2*3.36.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using a factor of 2, but why?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 because of the 2 in 2ik in the denominator.

Wait, the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Which would make it 13.382 * (1/(2*3.9466)) → which is 13.382 * (0.1267) →≈1.699 fm.

That's way too small, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ]

Which gives Im(f)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) → which is 13.382 *3.9466≈52.8 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude f is given as:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i delta_l} -1 ]

But that's not correct according to what I know.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ]

But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are for the partial waves in a different way. Maybe the delta_l are the real and imaginary parts, but that's not the case here; the problem gives them as phase shifts.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck and not sure where the mistake is. But based on the calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ), but that would be different.

Wait, for l=0, sin(180) is zero, which would eliminate that term.

Then, l=1:3*sin(134°)=3*sin(134)=3*0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum these: 2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=0.1267 →16.7134 *0.1267≈2.117 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the sum of the phase shifts, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] → but wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ] → which would give the same as before, 52.8 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are actually the real parts, and the imaginary parts are given elsewhere. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are not given correctly. Let me check: delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, etc.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the order l=0, l=1, l=2, l=3, l=4, which is correct.

But perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Which would give:

l=0: sin(180)=0.

l=1: 3*sin(134)=3 *0.6691≈2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=0.1267 →16.7134 *0.1267 ≈2.117 fm.

No.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial formula and recheck.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} Pl(cos theta )

But when you expand e^{i delta_l}, the real part is cos(delta_l), etc.

Wait, but in that case, the formula would be f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l) ] Pl(cos theta )

Which would mean the real part is (sum (2l+1) cos(delta_l) Pl)/ (2k ), and the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) Pl )/(2k )

But that would make Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (2k )

Which is what I calculated earlier, leading to 1.7 fm.

But that's not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to scattering theory.

In scattering theory, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1) P_l(cos theta) ]

Which comes from expanding the exponential and considering the phase shifts.

So the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta )

At theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 is about 3.37 times 52.8.

Wait, 52.8 *3.37= about 177.6.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see where the factor of 3.37 comes from.

Wait, perhaps the correct Im(f) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ] → which is 52.8 fm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using the non-relativistic formula, but that would be a mistake for 50 MeV electrons.

Non-relativistic k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

m for electron is 0.511 MeV/c².

E=50 MeV.

So k= sqrt(2 *0.511 *50) / ħ → sqrt(51.1) → approx 7.15 / 197.33 → 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Which would make 1/k about 27.6 fm.

But then Im(f)=52.8 * 27.6 → which is way too big, leading to 1460 fm, which isn't an option.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Hmm.

In the end, based on the calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians. Let me compute the sum with radians.

Wait, delta_0=90°=pi/2 → sin(pi/2)=1.

delta_1=67°=1.16937 rad → sin=0.9205.

delta_2=55°=0.95993 rad → sin=0.8192.

delta_3=30=0.5236 rad → sin=0.5.

delta_4=13=0.2269 rad → sin=0.22495.

Same as before.

So sum remains 13.382.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2, making the answer about 105.6, but that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D:251.271 fm.

Which is approximately 251.27.

Hmm, 52.8 * 4.75 ≈251.2.

So 4.75 is 19/4.

But I can't see a reason for this factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum as:

sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ]

But that involves complex numbers. Wait, but when taking the imaginary part, it's the same as considering only sin(delta_l ), as done before.

I'm stuck. Given the options, and the calculation leading to approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ].

Which for theta=0, gives:

sum = (1*(e^{i90} -1) ) + (3*(e^{i67} -1)) + ... 

But the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), so the total is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), multiplied by 1/k.

Which leads to 52.8 fm.

Hmm.

I think I'm going to have to conclude that the intended answer is not present in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to select option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 3.37 times the calculated value of 52.8.

Wait, 52.8 *3.37 is about 177.7, which matches option C.

So perhaps I missed a factor of 3.37 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ), leading to a higher sum.

Wait, let's compute sum with 2 delta_l:

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:2.0073+4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/k=3.9466 →16.7134 *3.9466 ≈65.75 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 3.37 due to a calculation error.

Alternatively, perhaps I should switch to using a different formula, such as the optical theorem.

Wait, the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (theta=0) to the total cross-section.

The formula is Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

But without knowing σ_total, this might not help directly.

But perhaps I can compute σ_total using the given phase shifts.

The total cross-section is given by:

σ_total = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) ( (sin delta_l )^2 )

So, compute each (sin delta_l )^2:

l=0: sin^2(90)=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1: sin^2(67)≈(0.9205)^2≈0.8473 → term=3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2: sin^2(55)=0.8192²≈0.6710 → term=5*0.6710≈3.355.

l=3: sin^2(30)=0.25 → term=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: sin^2(13)=0.22495²≈0.0506 → term=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum these terms:

1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So σ_total = 9.1023 barns? Wait, no, the units would be in barns, but the optical theorem uses units where σ_total is in (4π/k²) units.

Wait, the optical theorem says Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

So Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) (sin delta_l )^2.

Wait, but k is in fm⁻¹.

So k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) = (0.2533 / (4π)) *9.1023.

Compute 0.2533/(4π) → 0.2533/(12.566)≈0.02016 fm.

Multiply by 9.1023 →0.02016 *9.1023≈0.1837 fm.

Which is again way smaller than the options.

Hmm, not helpful.

At this point, I think I've exhausted my options and can't find where the mistake is. Given the initial calculation leads to approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't an option, but option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 3.37 times 52.8, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see why that factor would apply. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the sum with more precise sine values.

Let me recompute each term more precisely.

l=0: 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) → sin(67 degrees)= sin(1.16937 rad)=0.9205048534 → 3 *0.9205048534=2.76151456.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 * sin(0.95993 rad)=5 *0.8191520443=4.09576022.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249510543=2.024559489.

Sum: 1 +2.76151456=3.76151456 +4.09576022=7.85727478.

+3.5=11.35727478 +2.024559489=13.38183427.

So sum is exactly 13.38183427.

Then, 1/k=3.9466.

So 13.38183427 *3.9466= let's compute this precisely.

13.38183427 *3 =40.14550281.

13.38183427 *0.9466= ?

0.9466 =0.9 +0.04 +0.0066.

0.9 *13.38183427=12.04365084.

0.04 *13.38183427=0.53527337.

0.0066 *13.38183427=0.08821102.

Adding these:

12.04365084 +0.53527337=12.57892421 +0.08821102=12.66713523.

Total sum:40.14550281 +12.66713523=52.81263804 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option C is the closest to 52.8 multiplied by 3.37, but I can't see why that factor would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ] and use that even if it's not matching the options.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is option C:177.675 fm. Hmm, but 177 is roughly 3.37 times 52.8, which might be due to a mistake in the phase shifts being considered as delta_l = 2 delta_l, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the correct formula involves a different factor.

At this point, I think I've spent enough time and will go with the initial calculation, but since the answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Which for the given phase shifts would give:

sum=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=0.1267 →16.7134 *0.1267≈2.117 fm.

No.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form of delta_l, but their actual values are the inverses, or perhaps the problem gives the phase shifts as the imaginary parts, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are the real parts, but that doesn't seem right.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 52.8 fm, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 3.37 times larger. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)
\]

### Step 1: Compute the wave number \(k\)
The energy of the electrons is \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), and the relativistic relation \(E \approx pc\) is used. In natural units where \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), the momentum \(p\) is approximately \(E/c\). Thus:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

The inverse wave number is:

\[
\frac{1}{k} \approx 3.9466 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). The sine values are calculated as follows:

- \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\)
- \(\sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205\)
- \(\sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192\)
- \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\)
- \(\sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495\)

The terms \((2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)\) are:

- \(l=0\): \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(l=1\): \(3 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 2.7615\)
- \(l=2\): \(5 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 4.096\)
- \(l=3\): \(7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5\)
- \(l=4\): \(9 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 2.02455\)

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.382
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}(f(0))\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 3.9466 \cdot 13.382 \approx 52.8 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \(52.8 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \(C\) (\(177.675 \, \text{fm}\)) is approximately \(3.37\) times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy might arise from an unaccounted factor in the problem setup or interpretation of the phase shifts.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the closest option to the computed value is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given data is the phase shifts at different angular momenta, delta_0 to delta_4, each with their respective values. Oh wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, but as given, we have up to delta_4.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(k, k', theta) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over all angular momentum states, each contributing a term with the phase shift.

Wait, right, the general form is something like f(theta) equals (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to infinity of (2l +1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) * (Pl(cos theta)), where Pl is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the imaginary part is what we're after, and along the incident direction, which is theta = 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam direction is along the initial direction, so when you scatter, theta is the angle between the initial and final directions.

Wait, no, wait. The incident beam direction is when theta is zero. Because theta is the scattering angle, measured from the direction of the incoming particle. So when the electron scatters in the same direction, theta is zero. So we need to compute f(theta=0) and find its imaginary part.

The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l (cosθ)

But wait, I think I might have that 1/(2ik) factor wrong. Wait, perhaps it's (1/k) times the sum, because each term has (2l+1) times something. Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) ∑ (2l + 1) [e^{i δ_l} - 1] P_l (cosθ). Because when you expand e^{iδ} as cosδ + i sinδ, subtracting 1 would give i sinδ + (cosδ -1), but when you're taking the imaginary part, the real parts might not contribute in some terms.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f(theta) along the incident direction, which is theta=0. So I can plug theta=0 into the expression.

Let me think again. The formula for f is:

f(θ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But each P_l(1), since cos(0)=1. What's the value of P_l(1) for different l? The Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are just 1 for all l. Because P_l(1)=1 for any l. So when θ=0, cosθ=1, so each P_l is 1.

So f(theta=0) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)[ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ]

But we can split this into real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im[e^{i δ_l} -1 ].

What's Im[e^{i δ_l} - 1 ]? Let's compute it. e^{i δ} is cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{i δ} -1 = (cosδ -1) + i sin δ. The imaginary part is sin δ. So the imaginary part of f(theta=0) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part Im f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin δ_l, since higher l phase shifts are ignored (as per the question: "Ignore rest of the phase shifts.").

Wait, but the given phase shifts are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. So l runs from 0 to 4, because delta_0 is l=0, delta_1 is l=1, etc.

So let me compute each term (2l+1) * sin(δ_l), sum them up, then multiply by 1/k.

Wait, but what is k? The wave number. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. So we need to find k, the wave number, in appropriate units.

Hmm, the relation between the kinetic energy and the wave number. For non-relativistic particles, k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But electrons with 50 MeV are relativistic, right? Because 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. So we need to use relativistic expressions.

Wait, but wait, in scattering experiments involving electrons, sometimes the relation is approximated using the relativistic formula. The energy E is given as 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so E ≈ pc, where p is the momentum. So p = E / c. But wait, for high energies, E = pc. So E = pc → p = E/(c). Then, the wave number k is p/ħ. So k = E/(ħ c).

Wait, let me think again. The relativistic relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. For E much larger than m c², E ≈ pc. So pc ≈ E → p ≈ E/(c). So the momentum p is approximately E/(c). But I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, but in particle physics, units are often in terms where ħ c is about 197 MeV fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters). So, for the electron's momentum, p = E/(c) → but in units where ħ c = 197 MeV fm, so p = E/(c) → but perhaps more accurately, p (in units of MeV/c) is E/(c^2) * c = E/(c). But I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here.

Let me try to compute k in terms of MeV.

The wave number k is given by k = p/ħ, where p is the momentum. Since E = γ m c², and for high energies, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.

But ħ in units of MeV·fm is approximately 197 MeV·fm. Because 197 MeV fm is about ħ c. So let me compute k.

p = E/(c) → but in units where c=1 (as in natural units), this is p = E. So p = 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c is about 197 MeV fm.

So k = p / ħ → but p is in units of MeV/c. So k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c / (MeV fm)) ) → let's see.

Alternatively, since ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) is approximately 1/(197 MeV·fm). So p = E/c = 50 MeV/c.

So k = p/(ħ) → [50 MeV/c ] / [ ħ ] → but ħ is in units of MeV·fm / c. Wait, perhaps a better approach: express ħ c as 197 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197 MeV·fm)/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (E/c) / ( (197 MeV fm)/c ) ) → the c's cancel, so k = E / (197 MeV fm) → E is 50 MeV. So k = 50 / 197 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so k ≈ 50 / 197 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈ 197 / 50 ≈ 3.94 fm.

Wait, but let me compute 50 / 197: 197 is about 200, so 50/200 is 0.25. So 0.253 is a better approximation.

So 1/k is approximately 3.94 fm.

But perhaps I should compute it more precisely:

50 / 197 = approximately 0.2533. So 1/k = 197/50 = 3.94.

So k ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k = 3.94 fm.

Now, let's compute the sum for each l from 0 to 4:

Each term is (2l+1) * sin(delta_l degrees).

First, convert all delta_l degrees to radians, because the sine function in calculations is usually in radians. Alternatively, just compute the sine in degrees. Let me note down each term.

l=0: delta=90°, so sin(90)=1. (2*0+1)=1 → term is 1*1=1.

l=1: delta=67°. sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205. (2*1+1)=3 → 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: delta=55°. sin(55)≈0.8192. (2*2+1)=5 → 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3: delta=30°. sin(30)=0.5. (2*3+1)=7 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: delta=13°. sin(13°) ≈0.22495. (2*4+1)=9 →9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.38205.

Then, Im f = (1/k) * sum → (1/k) is about 3.94 fm.

So Im f ≈ 3.94 * 13.38205 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

3.94 *13.38205.

3 *13.38205=40.14615.

0.94 *13.38205: 0.9 *13.38205=12.043845, 0.04 *13.38205=0.535282 → total 12.579127.

So total is 40.14615 +12.579127 ≈52.725277.

Wait, but wait, 3.94 *13.38205=?

Wait, 3.94 *13 is 51.22 → 3.94 *0.38205 ≈ 1.507. So 51.22 +1.507=52.727.

Approximately 52.727 fm.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, none of these are near 52.7 fm. Hmm, so that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for k. Let me recheck that.

Electron energy E=50 MeV.

In relativistic terms, the momentum p can be found from E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but when E >> m c², E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c^2) * c = E/(c) → p ≈ E/(c).

Wait, but the units here might be tricky. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

But p in natural units is E/c (since E = pc for high energy). So p = E/(c) = (50 MeV) / (c) → but in terms of units where ħ c is in MeV·fm, I can write it as:

k = (E / c ) / ħ = (50 MeV / c ) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ) )

The c's cancel, so denominator is (197.33 MeV·fm ), numerator is 50 MeV.

So k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k = 197.33 /50 = 3.9466 fm.

So that part seems correct.

Now, sum of (2l+1) * sin(delta_l) is:

l=0: 1*1 =1 → 1

l=1:3 * sin(67) → sin(67)= approx 0.9205 → 3*0.9205=2.7615 → total so far 3.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) → sin(55)=0.8192 → 5*0.8192=4.096 → total 7.8575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5 → total 11.3575.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*.22495≈2.02455 → total 13.38205.

So sum is about 13.382.

Multiply by 1/k (3.9466 fm):

13.382 * 3.9466 ≈ ?

Let me calculate this more accurately.

13.382 *3 =40.146

13.382 *0.9466= ?

0.9 *13.382=12.0438

0.04 *13.382=0.53528

0.0066 *13.382≈0.088

So 12.0438 +0.53528=12.57908 +0.088=12.66708.

Total is 40.146 +12.66708≈52.813.

Wait, about 52.813 fm.

But the options are way larger than that.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor. Maybe the formula I used is incorrect.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l), but perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length. So, perhaps the imaginary part is in fm, which matches the options.

Wait, wait, but the sum is about 13.38, times 3.9466 fm gives about 52.8 fm. But none of the options are 52.8. Hmm.

Looking at the options: option C is 177.675 fm, which is roughly 3.37 times the 52.8. Hmm, that's near 3.375, which is 27/8 = 3.375. Or perhaps I messed up the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute each term with more precise sine values.

Compute each (2l+1)*sin(delta_l):

l=0, delta=90: sin(90)=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1, delta=67: sin(67) = let's calculate it accurately. 67 degrees.

Using calculator, sin(67)= approx 0.9205048534.

So term=3 * 0.9205048534 ≈ 2.76151456 → 2.76151456.

l=2, delta=55: sin(55) ≈ 0.8191520443.

Term=5 * 0.8191520443≈4.09576022.

l=3, delta=30: sin(30)=0.5 → 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4, delta=13: sin(13)= approx 0.2249510543.

Term=9 * 0.2249510543≈2.024559489.

Now sum all terms:

1 + 2.76151456 =3.76151456.

Plus 4.09576022 → 7.85727478.

Plus 3.5 → 11.35727478.

Plus 2.024559489 → 13.38183427.

So sum is 13.38183427.

Multiply by 1/k=3.9466 fm.

So 13.38183427 * 3.9466.

Let me compute this more accurately.

13.38183427 *3 =40.14550281.

13.38183427 *0.9466 = ?

0.9466 = 0.9 +0.04 + 0.0066.

0.9 *13.38183427 =12.04365084.

0.04 *13.38183427=0.53527337.

0.0066 *13.38183427=0.08821102.

Adding these: 12.04365084 + 0.53527337 =12.57892421 +0.08821102=12.66713523.

So total sum is 40.14550281 +12.66713523=52.81263804 fm.

So Im f ≈52.813 fm.

But the options are A, B, C, D as before. None of them is near 52.8.

But wait, the options are A) 87163 fm, which is way too big. B) 355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm... Did I miss a factor somewhere? Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i delta_l} -1 ] Pl( cos theta ), but when theta=0, and when you take the imaginary part, maybe the factor is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) Pl(cos theta) ].

In that case, when theta=0, Pl(1)=1, so f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) (e^{i delta_l} -1 ).

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin delta_l.

Which is what I did. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me recheck.

In natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

E =50 MeV.

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → but for E=50 MeV, m c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, so (E)^2 ≈ (p c)^2 → p c ≈ E → p ≈ E / c.

But wait, p is in MeV/c units. So p = E/(c^2) * c → p = E/(c). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

Alternatively, using the relativistic relation:

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2.

But for E=50 MeV and m c^2=0.511 MeV, E >> m c², so p ≈ E/(c²) * c → p ≈ E/(c) → which in units where c=3e8 m/s, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of natural units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k using the formula k = (E)/( ħ c ) * (1/ (1 + (m c^2)/(E)) )^(1/2). But for E >> m c², the term (m c^2/E) is negligible, so k ≈ E/( ħ c ). 

So, with E=50 MeV, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm, so k = 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹.

Which gives 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

Wait, so that part seems correct.

So why is the answer not matching any of the options? Maybe I made a mistake in the phase shifts.

Wait, the problem gives the phase shifts as delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_4=13°. So that's l=0 to l=4.

Wait, but for each l, the phase shift is delta_l. So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the factor of 2 in the formula? Let me think. No, the formula is (2l +1), and I correctly summed l from 0 to 4, each with (2l+1) multiplied by sin(delta_l).

Hmm, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) times the sum, but I forgot a factor of 2? Let me check the formula.

Wait, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] P_l (cos theta )

Wait, no, wait, another source says f(theta) = (1/(2ik) ) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] P_l (cos theta )

So the 1/(2ik) factor is correct. So Im(f) would be [1/(2k)] sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ?

Wait, wait, no. Because [e^{i delta} -1] is (cos delta -1) + i sin delta.

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin delta, and the real part is (2l+1)(cos delta -1).

So when you take Im(f(theta)), it's [1/(2k)] sum (2l+1) sin delta.

Wait, so perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2?

In that case, the sum would be 13.38183427, multiplied by 1/(2k) → 1/(2 * 3.9466) → 1/7.8932 ≈0.1267 fm.

Wait, no, that would give 13.38 *0.1267 ≈1.699 fm, which is not matching the options.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The formula is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] P_l (cos theta )

So, when theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(theta=0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)( e^{i delta_l} -1 )

The imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Because [e^{i delta} -1 ] = (cos delta -1) + i sin delta.

So Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Wait, so I missed a factor of 1/2! So that changes everything.

So the correct Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum.

So in that case, with sum=13.38183427.

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *3.9466) ≈0.1267 fm.

Multiply by sum: 13.3818 * 0.1267 ≈1.699 fm? But the options are much larger.

Wait, that can't be right either.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) Pl(cos theta) ]

So the factor is (1/k), not 1/(2k). That would align with the initial calculation I did, which gave about 52.8 fm. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] Pl( cos theta )

In that case, Im(f) would be 1/(2k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

So Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

Which with sum=13.3818, 1/(2k)=1/(2*3.9466)≈0.1267 fm.

13.3818 *0.1267≈1.699 fm. Hmm, which is nowhere near the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute p in different units.

Wait, another approach: compute the wavelength lambda, which is 2pi/k.

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the momentum p in terms of MeV/c.

E =50 MeV.

In natural units, E (MeV) = pc (since E = pc for massless particles). So p = E / c → p =50 MeV/c.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) → but ħ is in units of MeV·fm / c. Wait, no, wait: ħ has units of J·s, but when using natural units where c=1, ħ c is in MeV·fm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the unit conversion. Maybe it's better to use the relativistic formula to find k.

The relativistic relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

E =50 MeV.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV, so E^2 ≈ (pc)^2 → p c = E → p = E/(c^2) * c → p = E/(c).

Wait, but I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I can compute p as E / c → so p =50 MeV/c.

But we have ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) → but ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c → because ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So substituting, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) → c cancels, → k = (50 / 197.33) fm^{-1} → ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.946 fm.

So the initial calculation for k seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the formula I used for the imaginary part is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), but when I got 52.8 fm, but the options are much larger, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility: the formula for the scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) P_l(cos theta) ]

But perhaps I should be using the expression f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)( e^{i delta_l} -1 ) P_l( cos theta )

In that case, Im(f) would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

So Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

So sum is 13.38183427.

1/(2k)=1/(2 *3.9466)≈0.1267 fm^{-1}.

So 13.38183427 *0.1267 ≈1.699 fm.

But none of the options are near this.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? No, the question states they're in degrees, so I think converting them to radians would change the sine values, but I don't think that's the issue here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again: the phase shifts are delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_4=13°. So that's 5 terms, correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the sum is (2l +1) * sin(2 delta_l ), but that would change things. Let me see.

Wait, if the formula was sin(2 delta), then for l=0, sin(180)=0, which would eliminate the first term. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sin(delta_l), which is correct.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. Looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm. Hmm, 251 is about 5 times 50, but 52.8 is near that factor.

Wait, 52.8 *4.75 is about 251.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 or 5. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. Let me compute the sum using radians.

Compute each delta in radians:

delta_0=90° → pi/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

sin(pi/2)=1.

delta_1=67° → approx 1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205.

delta_2=55° → approx 0.95993 rad. sin(0.95993)= approx 0.8192.

delta_3=30° → pi/6=0.5236 rad. sin=0.5.

delta_4=13° → approx 0.2269 rad. sin=0.22495.

So same as before. So that can't be the mistake.

Wait, another approach: maybe the phase shifts are the real parts and the imaginary parts are given, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually includes the factor (2l+1) in front, but I should have multiplied each term by (2l+1), which I did.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) Pl(cos theta) ]

And I correctly took the imaginary part as (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

So, if that's correct, then the calculation leads to approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the units for the wave number are wrong. Because 52.8 fm is way larger than the options, which are on the order of hundreds of fm. But wait, the options are in the hundreds, so 52.8 is an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest option (C is 177.675).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. For high energies, that doesn't matter, but let me see.

The total energy E is γ m c², and the kinetic energy is E_kin = (γ-1) m c². So if the problem states the electron has 50 MeV, perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

In that case, E_kin =50 MeV → E=γ m c² = m c² + E_kin ≈50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

But that's negligible, so the earlier calculation holds.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

But for l=0, that would be sin(180)=0, which would eliminate the first term. But that's not helping.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ ( e^{i delta_l} ) sin(delta_l) ]

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the term:

e^{i delta} -1 = cos delta + i sin delta -1 = (cos delta -1) + i sin delta.

So the imaginary part is sin delta.

Wait, so the formula is correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the phase shifts were given in the question as delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, etc., but in the formula, the phase shifts are such that the scattering amplitude includes e^{i delta_l}, but perhaps the given phase shifts are delta_l, and the formula uses delta_l as the argument. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

But then I'm not seeing why the options are so much larger.

Wait, perhaps the sum is not up to l=4, but higher l. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so only up to l=4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different form. Maybe the phase shifts are given as the inverse, or perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the Mandelstam variable.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the sum of the phase shifts, not each (2l+1) * sin delta_l.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin( delta_l )

Which is what I used.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck the sum:

l=0: (2*0+1)*sin(90) → 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) → 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) →5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum is 13.382.

Multiply by 1/k=3.9466: 13.382 *3.9466 ≈52.81.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 355, which is about 6.7 times 52.8. 355/52.8≈6.73.

Hmm, 6.73 is approximately 2*3.36.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using a factor of 2, but why?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 because of the 2 in 2ik in the denominator.

Wait, the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Which would make it 13.382 * (1/(2*3.9466)) → which is 13.382 * (0.1267) →≈1.699 fm.

That's way too small, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ]

Which gives Im(f)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) → which is 13.382 *3.9466≈52.8 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude f is given as:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i delta_l} -1 ]

But that's not correct according to what I know.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ]

But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are for the partial waves in a different way. Maybe the delta_l are the real and imaginary parts, but that's not the case here; the problem gives them as phase shifts.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck and not sure where the mistake is. But based on the calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ), but that would be different.

Wait, for l=0, sin(180) is zero, which would eliminate that term.

Then, l=1:3*sin(134°)=3*sin(134)=3*0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum these: 2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=0.1267 →16.7134 *0.1267≈2.117 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the sum of the phase shifts, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] → but wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ] → which would give the same as before, 52.8 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are actually the real parts, and the imaginary parts are given elsewhere. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are not given correctly. Let me check: delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, etc.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the order l=0, l=1, l=2, l=3, l=4, which is correct.

But perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Which would give:

l=0: sin(180)=0.

l=1: 3*sin(134)=3 *0.6691≈2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=0.1267 →16.7134 *0.1267 ≈2.117 fm.

No.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial formula and recheck.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} Pl(cos theta )

But when you expand e^{i delta_l}, the real part is cos(delta_l), etc.

Wait, but in that case, the formula would be f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l) ] Pl(cos theta )

Which would mean the real part is (sum (2l+1) cos(delta_l) Pl)/ (2k ), and the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) Pl )/(2k )

But that would make Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (2k )

Which is what I calculated earlier, leading to 1.7 fm.

But that's not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to scattering theory.

In scattering theory, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1) P_l(cos theta) ]

Which comes from expanding the exponential and considering the phase shifts.

So the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta )

At theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 is about 3.37 times 52.8.

Wait, 52.8 *3.37= about 177.6.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see where the factor of 3.37 comes from.

Wait, perhaps the correct Im(f) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ] → which is 52.8 fm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using the non-relativistic formula, but that would be a mistake for 50 MeV electrons.

Non-relativistic k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

m for electron is 0.511 MeV/c².

E=50 MeV.

So k= sqrt(2 *0.511 *50) / ħ → sqrt(51.1) → approx 7.15 / 197.33 → 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Which would make 1/k about 27.6 fm.

But then Im(f)=52.8 * 27.6 → which is way too big, leading to 1460 fm, which isn't an option.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Hmm.

In the end, based on the calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians. Let me compute the sum with radians.

Wait, delta_0=90°=pi/2 → sin(pi/2)=1.

delta_1=67°=1.16937 rad → sin=0.9205.

delta_2=55°=0.95993 rad → sin=0.8192.

delta_3=30=0.5236 rad → sin=0.5.

delta_4=13=0.2269 rad → sin=0.22495.

Same as before.

So sum remains 13.382.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2, making the answer about 105.6, but that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D:251.271 fm.

Which is approximately 251.27.

Hmm, 52.8 * 4.75 ≈251.2.

So 4.75 is 19/4.

But I can't see a reason for this factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum as:

sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ]

But that involves complex numbers. Wait, but when taking the imaginary part, it's the same as considering only sin(delta_l ), as done before.

I'm stuck. Given the options, and the calculation leading to approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ].

Which for theta=0, gives:

sum = (1*(e^{i90} -1) ) + (3*(e^{i67} -1)) + ... 

But the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), so the total is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), multiplied by 1/k.

Which leads to 52.8 fm.

Hmm.

I think I'm going to have to conclude that the intended answer is not present in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to select option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 3.37 times the calculated value of 52.8.

Wait, 52.8 *3.37 is about 177.7, which matches option C.

So perhaps I missed a factor of 3.37 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ), leading to a higher sum.

Wait, let's compute sum with 2 delta_l:

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:2.0073+4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/k=3.9466 →16.7134 *3.9466 ≈65.75 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 3.37 due to a calculation error.

Alternatively, perhaps I should switch to using a different formula, such as the optical theorem.

Wait, the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (theta=0) to the total cross-section.

The formula is Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

But without knowing σ_total, this might not help directly.

But perhaps I can compute σ_total using the given phase shifts.

The total cross-section is given by:

σ_total = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) ( (sin delta_l )^2 )

So, compute each (sin delta_l )^2:

l=0: sin^2(90)=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1: sin^2(67)≈(0.9205)^2≈0.8473 → term=3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2: sin^2(55)=0.8192²≈0.6710 → term=5*0.6710≈3.355.

l=3: sin^2(30)=0.25 → term=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: sin^2(13)=0.22495²≈0.0506 → term=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum these terms:

1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So σ_total = 9.1023 barns? Wait, no, the units would be in barns, but the optical theorem uses units where σ_total is in (4π/k²) units.

Wait, the optical theorem says Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

So Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) (sin delta_l )^2.

Wait, but k is in fm⁻¹.

So k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) = (0.2533 / (4π)) *9.1023.

Compute 0.2533/(4π) → 0.2533/(12.566)≈0.02016 fm.

Multiply by 9.1023 →0.02016 *9.1023≈0.1837 fm.

Which is again way smaller than the options.

Hmm, not helpful.

At this point, I think I've exhausted my options and can't find where the mistake is. Given the initial calculation leads to approximately 52.8 fm, which isn't an option, but option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 3.37 times 52.8, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see why that factor would apply. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the sum with more precise sine values.

Let me recompute each term more precisely.

l=0: 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) → sin(67 degrees)= sin(1.16937 rad)=0.9205048534 → 3 *0.9205048534=2.76151456.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 * sin(0.95993 rad)=5 *0.8191520443=4.09576022.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249510543=2.024559489.

Sum: 1 +2.76151456=3.76151456 +4.09576022=7.85727478.

+3.5=11.35727478 +2.024559489=13.38183427.

So sum is exactly 13.38183427.

Then, 1/k=3.9466.

So 13.38183427 *3.9466= let's compute this precisely.

13.38183427 *3 =40.14550281.

13.38183427 *0.9466= ?

0.9466 =0.9 +0.04 +0.0066.

0.9 *13.38183427=12.04365084.

0.04 *13.38183427=0.53527337.

0.0066 *13.38183427=0.08821102.

Adding these:

12.04365084 +0.53527337=12.57892421 +0.08821102=12.66713523.

Total sum:40.14550281 +12.66713523=52.81263804 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option C is the closest to 52.8 multiplied by 3.37, but I can't see why that factor would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i delta_l} -1 ) ] and use that even if it's not matching the options.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is option C:177.675 fm. Hmm, but 177 is roughly 3.37 times 52.8, which might be due to a mistake in the phase shifts being considered as delta_l = 2 delta_l, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the correct formula involves a different factor.

At this point, I think I've spent enough time and will go with the initial calculation, but since the answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Which for the given phase shifts would give:

sum=16.7134.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=0.1267 →16.7134 *0.1267≈2.117 fm.

No.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form of delta_l, but their actual values are the inverses, or perhaps the problem gives the phase shifts as the imaginary parts, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are the real parts, but that doesn't seem right.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 52.8 fm, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 3.37 times larger. But I'm not confident.


To solve the problem, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)
\]

### Step 1: Compute the wave number \(k\)
The energy of the electrons is \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), and the relativistic relation \(E \approx pc\) is used. In natural units where \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), the momentum \(p\) is approximately \(E/c\). Thus:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

The inverse wave number is:

\[
\frac{1}{k} \approx 3.9466 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). The sine values are calculated as follows:

- \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\)
- \(\sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205\)
- \(\sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192\)
- \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\)
- \(\sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495\)

The terms \((2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)\) are:

- \(l=0\): \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(l=1\): \(3 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 2.7615\)
- \(l=2\): \(5 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 4.096\)
- \(l=3\): \(7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5\)
- \(l=4\): \(9 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 2.02455\)

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.382
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}(f(0))\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 3.9466 \cdot 13.382 \approx 52.8 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \(52.8 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \(C\) (\(177.675 \, \text{fm}\)) is approximately \(3.37\) times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy might arise from an unaccounted factor in the problem setup or interpretation of the phase shifts.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the closest option to the computed value is:

**Answer: C**
