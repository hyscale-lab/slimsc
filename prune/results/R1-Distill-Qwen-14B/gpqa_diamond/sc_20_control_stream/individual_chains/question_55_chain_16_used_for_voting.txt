Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it's referring to. Let's see what I remember about NMR and how to interpret these signals.

The options are all some sort of propenyl or butenyl acetates. So they're esters, probably with a propenyl or butenyl group attached. The substituents are either cis or trans, which would affect the structure and the NMR spectrum.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 (1H, dq)
- 2.1 (3H, s)
- 1.6 (3H, d)

Let me break this down.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet with 3H. That's probably the acetate group's methyl (OAc). Because the methyl in acetate is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet because it's next to oxygen and not split by any neighboring protons.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. That's likely a CH3 group adjacent to a CH. Because in a doublet, it has one neighbor. So if it's a CH3 attached to a CH, maybe part of an allylic group or perhaps a propenyl group.

Now the 5.5 ppm. It's a doublet of quadruplets (dq), so it has two different coupling partners. Hmm, for a propenyl group, the middle proton is typically around 5.5-6 ppm, and it would couple with the adjacent protons on either side. Alternatively, in a butenyl group, perhaps the vinylic protons are split into more complex patterns.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling. In allylic systems, when protons are trans across a double bond, the coupling (J) is around 15-18 Hz. So this is probably an axial or trans proton on a double bond.

Wait, so maybe there's a double bond in the molecule. Let me think about the structure.

If it's an acetate, the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group. Let's think about propenyl acetate first.

Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or if it's trans or cis, like if the substituents on the double bond are in a certain configuration.

Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2, but if it's substituted differently, like maybe the acetate is attached to the middle carbon. Wait, no, acetate is an ester, so it's O connected to CH3CO and the other side is the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2CH2-OAc, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so if the ester is OCH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, perhaps?

But looking at the possible options: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Alternatively, butenyl would be four carbons, so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or similar.

Wait, but the NMR has 1H for each of the doublet and the others. Let's try to sketch possible structures.

If the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate), but I'm not sure. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, no, that would be propenoxy acetate. Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the integration. Each peak is 1H, except the singlet and the doublet of 3H each. So in the molecule, there's one proton that's a doublet (at 7.0 ppm), another that's a dq (5.5), and two CH3 groups.

So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2 with substituents. Wait, perhaps it's an allyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Let's imagine that. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc but with a double bond between the first two CH2s). Wait, no, that's propenyl. Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Looking at the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. That would be a proton that's coupled with another, trans proton. So maybe on a double bond, the protons are trans, so their coupling is large.

Wait, another way: Let's model the structure. Suppose we have a double bond with two different substituents. For example, in the case of butenyl, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how many nonequivalent protons are in the structure.

Let me think about each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond in the propenyl group.

Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the OAc is on the end, with the double bond between C1 and C2.

In this case, the vinylic protons (the ones on C1 and C2) would couple with each other. But wait, in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2: the C1 is CH2, the C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2OAc.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me correct that.

Actually, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So when it's an ester, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, perhaps if the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no, that would be a different ester.

Wait, maybe I should think of propenyl acetate as CH2=CHCH2OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, maybe that's correct. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons, so that would be butenyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between propenyl and butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so when it's an ester, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's four carbons, so maybe it's actually butenyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but where's the double bond?

Wait, perhaps the options are different. Let's look at the options again.

Options are Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, or Trans-butenyl.

So propenyl would have three carbons attached to the ester. Butenyl has four.

Wait, so for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the propenyl group.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if the OAc is on carbon 1, then the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons, which would be butenyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the actual structures.

Wait, perhaps propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, but that's four carbons, so that's butenyl, not propenyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's four carbons, which would be butenyl.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the NMR analysis.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, d, J=16 Hz) suggests a proton that is coupled to one other proton, and the large J indicates trans coupling (like on a double bond, trans configuration).

Then, the 5.5 ppm proton is a doublet of quadruplets. That probably comes from a vinylic proton where it's coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, maybe the structure has a double bond, and the NMR is showing the protons on each end.

Wait, let's consider a trans configuration. For example, in trans-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides.

Wait, propenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons. So perhaps I'm getting confused between propenyl and butenyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, but that's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the splitting patterns.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet. So this proton has one neighbor. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, so it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a double bond with substituents that lead to these splitting patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, with one proton (at 7.0 ppm) coupled to another proton on the same carbon, but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's coupled to a proton on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted double bond. Let's imagine the structure as CH2=CH-O-Ac. So the ester is attached to the CH2, and the double bond is between CH2 and CH.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 would be two H's, but each would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet for 3H, so perhaps that's the methyl from the acetate.

Let me think about the coupling. If the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 and the CH. The CH2 protons would be a doublet (coupled with the CH proton), and the CH proton would be a triplet (coupled with the two H's on CH2 and maybe another group).

But in the NMR, we have a peak at 5.5 (dq) and another at 7.0 (d). Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the 1H NMR signals.

At 7.0 ppm, a doublet (J=16 Hz): that's a vinylic proton, probably trans coupled. So the two protons on the double bond are trans, so they couple with each other, giving each a doublet.

But wait, if the coupling is trans, then each of these protons would be a doublet, each coupled to the other. So in that case, each would appear as a doublet with J ~16 Hz.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two different peaks at 7.0 and 5.5, which suggests that the two protons on the double bond have different environments, perhaps due to substituents.

Wait, perhaps one of the protons is adjacent to a CH3 group, leading to a different chemical shift. So for example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 is attached to the ester, and the CH is next to the double bond.

Wait, in that case, the CH2 would have two protons, each coupled to the CH. And the CH would be coupled to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests coupling with two different protons. That might be the case if the CH is next to both a CH2 and another group, perhaps an adjacent CH.

Alternatively, another possibility: the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the OAc is on the CH2. Wait, but that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's four carbons, so perhaps it's butenyl.

Wait, but the options include propenyl and butenyl. So maybe the correct structure is a four-carbon chain.

Wait, let's think about butenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond somewhere.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But that would give certain NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C4.

In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. The C1 would have two protons (CH2), and C2 would have one proton (CH).

Wait, but in the NMR, we have one proton at 7.0 and another at 5.5. So perhaps one of the vinylic protons is split into a doublet, and the other into a more complex multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a substituent that causes one of the vinylic protons to be more deshielded, hence appearing at a higher ppm.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That seems like a trans coupling. So perhaps the two protons are trans across the double bond.

So, in a trans-doubly substituted structure, each of the two protons would be a doublet, each seeing only one coupling partner (the other proton on the opposite side). So the 7.0 and 5.5 could be these two protons.

Wait, but why are their shifts different? Because one is more deshielded than the other, perhaps due to the substituents around.

So, for instance, if one of the vinylic protons is next to a CH3 group, it would be more deshielded. Or perhaps the substituents are on different sides.

Wait, going back to the NMR data:

7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz.

5.5 ppm: 1H, dq.

So the 7.0 is more deshielded than the 5.5, which suggests that the proton at 7.0 is in a different environment.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 and the CH.

Wait, but wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, in that case, the CH2 would be attached to the OAc, and the CH would be part of the double bond.

So the double bond would be between C2 and C3.

In that structure, the CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the CH (C2) proton.

The CH (C2) would be coupled to the CH2 and maybe to another group, like the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 5.5 ppm as a dq, which could be the CH proton. The CH2 would have two protons, which would be a triplet, but in the data, I don't see a triplet for 2H. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split into a quartet, but that's not in the data.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for the downfield signals. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which is quite downfield for a proton, so it might be a trans coupling in a conjugated system.

Looking at the options, if it's a trans configuration, then the substituents opposite each other would cause a larger J value.

Also, the presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H suggests that the CH3 is not next to any protons, so it's either an OAc group or a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm doublet for 3H: that's a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a CH3-CH where the CH is part of a double bond.

So, putting this together, perhaps the structure has a CH3-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm (d) for 3H suggests that the CH3 is adjacent to a CH group, which is part of a double bond.

So the structure could be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but with a substituent.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let's consider the possible structures:

Cis-propenyl acetate: Structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the double bond being cis.

Trans-propenyl acetate: Same structure but trans configuration.

Cis-butenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (but that's longer), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another way: the presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl, so that's clear.

The 1.6 ppm (d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So if the CH is part of a double bond, that would make the structure something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the OAc is on the CH2 group. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the CH2-OAc would have two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH=CH2.

But the NMR shows only one peak at 5.5, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the coupling in the structure.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the adjacent CH. The CH would be split by the CH2 and perhaps the CH2-OAc.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The CH2-OAc is C1, and the double bond is C2=C3.

So the CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the CH (C2) proton. The CH (C2) would be coupled to the CH2 (C1) and perhaps the CH2 (C3).

Wait, but in that case, the CH (C2) would be adjacent to CH2 (C3), which is CH2 connected to nothing else. So the CH (C2) would have coupling with the two protons on C1 and the two on C3, perhaps leading to a quartet. But the NMR shows a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons on the CH2 (C3) are split into a triplet by the adjacent CH (C2).

In this structure, the protons on C1 (CH2) would be a triplet (coupled to the CH on C2), and the CH on C2 would be a quartet (coupled to the two protons on C1 and the two on C3). But the NMR data doesn't show a triplet for 2H. Instead, the 5.5 peak is a dq, which might fit.

Wait, but the NMR shows only two peaks for the vinylic protons: 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq). So perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic protons is coupled to another proton, and the other is coupled to two different sets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a butenyl with a substituent, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis). The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on either side are cis, so the two CH2 groups are on the same side.

The vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. The C2 would have two protons, and the C3 would have one. Wait, no: CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So C2 is CH2 and C3 is CH.

Wait, no: CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 (middle of the chain).

In that case:

- The CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the adjacent CH (C2), leading to a triplet.

- The CH (C2) would have one proton, coupled to the CH2 (C1) and the CH2 (C3). But since C3 is CH2, each of its protons would couple to the C2 proton.

Wait, perhaps the C2 proton is split into a quartet (coupled to C1 and C3).

But in the NMR, the 5.5 peak is a dq, which could be due to coupling with two different sets of protons. So maybe the C2 proton is coupled to both the C1 and C3 protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3 (CH2) protons are a triplet, each coupled to the C2 proton.

But the NMR data shows a single peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a dq. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the splitting and the coupling constants.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, indicating trans coupling across a double bond.

So, the two vinylic protons are trans, which would make the structure trans. So the correct option would be either Trans-propenyl acetate or Trans-butenyl acetate.

Now, looking at the other signals:

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, if it's a CH that's coupled to a CH2 and another CH.

Wait, in the structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituents are trans, the C2 proton would be coupled to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH2), leading to a quartet perhaps, but in the NMR, it's a dq.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps that's the CH3 group on the CH2 next to the double bond.

Wait, if the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 with a trans configuration, then the CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the C2 (CH) proton. The C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3. But in the NMR, we have a 5.5 ppm as a dq, which might fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the C2 and C3 being trans.

Wait, but in that case, the C2 would be CH, and C3 would be CH2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to assign the peaks.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) is one of the vinylic protons. Let's say that's the C3 proton, which is coupled to the C2 proton (trans), leading to a doublet.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) would be the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C1 CH2 (two protons) and perhaps the C3 CH2 (two protons), leading to a quartet. But in this case, it's a dq, so perhaps it's coupled to two different types of protons, like one coupling with J1 and another with J2.

Wait, but how does that fit with the structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, but that's longer than I'm considering.

Wait, another thought: in the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would have the OAc group on one end, and the double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on opposite sides.

So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but in the trans configuration.

In that case, the C2 would be a CH with substituents on opposite sides, leading to coupling with the C1 and C3.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is Trans-propenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the substituents on the CH=CH2 being trans.

In that case, the C2 (CH) and C3 (CH2) would have their protons trans coupled.

So, the C3 CH2 would have two protons (each coupled to the C2 CH), leading to a triplet. The C2 CH would be coupled to both C1 and C3, perhaps leading to a quartet.

But the NMR shows a 7.0 ppm (d) and a 5.5 ppm (dq). So perhaps the C3's protons are split into a triplet (but the NMR doesn't show a triplet), and the C2 proton is a quartet (but the NMR shows a dq).

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to imagine the coupling in the trans-propenyl structure.

In trans-propenyl acetate (OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, trans configuration), the C2 and C3 are trans.

So, the C2 proton would be trans to the C3's CH2 group.

The C2 proton would be coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons) and the C3's CH2 (two protons), leading to a quartet. But in the NMR, it's a dq, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the C2 proton is only coupled to the C3's CH2, leading to a triplet. But that doesn't match the NMR data either.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. The presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) is definitely the OAc methyl group.

The 1.6 ppm (d) for 3H suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond.

So, if the structure has a CH3-CH=CH-OAc group, then the CH3 would be attached to the CH, which is part of the double bond.

Wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that's not one of the options. The options are propenyl or butenyl acetates, without substituents like CH(CH3).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH3 is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the CH2-OAc is the end. So the CH2 has a CH3 attached elsewhere.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the integration.

The NMR has:

- 7.0 (1H)
- 5.5 (1H)
- 2.1 (3H)
- 1.6 (3H)

So total of 6H (I think), but the options are propenyl and butenyl, which would have 3 or 4 carbons respectively.

Wait, propenyl has three carbons, butenyl has four.

In the NMR, the 1.6 (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that's four carbons, so butenyl.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are either propenyl or butenyl, but without substituents.

So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. No, that's not matching either.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think about the coupling patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (J=16 Hz). That's a large coupling, so trans coupling across a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's a CH that's coupled to two different CH2 groups.

The 1.6 ppm (d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, but again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH3 is on the same carbon as the OAc.

Wait, but the OAc is a methyl group attached to oxygen, so that's a separate CH3.

So, going back. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm is attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, and the CH2 is connected to a CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. That's four carbons.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps it's better to think that the correct structure is a butenyl group with a CH3 attached to the CH adjacent to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the CH2 is connected to the OAc, and adjacent to the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 would have two protons, which are split by the adjacent CH (from the double bond). The CH would have one proton, which is split by the CH2 and perhaps another group.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 peak is a doublet, and the 5.5 is a dq.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 is the proton on the CH, and the 5.5 is the CH2. But the CH2 would be a triplet, which isn't in the data.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the large J (16 Hz) indicates trans coupling, which would be in the trans isomer.

So, between the options, the trans isomers are B (Trans-propenyl) and D (Trans-butenyl).

Now, looking at the remaining data: the 5.5 ppm is a dq. In a trans-propenyl structure, the CH would be coupled to the CH2, leading to a triplet or quartet. But the NMR shows a dq, which might fit a butenyl structure where the CH is coupled to two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is a proton that's coupled to two different protons, such as in a butenyl group where the CH is next to two different CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's a four-carbon chain (butenyl). In that case, the CH2 next to the double bond (C3) would have two protons, each coupled to the adjacent CH2 (C4), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq. Alternatively, the C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH2), leading to a quartet. But the NMR shows a dq.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, with the CH2-OAc having a CH3 attached elsewhere. But that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is trans-butenyl acetate, which would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond and trans configuration.

In that case, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure for trans-butenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is propenyl, but that's three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Cis-propenyl acetate, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the proton on the CH, and the 5.5 is the CH2, but I'm not matching this correctly.

Another approach: the presence of a doublet at 7.0 with J=16 Hz suggests that this proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is trans. So it's a vinylic proton with one coupling partner on the same double bond.

In propenyl acetate, the vinylic protons are two (on CH2 and CH). If the structure is trans, the protons on CH and CH2 would be trans, leading to each being a doublet.

So, in the NMR, we would see two doublets, each at around 5-6 ppm, but the data shows one at 7.0 and another at 5.5. That might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group with substituents. The NMR might show a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about the 5.5 ppm (dq). It's a doublet of quadruplets, which means it's split into two groups, each of which is further split into a quartet. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is a quartet, but it's written as a dq. So, maybe it's a quartet from coupling with two protons, each with different J values.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 is a proton that's coupled to two different protons with different J values, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

In the trans configuration, the coupling between the vinylic protons would be larger, so the 7.0 ppm is the trans-coupled proton, and the 5.5 is another proton that's coupled to two others.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: Structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis), but I'm not sure.

B) Trans-propenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans).

C) Cis-propenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis).

D) Trans-butenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the NMR shows a CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d), which would fit a structure where the CH3 is attached to a CH that's part of the double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl).

In that case, the CH3 would be on the end of the double bond. The CH adjacent to the double bond would have a CH3 attached, leading to the 1.6 ppm (d) for the CH3.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) would be the CH2=CH-CH(CH3) group. Wait, perhaps the CH on the double bond is attached to a CH3, leading to the 1.6 ppm signal.

So, in this case, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which is a butenyl group.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and C3 is attached to a CH3.

So, the protons on the double bond would be:

- C2: CH2, with two protons.

- C3: CH, attached to CH3.

But wait, the double bond would be CH2=CH-CH3, but that's a propene structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, making it a butenyl group with a CH3 on the end.

In this case, the C3 would be CH2, and the C4 would be CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me imagine the structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and C4 is CH3.

So, the protons on the double bond are:

- C2: CH2.

- C3: CH.

The C3 CH would have a proton that's coupled to the C2 CH2 and possibly the C4 CH3.

Wait, but the C4 is CH3, so the C3 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C2 (CH2) and perhaps any adjacent protons. But the NMR shows a 5.5 as a dq, which could be due to coupling with two different sets.

The C2 CH2 would have two protons, each coupled to the C3 CH.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet, which suggests a single coupling partner.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3 CH is coupled to both the C2 CH2 and the C4 CH3.

Wait, but the C4 is CH3, which is a single proton, so perhaps not.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the available data.

The presence of a large J (16 Hz) indicates a trans configuration, so the options are B or D.

Now, looking at the other signals:

The 5.5 ppm dq could be the CH in the middle of the double bond, coupled to two different protons (like two different CH2 groups).

The 1.6 ppm (d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond. So in a butenyl group, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, with the CH3 on the end.

In that case, the C3 would be CH, attached to CH3. So the C3 proton would be coupled to the C2 CH2 and possibly the C4 CH3.

Wait, but the CH3 is on C4, so perhaps the coupling would be J between C3 and C4?

But that's a single proton, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the 1.6 ppm (d) could be the CH3 attached to the C3 CH, making the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's not a double bond.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no. The large J suggests trans, so it's either B or D.

Another approach: the number of peaks in the NMR.

The NMR has four signals, which may correspond to:

- OAc methyl (s).

- CH3 attached to CH (d).

- Two vinylic protons (d and dq).

If the structure is propenyl, there would be only two vinylic protons, but in the NMR, we have two peaks for vinylic protons, which would fit.

But the CH3 at 1.6 could fit a propenyl structure if the CH3 is on the same carbon as the CH.

Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the CH2 would be connected to OAc, and the CH would be in the middle.

In that structure, the CH has one proton, and the adjacent CH2 has two protons.

So, the CH (C2) would be coupled to the CH2 (C1), leading to a triplet or quartet.

But the NMR shows the CH as a dq. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, which would have the CH and CH2 protons trans.

In that case, the CH would be a doublet (coupled to CH2), and the CH2 would be a triplet.

But the NMR shows a 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq), which doesn't match.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for the answer that fits the data, even if I'm not entirely sure.

The correct answer is either B or D.

The 1.6 ppm (d) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond. So, in a propenyl group, the CH would have one proton, and the CH2 would have two. But the NMR shows a dq for the CH, which may not fit.

In a butenyl group, the structure could have a CH attached to a CH2 and a CH3, leading to the CH3 as a doublet.

Hmm. I'm still not confident, but I think the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no. The J=16 suggests trans, so it's not cis. So the correct option is either B or D.

Given that, and the presence of a CH3 as a doublet, perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate.

So the answer would be option D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given 1H NMR data is analyzed to identify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The key observations and deductions are as follows:

1. **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This is the methyl group of the acetate group (OAc), which is typically a singlet due to the lack of neighboring protons.

2. **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This indicates a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to a double bond. This is consistent with a CH₃-CH=CH- structure.

3. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This signal corresponds to a vinylic proton (on a CH group) that is coupled to two different sets of protons, likely due to its position in the allylic system.

4. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This is a vinylic proton coupled to another proton across a double bond. The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) suggests a trans configuration of the double bond.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Cis-propenyl acetate**: In this structure, the double bond would have cis coupling, resulting in smaller coupling constants (J < 10 Hz). The observed J = 16 Hz rules out the cis configuration.

- **Trans-propenyl acetate**: This structure has a double bond with trans coupling, which matches the large J = 16 Hz. However, the splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) does not align well with the expected signals for trans-propenyl acetate.

- **Cis-butenyl acetate**: Similar to cis-propenyl acetate, the cis configuration would result in smaller coupling constants, inconsistent with the observed J = 16 Hz.

- **Trans-butenyl acetate**: This structure has a trans double bond, consistent with the large J = 16 Hz. The splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) can be explained by the vinylic proton coupling to two different sets of protons, as expected in a butenyl system. Additionally, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the CH group in the butenyl chain.

### Conclusion:
The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the splitting patterns in the NMR data strongly support the trans configuration. Furthermore, the presence of a CH₃ group attached to a CH group in the butenyl chain aligns with the structure of Trans-butenyl acetate.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it's referring to. Let's see what I remember about NMR and how to interpret these signals.

The options are all some sort of propenyl or butenyl acetates. So they're esters, probably with a propenyl or butenyl group attached. The substituents are either cis or trans, which would affect the structure and the NMR spectrum.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 (1H, dq)
- 2.1 (3H, s)
- 1.6 (3H, d)

Let me break this down.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet with 3H. That's probably the acetate group's methyl (OAc). Because the methyl in acetate is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet because it's next to oxygen and not split by any neighboring protons.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. That's likely a CH3 group adjacent to a CH. Because in a doublet, it has one neighbor. So if it's a CH3 attached to a CH, maybe part of an allylic group or perhaps a propenyl group.

Now the 5.5 ppm. It's a doublet of quadruplets (dq), so it has two different coupling partners. Hmm, for a propenyl group, the middle proton is typically around 5.5-6 ppm, and it would couple with the adjacent protons on either side. Alternatively, in a butenyl group, perhaps the vinylic protons are split into more complex patterns.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling. In allylic systems, when protons are trans across a double bond, the coupling (J) is around 15-18 Hz. So this is probably an axial or trans proton on a double bond.

Wait, so maybe there's a double bond in the molecule. Let me think about the structure.

If it's an acetate, the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group. Let's think about propenyl acetate first.

Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or if it's trans or cis, like if the substituents on the double bond are in a certain configuration.

Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2, but if it's substituted differently, like maybe the acetate is attached to the middle carbon. Wait, no, acetate is an ester, so it's O connected to CH3CO and the other side is the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2CH2-OAc, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so if the ester is OCH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, perhaps?

But looking at the possible options: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Alternatively, butenyl would be four carbons, so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or similar.

Wait, but the NMR has 1H for each of the doublet and the others. Let's try to sketch possible structures.

If the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate), but I'm not sure. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, no, that would be propenoxy acetate. Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the integration. Each peak is 1H, except the singlet and the doublet of 3H each. So in the molecule, there's one proton that's a doublet (at 7.0 ppm), another that's a dq (5.5), and two CH3 groups.

So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2 with substituents. Wait, perhaps it's an allyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Let's imagine that. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc but with a double bond between the first two CH2s). Wait, no, that's propenyl. Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Looking at the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. That would be a proton that's coupled with another, trans proton. So maybe on a double bond, the protons are trans, so their coupling is large.

Wait, another way: Let's model the structure. Suppose we have a double bond with two different substituents. For example, in the case of butenyl, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how many nonequivalent protons are in the structure.

Let me think about each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond in the propenyl group.

Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the OAc is on the end, with the double bond between C1 and C2.

In this case, the vinylic protons (the ones on C1 and C2) would couple with each other. But wait, in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2: the C1 is CH2, the C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2OAc.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me correct that.

Actually, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So when it's an ester, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, perhaps if the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no, that would be a different ester.

Wait, maybe I should think of propenyl acetate as CH2=CHCH2OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, maybe that's correct. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons, so that would be butenyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between propenyl and butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so when it's an ester, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's four carbons, so maybe it's actually butenyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but where's the double bond?

Wait, perhaps the options are different. Let's look at the options again.

Options are Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, or Trans-butenyl.

So propenyl would have three carbons attached to the ester. Butenyl has four.

Wait, so for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the propenyl group.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if the OAc is on carbon 1, then the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons, which would be butenyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the actual structures.

Wait, perhaps propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, but that's four carbons, so that's butenyl, not propenyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's four carbons, which would be butenyl.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the NMR analysis.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, d, J=16 Hz) suggests a proton that is coupled to one other proton, and the large J indicates trans coupling (like on a double bond, trans configuration).

Then, the 5.5 ppm proton is a doublet of quadruplets. That probably comes from a vinylic proton where it's coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, maybe the structure has a double bond, and the NMR is showing the protons on each end.

Wait, let's consider a trans configuration. For example, in trans-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides.

Wait, propenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons. So perhaps I'm getting confused between propenyl and butenyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, but that's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the splitting patterns.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet. So this proton has one neighbor. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, so it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a double bond with substituents that lead to these splitting patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, with one proton (at 7.0 ppm) coupled to another proton on the same carbon, but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's coupled to a proton on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted double bond. Let's imagine the structure as CH2=CH-O-Ac. So the ester is attached to the CH2, and the double bond is between CH2 and CH.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 would be two H's, but each would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet for 3H, so perhaps that's the methyl from the acetate.

Let me think about the coupling. If the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 and the CH. The CH2 protons would be a doublet (coupled with the CH proton), and the CH proton would be a triplet (coupled with the two H's on CH2 and maybe another group).

But in the NMR, we have a peak at 5.5 (dq) and another at 7.0 (d). Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the 1H NMR signals.

At 7.0 ppm, a doublet (J=16 Hz): that's a vinylic proton, probably trans coupled. So the two protons on the double bond are trans, so they couple with each other, giving each a doublet.

But wait, if the coupling is trans, then each of these protons would be a doublet, each coupled to the other. So in that case, each would appear as a doublet with J ~16 Hz.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two different peaks at 7.0 and 5.5, which suggests that the two protons on the double bond have different environments, perhaps due to substituents.

Wait, perhaps one of the protons is adjacent to a CH3 group, leading to a different chemical shift. So for example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 is attached to the ester, and the CH is next to the double bond.

Wait, in that case, the CH2 would have two protons, each coupled to the CH. And the CH would be coupled to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests coupling with two different protons. That might be the case if the CH is next to both a CH2 and another group, perhaps an adjacent CH.

Alternatively, another possibility: the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the OAc is on the CH2. Wait, but that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's four carbons, so perhaps it's butenyl.

Wait, but the options include propenyl and butenyl. So maybe the correct structure is a four-carbon chain.

Wait, let's think about butenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond somewhere.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But that would give certain NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C4.

In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. The C1 would have two protons (CH2), and C2 would have one proton (CH).

Wait, but in the NMR, we have one proton at 7.0 and another at 5.5. So perhaps one of the vinylic protons is split into a doublet, and the other into a more complex multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a substituent that causes one of the vinylic protons to be more deshielded, hence appearing at a higher ppm.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That seems like a trans coupling. So perhaps the two protons are trans across the double bond.

So, in a trans-doubly substituted structure, each of the two protons would be a doublet, each seeing only one coupling partner (the other proton on the opposite side). So the 7.0 and 5.5 could be these two protons.

Wait, but why are their shifts different? Because one is more deshielded than the other, perhaps due to the substituents around.

So, for instance, if one of the vinylic protons is next to a CH3 group, it would be more deshielded. Or perhaps the substituents are on different sides.

Wait, going back to the NMR data:

7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz.

5.5 ppm: 1H, dq.

So the 7.0 is more deshielded than the 5.5, which suggests that the proton at 7.0 is in a different environment.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 and the CH.

Wait, but wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, in that case, the CH2 would be attached to the OAc, and the CH would be part of the double bond.

So the double bond would be between C2 and C3.

In that structure, the CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the CH (C2) proton.

The CH (C2) would be coupled to the CH2 and maybe to another group, like the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 5.5 ppm as a dq, which could be the CH proton. The CH2 would have two protons, which would be a triplet, but in the data, I don't see a triplet for 2H. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split into a quartet, but that's not in the data.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for the downfield signals. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which is quite downfield for a proton, so it might be a trans coupling in a conjugated system.

Looking at the options, if it's a trans configuration, then the substituents opposite each other would cause a larger J value.

Also, the presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H suggests that the CH3 is not next to any protons, so it's either an OAc group or a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm doublet for 3H: that's a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a CH3-CH where the CH is part of a double bond.

So, putting this together, perhaps the structure has a CH3-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm (d) for 3H suggests that the CH3 is adjacent to a CH group, which is part of a double bond.

So the structure could be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but with a substituent.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let's consider the possible structures:

Cis-propenyl acetate: Structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the double bond being cis.

Trans-propenyl acetate: Same structure but trans configuration.

Cis-butenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (but that's longer), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another way: the presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl, so that's clear.

The 1.6 ppm (d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So if the CH is part of a double bond, that would make the structure something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the OAc is on the CH2 group. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the CH2-OAc would have two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH=CH2.

But the NMR shows only one peak at 5.5, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the coupling in the structure.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the adjacent CH. The CH would be split by the CH2 and perhaps the CH2-OAc.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The CH2-OAc is C1, and the double bond is C2=C3.

So the CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the CH (C2) proton. The CH (C2) would be coupled to the CH2 (C1) and perhaps the CH2 (C3).

Wait, but in that case, the CH (C2) would be adjacent to CH2 (C3), which is CH2 connected to nothing else. So the CH (C2) would have coupling with the two protons on C1 and the two on C3, perhaps leading to a quartet. But the NMR shows a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons on the CH2 (C3) are split into a triplet by the adjacent CH (C2).

In this structure, the protons on C1 (CH2) would be a triplet (coupled to the CH on C2), and the CH on C2 would be a quartet (coupled to the two protons on C1 and the two on C3). But the NMR data doesn't show a triplet for 2H. Instead, the 5.5 peak is a dq, which might fit.

Wait, but the NMR shows only two peaks for the vinylic protons: 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq). So perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic protons is coupled to another proton, and the other is coupled to two different sets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a butenyl with a substituent, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis). The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on either side are cis, so the two CH2 groups are on the same side.

The vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. The C2 would have two protons, and the C3 would have one. Wait, no: CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So C2 is CH2 and C3 is CH.

Wait, no: CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 (middle of the chain).

In that case:

- The CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the adjacent CH (C2), leading to a triplet.

- The CH (C2) would have one proton, coupled to the CH2 (C1) and the CH2 (C3). But since C3 is CH2, each of its protons would couple to the C2 proton.

Wait, perhaps the C2 proton is split into a quartet (coupled to C1 and C3).

But in the NMR, the 5.5 peak is a dq, which could be due to coupling with two different sets of protons. So maybe the C2 proton is coupled to both the C1 and C3 protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3 (CH2) protons are a triplet, each coupled to the C2 proton.

But the NMR data shows a single peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a dq. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the splitting and the coupling constants.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, indicating trans coupling across a double bond.

So, the two vinylic protons are trans, which would make the structure trans. So the correct option would be either Trans-propenyl acetate or Trans-butenyl acetate.

Now, looking at the other signals:

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, if it's a CH that's coupled to a CH2 and another CH.

Wait, in the structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituents are trans, the C2 proton would be coupled to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH2), leading to a quartet perhaps, but in the NMR, it's a dq.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps that's the CH3 group on the CH2 next to the double bond.

Wait, if the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 with a trans configuration, then the CH2 (C1) would have two protons, each coupled to the C2 (CH) proton. The C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3. But in the NMR, we have a 5.5 ppm as a dq, which might fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the C2 and C3 being trans.

Wait, but in that case, the C2 would be CH, and C3 would be CH2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to assign the peaks.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) is one of the vinylic protons. Let's say that's the C3 proton, which is coupled to the C2 proton (trans), leading to a doublet.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) would be the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C1 CH2 (two protons) and perhaps the C3 CH2 (two protons), leading to a quartet. But in this case, it's a dq, so perhaps it's coupled to two different types of protons, like one coupling with J1 and another with J2.

Wait, but how does that fit with the structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, but that's longer than I'm considering.

Wait, another thought: in the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would have the OAc group on one end, and the double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on opposite sides.

So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but in the trans configuration.

In that case, the C2 would be a CH with substituents on opposite sides, leading to coupling with the C1 and C3.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is Trans-propenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the substituents on the CH=CH2 being trans.

In that case, the C2 (CH) and C3 (CH2) would have their protons trans coupled.

So, the C3 CH2 would have two protons (each coupled to the C2 CH), leading to a triplet. The C2 CH would be coupled to both C1 and C3, perhaps leading to a quartet.

But the NMR shows a 7.0 ppm (d) and a 5.5 ppm (dq). So perhaps the C3's protons are split into a triplet (but the NMR doesn't show a triplet), and the C2 proton is a quartet (but the NMR shows a dq).

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to imagine the coupling in the trans-propenyl structure.

In trans-propenyl acetate (OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, trans configuration), the C2 and C3 are trans.

So, the C2 proton would be trans to the C3's CH2 group.

The C2 proton would be coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons) and the C3's CH2 (two protons), leading to a quartet. But in the NMR, it's a dq, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the C2 proton is only coupled to the C3's CH2, leading to a triplet. But that doesn't match the NMR data either.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. The presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) is definitely the OAc methyl group.

The 1.6 ppm (d) for 3H suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond.

So, if the structure has a CH3-CH=CH-OAc group, then the CH3 would be attached to the CH, which is part of the double bond.

Wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that's not one of the options. The options are propenyl or butenyl acetates, without substituents like CH(CH3).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH3 is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the CH2-OAc is the end. So the CH2 has a CH3 attached elsewhere.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the integration.

The NMR has:

- 7.0 (1H)
- 5.5 (1H)
- 2.1 (3H)
- 1.6 (3H)

So total of 6H (I think), but the options are propenyl and butenyl, which would have 3 or 4 carbons respectively.

Wait, propenyl has three carbons, butenyl has four.

In the NMR, the 1.6 (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that's four carbons, so butenyl.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are either propenyl or butenyl, but without substituents.

So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. No, that's not matching either.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think about the coupling patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (J=16 Hz). That's a large coupling, so trans coupling across a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's a CH that's coupled to two different CH2 groups.

The 1.6 ppm (d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, but again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH3 is on the same carbon as the OAc.

Wait, but the OAc is a methyl group attached to oxygen, so that's a separate CH3.

So, going back. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm is attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, and the CH2 is connected to a CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. That's four carbons.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps it's better to think that the correct structure is a butenyl group with a CH3 attached to the CH adjacent to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the CH2 is connected to the OAc, and adjacent to the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 would have two protons, which are split by the adjacent CH (from the double bond). The CH would have one proton, which is split by the CH2 and perhaps another group.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 peak is a doublet, and the 5.5 is a dq.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 is the proton on the CH, and the 5.5 is the CH2. But the CH2 would be a triplet, which isn't in the data.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the large J (16 Hz) indicates trans coupling, which would be in the trans isomer.

So, between the options, the trans isomers are B (Trans-propenyl) and D (Trans-butenyl).

Now, looking at the remaining data: the 5.5 ppm is a dq. In a trans-propenyl structure, the CH would be coupled to the CH2, leading to a triplet or quartet. But the NMR shows a dq, which might fit a butenyl structure where the CH is coupled to two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is a proton that's coupled to two different protons, such as in a butenyl group where the CH is next to two different CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's a four-carbon chain (butenyl). In that case, the CH2 next to the double bond (C3) would have two protons, each coupled to the adjacent CH2 (C4), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq. Alternatively, the C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH2), leading to a quartet. But the NMR shows a dq.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, with the CH2-OAc having a CH3 attached elsewhere. But that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is trans-butenyl acetate, which would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond and trans configuration.

In that case, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure for trans-butenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is propenyl, but that's three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Cis-propenyl acetate, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the proton on the CH, and the 5.5 is the CH2, but I'm not matching this correctly.

Another approach: the presence of a doublet at 7.0 with J=16 Hz suggests that this proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is trans. So it's a vinylic proton with one coupling partner on the same double bond.

In propenyl acetate, the vinylic protons are two (on CH2 and CH). If the structure is trans, the protons on CH and CH2 would be trans, leading to each being a doublet.

So, in the NMR, we would see two doublets, each at around 5-6 ppm, but the data shows one at 7.0 and another at 5.5. That might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group with substituents. The NMR might show a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about the 5.5 ppm (dq). It's a doublet of quadruplets, which means it's split into two groups, each of which is further split into a quartet. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is a quartet, but it's written as a dq. So, maybe it's a quartet from coupling with two protons, each with different J values.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 is a proton that's coupled to two different protons with different J values, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

In the trans configuration, the coupling between the vinylic protons would be larger, so the 7.0 ppm is the trans-coupled proton, and the 5.5 is another proton that's coupled to two others.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: Structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis), but I'm not sure.

B) Trans-propenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans).

C) Cis-propenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis).

D) Trans-butenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the NMR shows a CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d), which would fit a structure where the CH3 is attached to a CH that's part of the double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl).

In that case, the CH3 would be on the end of the double bond. The CH adjacent to the double bond would have a CH3 attached, leading to the 1.6 ppm (d) for the CH3.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) would be the CH2=CH-CH(CH3) group. Wait, perhaps the CH on the double bond is attached to a CH3, leading to the 1.6 ppm signal.

So, in this case, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which is a butenyl group.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and C3 is attached to a CH3.

So, the protons on the double bond would be:

- C2: CH2, with two protons.

- C3: CH, attached to CH3.

But wait, the double bond would be CH2=CH-CH3, but that's a propene structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, making it a butenyl group with a CH3 on the end.

In this case, the C3 would be CH2, and the C4 would be CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me imagine the structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and C4 is CH3.

So, the protons on the double bond are:

- C2: CH2.

- C3: CH.

The C3 CH would have a proton that's coupled to the C2 CH2 and possibly the C4 CH3.

Wait, but the C4 is CH3, so the C3 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C2 (CH2) and perhaps any adjacent protons. But the NMR shows a 5.5 as a dq, which could be due to coupling with two different sets.

The C2 CH2 would have two protons, each coupled to the C3 CH.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet, which suggests a single coupling partner.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3 CH is coupled to both the C2 CH2 and the C4 CH3.

Wait, but the C4 is CH3, which is a single proton, so perhaps not.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the available data.

The presence of a large J (16 Hz) indicates a trans configuration, so the options are B or D.

Now, looking at the other signals:

The 5.5 ppm dq could be the CH in the middle of the double bond, coupled to two different protons (like two different CH2 groups).

The 1.6 ppm (d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond. So in a butenyl group, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, with the CH3 on the end.

In that case, the C3 would be CH, attached to CH3. So the C3 proton would be coupled to the C2 CH2 and possibly the C4 CH3.

Wait, but the CH3 is on C4, so perhaps the coupling would be J between C3 and C4?

But that's a single proton, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the 1.6 ppm (d) could be the CH3 attached to the C3 CH, making the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's not a double bond.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no. The large J suggests trans, so it's either B or D.

Another approach: the number of peaks in the NMR.

The NMR has four signals, which may correspond to:

- OAc methyl (s).

- CH3 attached to CH (d).

- Two vinylic protons (d and dq).

If the structure is propenyl, there would be only two vinylic protons, but in the NMR, we have two peaks for vinylic protons, which would fit.

But the CH3 at 1.6 could fit a propenyl structure if the CH3 is on the same carbon as the CH.

Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the CH2 would be connected to OAc, and the CH would be in the middle.

In that structure, the CH has one proton, and the adjacent CH2 has two protons.

So, the CH (C2) would be coupled to the CH2 (C1), leading to a triplet or quartet.

But the NMR shows the CH as a dq. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, which would have the CH and CH2 protons trans.

In that case, the CH would be a doublet (coupled to CH2), and the CH2 would be a triplet.

But the NMR shows a 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq), which doesn't match.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for the answer that fits the data, even if I'm not entirely sure.

The correct answer is either B or D.

The 1.6 ppm (d) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond. So, in a propenyl group, the CH would have one proton, and the CH2 would have two. But the NMR shows a dq for the CH, which may not fit.

In a butenyl group, the structure could have a CH attached to a CH2 and a CH3, leading to the CH3 as a doublet.

Hmm. I'm still not confident, but I think the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no. The J=16 suggests trans, so it's not cis. So the correct option is either B or D.

Given that, and the presence of a CH3 as a doublet, perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate.

So the answer would be option D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


The given 1H NMR data is analyzed to identify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The key observations and deductions are as follows:

1. **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This is the methyl group of the acetate group (OAc), which is typically a singlet due to the lack of neighboring protons.

2. **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This indicates a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to a double bond. This is consistent with a CH₃-CH=CH- structure.

3. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This signal corresponds to a vinylic proton (on a CH group) that is coupled to two different sets of protons, likely due to its position in the allylic system.

4. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This is a vinylic proton coupled to another proton across a double bond. The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) suggests a trans configuration of the double bond.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Cis-propenyl acetate**: In this structure, the double bond would have cis coupling, resulting in smaller coupling constants (J < 10 Hz). The observed J = 16 Hz rules out the cis configuration.

- **Trans-propenyl acetate**: This structure has a double bond with trans coupling, which matches the large J = 16 Hz. However, the splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) does not align well with the expected signals for trans-propenyl acetate.

- **Cis-butenyl acetate**: Similar to cis-propenyl acetate, the cis configuration would result in smaller coupling constants, inconsistent with the observed J = 16 Hz.

- **Trans-butenyl acetate**: This structure has a trans double bond, consistent with the large J = 16 Hz. The splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) can be explained by the vinylic proton coupling to two different sets of protons, as expected in a butenyl system. Additionally, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the CH group in the butenyl chain.

### Conclusion:
The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the splitting patterns in the NMR data strongly support the trans configuration. Furthermore, the presence of a CH₃ group attached to a CH group in the butenyl chain aligns with the structure of Trans-butenyl acetate.
