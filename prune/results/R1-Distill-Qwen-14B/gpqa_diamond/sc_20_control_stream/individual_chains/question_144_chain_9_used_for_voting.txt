Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me some parameters for a meson X. The production energy is 8 GeV, the mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is something like distance equals (velocity multiplied by lifetime). But wait, how do I get the velocity and lifetime from the given data?

Let me think about what each of these parameters means. The production energy E_X is 8 GeV. But the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, so the meson is produced with some kinetic energy. But since the mass is 1.2 GeV and E_X is 8 GeV, that's much higher. Wait, maybe the production energy is the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic?

Oh wait, no, in particle physics, the energy E is the total energy, including rest mass and kinetic. So if E_X is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV, the kinetic energy is 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV. But I'm not sure if I need that for this problem.

The width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I recall that the natural linewidth is related to the particle's lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where Γ is the width, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and τ is the mean lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

So to find the lifetime τ, I can use τ = ħ / Γ. Once I have τ, I need to find the velocity v of the meson to compute the distance. Because distance L = v * τ.

How do I find the velocity? Since the meson is moving with total energy E and mass m, I can use the relativistic equations. The energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p.

Let me plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Wait, but units in particle physics are often expressed in GeV and GeV/c² for mass. So I think when E is given in GeV, it's E = gamma m c². So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Therefore, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c. 

Wait, let's compute that. E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² is (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2, (m c²)^2 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44. So E² - (m c²)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2. So p c is sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me calculate that: sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Now, the momentum p is also related to the velocity v via p = gamma m v. Wait, but that's the relativistic momentum. Alternatively, I can find gamma from E. Since E = gamma m c², gamma is E / (m c²). So E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV, so gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta (β) is v/c, and beta can be found using gamma. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Rearranging, 1 - beta² = 1/gamma². So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Let me compute 1/gamma²: 1/(6.6667)^2 ≈ 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, meaning v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but maybe there's a more accurate way. Let me compute it more precisely. Let's calculate gamma:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666666666666667.

So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444444.

So 1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The sqrt of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, yes.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 * c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Let me compute τ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant in eV·s is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. So when in GeV, it's 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that:

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, the velocity v is beta * c. Let's compute v. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that exactly. 0.9887 * 3e8 = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = ?

Multiply the numbers: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let me compute that:

2.056875 * 3 is about 6.17, so 2.966 is a bit less. Let's do 2.056875 * 2.966.

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375

0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's see, 0.9 * 2.056875 is about 1.8511875, and 0.066 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.1356. So total is about 1.8511875 + 0.1356 ≈ 1.9868. So total is 4.11375 + 1.9868 ≈ 6.1005.

Wait, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because 2.056875 * 2.966 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 2.056875 * 2.966 ≈ 2.056875 * (3 - 0.034) ≈ 2.056875*3 = 6.170625 minus 2.056875 *0.034 ≈ 0.070. So about 6.170625 - 0.070 = 6.1006.

So the product is approximately 6.1006. The exponent is 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So altogether, 6.1006e-16 meters.

Wait, so L ≈6.1006e-16 m. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16, D is4.0655e-16. So 6e-16 isn't matching any option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the lifetime. Let me double-check. 

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds, correct.

And v is 0.9887 c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. So v is correct.

So L = v * τ = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Hmm, wait, 2.966 * 2.056875. Let me calculate this accurately.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ Let's compute 0.056875 * 3 = 0.170625, so 0.056875 *2.966 is about 0.056875 *3 minus 0.056875 * (3-2.966)= 0.170625 - 0.056875 *0.034.

Wait, maybe a better way. 0.056875 is 9/160. 2.966 * 9/160. Let me compute 2.966 *9=26.694, divided by 160 is 0.1668375.

So total 2.966 * 2.056875 = 5.932 + 0.1668375 ≈6.0988375.

So 6.0988e-16 m, which is approximately 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma or beta.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should compute gamma using E and m c², which are E =8 GeV and m c² =1.2 GeV. Gamma is E/(m c²) =8/1.2=6.666666667.

Then, beta can be found from gamma. Gamma=1/sqrt(1 -beta²). So sqrt(1 - beta²)=1/gamma → 1 - beta²=1/gamma² → beta²=1 -1/(gamma^2) → sqrt( 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) )

So substituting gamma=20/3, gamma^2=400/9, so 1/gamma^2=9/400=0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 -0.0225=0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887. So that seems correct.

Wait another thing: the width Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So tau is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but what about units? ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is indeed 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should compute the meson's velocity using another method. Let's think about the meson's energy and momentum again.

The energy E is 8 GeV. The momentum p is given by sqrt( (E^2 - (m c²)^2) )/(c²), but wait, not exactly. Let me think: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2) → p = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV / c → sqrt(62.56) GeV/c → approx 7.91 GeV/c.

So p =7.91 GeV/c.

The velocity can also be found via beta = (pc^2)/(E), because p = gamma m v, so beta = (pc^2)/(E). Let me check that.

Wait, p = gamma m v → beta = v/c = (p c)/(gamma m c²) ) = (p c)/(E).

So beta = p c / E. Since p c is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so beta =7.91 /8≈0.98875. Which matches what I had earlier. So that's correct, beta ≈0.98875, v≈0.98875 c.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value of beta without approximations.

Let me compute beta more precisely. Let's compute 7.91 /8.

7.91 divided by 8: 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So beta is 0.98875, so v is 0.98875 c.

So now, velocity is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

So v is correct.

Now, the lifetime is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So L = v * tau = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.96625 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely:

Let me break it down:

2.056875 * 2 =4.11375.

2.056875 * 0.96625 = ?

Wait, 2.056875 *0.9 = 1.8511875.

2.056875 *0.06625 = approximately 0.13636.

So 1.8511875 +0.13636≈1.9875475.

So total is 4.11375 +1.9875475≈6.1012975.

So 6.1013e-16 meters. Hmm, none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the width or the formula. Let me recheck.

Wait, another thought: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ via Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm given Γ in MeV, so I need to convert units properly.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s is 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, because 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV ·s =6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Ah, wait, I think I forgot to account for this when I calculated tau earlier. Oops! That's a critical mistake.

Because Γ is given in MeV, so using ħ in GeV·s may lead to unit inconsistency. Let me fix that.

So, ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 GeV·s * (1e3 MeV / 1 GeV) ) → 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320) seconds.

Compute 6.582e-22 / 320 → 6.582 /320 = approx 0.02056875 → 0.02056875e-22 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, same result as before. Oh, so no, the unit conversion doesn't affect the result because Γ is in MeV, and ħ was converted to MeV·s. So my initial calculation was correct.

Hmm, maybe I need to re-express everything in terms of meters and seconds correctly.

Wait, another thought: when I compute L = v * tau, maybe I need to consider the meson's speed in terms of c as beta c, so v = beta c. So perhaps I should re-calculate with beta more accurately.

Wait, let me compute beta more precisely. Since beta = pc/(E) = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875. So v = 0.98875 * c.

But perhaps I can compute beta more accurately using gamma.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So 1/gamma^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

Alternatively, let's calculate it with more precision. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

0.9775 is between 0.98^2 = 0.9604 and 0.99^2=0.9801. So let's see:

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

0.988^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.988^2:

0.988 *0.988 = (1 - 0.012)^2 =1 - 0.024 + 0.000144= 0.976144.

Wait, wait, that's not right. Because (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b², so 0.988 = 0.98 + 0.008. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.988 * 0.988.

Let me compute 988 *988:

988 *988 = ?

Well, 988^2 = (1000 -12)^2 = 1000000 - 2*1000*12 +12^2 = 1e6 -24000 +144 = 976144.

So 0.988^2 = (988/1000)^2 = (976144)/(1e6) ) = 0.976144.

Wait, but the square is 0.9775, so 0.988^2 is 0.976144 <0.9775. So need a higher value.

Let me compute 0.989^2:

= (0.988 +0.001)^2 =0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.001 + (0.001)^2= 0.976144 + 0.001976 + 0.000001= 0.978121.

Which is 0.978121, which is higher than 0.9775.

So 0.988^2= 0.976144 <0.9775 <0.989^2=0.978121.

So the square root is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Compute at 0.9885:

0.9885^2 = ?

Let me compute (0.988 +0.0005)^2 = 0.988² + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025= 0.97713225.

Still lower than 0.9775. So let's try 0.9887.

0.9887^2 = ?

Well, let me calculate it:

= (0.988 +0.0007)^2 = 0.988² + 2*0.988 *0.0007 + 0.0007²

= 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is 0.97752769, which is just above 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, back to L = v * tau.

v =2.9661e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= 2.9661e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this with more precision.

2.9661 * 2 =5.9322.

2.9661 *0.056875.

= 2.9661 * (56875/1e6) ) = let's compute 2.9661 * 56875e-6.

Alternatively, 0.056875 = 9/160.

So 2.9661 * (9/160) = (2.9661 * 9) /160.

2.9661 *9=26.6949.

26.6949 /160≈0.166843.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.166843 ≈6.099043.

So L=6.099043e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations or in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mean decay distance formula is different. Oh, wait! I think I forgot that the formula for decay length is L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, gamma is involved here! Because the meson is moving relativistically, so perhaps the proper lifetime is multiplied by gamma and then by speed.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Γ. The observed lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So the mean path length is L = v * gamma tau_0.

Which is same as v * tau, since tau = gamma tau_0.

So that's what I did earlier. So my approach was correct.

But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666666666666667.

So gamma = 20/3 ≈6.666666666666667.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculations for beta.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, E =8 GeV, m c²=1.2 GeV. So (m c²/E)^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2=0.0225.

So 1-0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887. So beta is 0.9887, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for L should be done with more precise constants. Let me use exact Planck's constant.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 /0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875 → so tau=20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Now, L= v * tau = (0.9887 *3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

So 0.9887 *3e8=2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.9661e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875 )e-16.

As done before, 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈6.099.

So L≈6.099e-16 m.

Looking at the options, the closest would be none, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using more precise beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately. Let's calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.988721.

So beta=0.988721, so v=0.988721 *3e8=2.966163e8 m/s.

Then, L=2.966163e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966163 *2.056875 )e-16.

Compute 2.966163 *2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely:

2.056875 *2.966163:

Breaking it down:

2.056875 * 2 =4.11375.

2.056875 *0.966163.

Compute 2.056875 *0.9=1.8511875.

2.056875 *0.066163≈ Let's compute 0.066163 *2.056875.

2.056875 * 0.06 =0.1234125.

2.056875 *0.006163≈ approx 0.012658.

So 0.1234125 +0.012658 ≈0.1360705.

So 2.056875 *0.966163 ≈1.8511875 +0.1360705 =1.987258.

So total L=4.11375 +1.987258 ≈6.09899.

So L≈6.099e-16 m.

Hmm, again no option matches. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. What else could affect the decay length?

Wait, another thought: The decay width is Γ, but the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ /Γ. Then, the observed lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0. So the decay length is L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate beta gamma as a separate factor.

Since gamma =20/3 ≈6.666666667.

Beta is 0.988721.

So beta gamma =6.666666667 *0.988721 ≈6.666666667 *0.988721.

Compute that:

6.666666667 *0.9 =6.

6.666666667 *0.08 =0.533333333.

6.666666667 *0.008721= approx 0.05814.

So total is 6 +0.533333333=6.533333333 +0.05814≈6.59147.

So beta gamma ≈6.59147.

Then, L=beta gamma c tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau_0 = ħ / Γ =6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.59147 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers:

6.59147 *3e8 =1.977441e9 m/s.

Then, 1.977441e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = 1.977441e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.977441 *2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977441 *2.056875.

1.977441 *2 =3.954882.

1.977441 *0.056875 ≈0.111892.

So total ≈3.954882 + 0.111892= 4.066774.

So L≈4.066774e-15 meters.

Ah! Now that's about 4.066e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option A is5.0223e-16 m.

So 4.066e-15 m is close to option B (4.0655e-15). So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not considering the beta gamma factor correctly.

Wait, wait, I think I see where I went wrong. Earlier, I used L = v * tau, which is correct, but perhaps I didn't correctly compute v. Because v is beta c, and tau is gamma tau_0, so L = beta c * gamma tau_0 = beta gamma c tau_0, which is what I calculated later.

In the earlier approach, I computed v as beta c and tau as gamma tau_0, so L = v * tau = beta c gamma tau_0. Which is the same as the second approach.

So why did the first calculation give 6e-16 and the second give 4e-15? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach's calculation of 2.966e8 *2.056e-24.

Wait, in the first approach, 2.966e8 is 2.966 *1e8.

2.966e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = 2.966 *2.056875 *1e-16.

Which is 6.099e-16 m.

But in the second approach, beta gamma is 6.59147, so L =6.59147 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

6.59147 *6.170625e-16 = approx 4.066e-15 m.

Wait, that's a big discrepancy. So why the two different results?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the first approach. Let me recompute 2.966e8 *2.056875e-24.

2.966e8 =2.966 *1e8.

2.056875e-24 =2.056875 *1e-24.

Multiply 2.966 *2.056875 = let's compute exactly.

2.966 *2 =5.932.

2.966 *0.056875:

0.05 *2.966=0.1483.

0.006875 *2.966=0.0203675.

So 0.1483 +0.0203675 =0.1686675.

So total 5.932 +0.1686675=6.0996675.

So 6.0996675e-16 m.

But in the second approach, when I did beta gamma, I got 4.066e-15 m. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me recompute beta gamma.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )=sqrt(1 - 0.0225 )=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988721.

So beta gamma =6.666666667 * 0.988721 ≈6.666666667 *0.988721.

Compute:

6 *0.988721=5.932326.

0.666666667 *0.988721≈0.658747.

So total is5.932326 +0.658747=6.591073.

So beta gamma≈6.591073.

Now, c is3e8 m/s, tau_0=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= beta gamma c tau_0 =6.591073 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Then, 6.591073 *6.170625e-16 = (6.591073 *6.170625 )e-16.

Calculate 6.591073 *6.170625.

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170625=1.02375.

0.591073 *6=3.546438.

0.591073 *0.170625≈0.1007.

So summing these parts:

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170625=1.02375.

0.591073 *6=3.546438.

0.591073 *0.170625≈0.1007.

So total approx 36 +1.02375=37.02375 +3.546438=40.570188 +0.1007≈40.670888.

Wait, that can't be right because 6.591 *6.170625 is around 40.67, but that would make L ≈40.67e-16=4.067e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Ah, so why did the first approach give 6.099e-16 m? Because I must have made a mistake in the first approach. Let me recheck.

In the first approach, I calculated L = v * tau, which is correct.

v is 0.988721 *3e8 m/s =2.966163e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L=2.966163e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.966163 *2.056875 )e-16.

Which is approximately 6.099e-16 m.

Wait, but according to the second approach, it should be 4.06e-15 m.

This inconsistency suggests I made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps in the first approach, I forgot that the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Γ, and the observed lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. So tau is gamma times tau_0.

Wait, but in the first approach, I calculated tau as ħ / Γ, which is tau_0. But no, because tau_0 is ħ /Γ, and the observed tau is gamma tau_0.

Wait, no! Because the mean lifetime as observed is longer by a factor gamma. So tau = gamma * tau_0.

In the first approach, I used tau = ħ /Γ, which is tau_0. So I think that's the error. Because the actual lifetime used should be tau = gamma * tau_0.

Ah! That's where I went wrong.

So in the first approach, I used tau = tau_0, but it should be tau = gamma * tau_0.

So let me correct that.

Tau_0 = ħ /Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / (0.32 GeV )=2.056875e-24 s.

Tau = gamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s ≈6.666666667 *2.056875e-24 ≈1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, 20/3 is about 6.666666667.

So 6.666666667 *2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = v * tau = (2.966163e8 m/s ) * (1.37125e-23 s )= 2.966163 *1.37125e-15.

Compute 2.966163 *1.37125.

1.37125 *2 =2.7425.

1.37125 *0.966163 ≈1.37125 *0.96 =1.314, 1.37125 *0.006163≈0.008408. So total ≈1.314 +0.008408=1.322408.

So total is 2.7425 +1.322408=4.064908.

So L=4.064908e-15 m, which is approximately 4.065e-15 m.

That's exactly option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the meson as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the meson,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{20}{3} \), we find:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5915.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma \approx 6.5915 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5915 \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}).
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Now multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.5915 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
