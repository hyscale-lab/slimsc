Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. Also, since acetic acid is a weak acid and HCl is a strong acid, while Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, this could get a bit tricky.

First, I think I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each solution. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react, and any excess will determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate moles for each component:**

Starting with the acetic acid. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But for moles, I can just calculate the total moles present. The formula is moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Barium hydroxide dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each unit gives two OH^- ions. So, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH^-.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So, OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, the H+ from the acids and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from CH3COOH and HCl: CH3COOH contributes 0.05 moles, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. Oh wait, but for the purpose of neutralization with a strong base, the H+ from the weak acid is negligible compared to the strong acid and base? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Or wait, maybe I should consider all H+ sources.

Wait no, perhaps I should treat all H+ as available. Wait, no, because in reality, the acetic acid only donates some H+ because it's weak. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to consider all H+ (from HCl and dissociated acetic acid) and all OH- (from Ba(OH)2), then see the excess.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ contributed by all sources except the weak acid, and then see what's left after neutralization.

Wait, maybe I should first calculate all the H+ and OH- in the mixture, considering that HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and acetic acid is weak.

So:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH contributes some H+ but since it's weak, maybe only a small amount compared to the strong acid and base. But wait, when you mix all solutions, the acetic acid may dissociate a bit more due to the presence of OH- from the base? Not sure. Maybe it's better to first calculate the total H+ and OH- contributions from all sources, ignoring the weak acid's dissociation, and then see the reaction.

Wait, but the problem is that when you mix all the solutions, the H+ and OH- will react. The Ba(OH)2 provides a lot of OH-.

So total H+:

HCl gives 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH gives some H+; but as it's weak, perhaps the H+ from it is negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Or does it contribute significantly? Hmm. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should assume that all the H+ comes from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then the acetic acid is left as CH3COO-.

Wait, no. Because the acetic acid can donate H+ as well, but since it's weak, perhaps in the presence of excess OH- from the base, most of it will deprotonate to form acetate ions.

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a neutralization reaction between all the H+ sources and OH-.

So, total H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, which doesn't dissociate completely. However, when you mix it with a strong base, the base will deprotonate some of the acetic acid.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it only donates a little H+. But when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with H+ from all sources.

Wait, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Because HCl is 0.08 moles H+, which is a lot more than the 0.05 from acetic acid.

Wait, but the Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 mol, which provides 0.18 mol of OH-.

So, let's compute total H+ and OH-:

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+.

But CH3COOH's H+ is much less than that of HCl. So perhaps for initial approximation, the H+ is about 0.08 + some small amount from CH3COOH. But maybe the 0.08 is the main H+ source.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- before any reaction, then subtract to find the excess. The excess will determine the pH.

So:

Total H+ before reaction:

HCl contributes 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH contributes 0.05 mol (but only a small amount dissociates; but wait, in this case, when mixed with OH-, the OH- will deprotonate some of the CH3COOH. So perhaps I should treat CH3COOH as a source of H+ and OH- as a base, and they'll react.

Wait, perhaps I should treat all H+ (including from CH3COOH) and all OH- and see what's left.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the initial H+ it provides is less than its concentration. Wait, perhaps to find the exact H+ and OH- after neutralization, I need to consider all sources.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the reaction as:

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+ (but only a small amount from the latter).

Total OH- = Ba(OH)2's OH-.

Then, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

The moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08, and from CH3COOH, perhaps around 0.05 (but only a fraction because it's weak). Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is minimal compared to HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- without considering the weak acid's contribution, then see if there's an excess of H+ or OH-.

Wait, let me proceed.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, H+ + OH- → H2O.

0.08 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH-.

So, the H+ would be consumed first by the OH-.

0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

So, in this initial calculation, the OH- is in excess by 0.10 mol.

But wait, this is ignoring the H+ from CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH can contribute H+ which would react with OH-.

So, including that:

CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all of its H+. So how much H+ can it contribute?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ sources:

- HCl: 0.08 mol.
- CH3COOH: Let's assume it contributes 'x' mol of H+.

OH- sources:

- Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, the reaction is: x H+ (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (HCl) + 0.18 (OH-) → ?

Wait, no. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ available is (0.08 + x), and the OH- is 0.18.

So, when they react, if (0.08 + x) < 0.18, then OH- is in excess, and the solution will be basic.

If (0.08 + x) > 0.18, then H+ is in excess, solution acidic.

But what is x? The H+ from CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, x is much less than 0.05, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it's negligible.

Wait, but the presence of OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH? Because OH- is a strong base and will take H+ from any available source.

So the CH3COOH will react with OH-.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce acetate.

So, the moles of OH- is 0.18, and CH3COOH is 0.05.

So, OH- can react with all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate.

So, after this reaction, the OH- remaining would be 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 moles.

Then, the HCl's H+ would react with the remaining OH-.

HCl provides 0.08 H+.

So, 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, in the end, we have 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 first reacts with the CH3COOH to form acetate, then reacts with the HCl's H+.

So, let's summarize:

1. CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with OH- (0.18 mol) → produces 0.05 mol acetate, uses up 0.05 mol OH-.

   Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 mol.

2. HCl's H+ (0.08 mol) reacts with remaining OH- (0.13 mol).

   Uses up 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol of OH-.

Wait, but what about the volumes? The total volume is the sum of all the solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

So, the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the steps because I might have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the reaction is more correctly handled by considering all H+ and OH- together.

The total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 mol H+.

The total moles of OH- is 0.18.

So, H+ + OH- → H2O.

0.13 H+ reacts with 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 OH-.

Then, the same result.

Wait, but that approach ignores the fact that CH3COOH is a weak acid, so not all of its H+ is available. Hmm. So perhaps that's incorrect. Because in reality, CH3COOH doesn't release all 0.05 mol of H+.

Wait, so perhaps the first approach where the OH- reacts with CH3COOH first, and then the remaining OH- reacts with HCl's H+ is more accurate.

So, in that case, the total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

So, as per that, the OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = approx 0.04167 M.

Which gives pOH of about 1.38, pH is 12.62.

So, the answer should be A) 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid, but the extent depends on the strength. But perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the initial H+ from all sources but the exact amount from CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps another way: The initial H+ is from HCl and some from CH3COOH, but the OH- will neutralize as much as possible.

Wait, let's calculate the exact moles.

Total H+ available = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+.

HCl: 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol, but since it's a weak acid, the H+ it contributes is much less than 0.05. But when you mix it with a strong base, the OH- will react with it.

So, the OH- will first react with the H+ from CH3COOH, but since CH3COOH is weak, the H+ is not fully available. So perhaps the reaction is more accurately described as OH- reacting with the CH3COOH to form acetate.

So, the OH- neutralizes the CH3COOH first, then any remaining OH- neutralizes the H+ from HCl.

So, the initial OH- is 0.18 mol.

CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. Each mole of OH- can take one mole of CH3COOH to form acetate.

So, 0.05 mol of OH- reacts with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, leaving 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.13 mol) reacts with HCl's H+ (0.08 mol).

So, 0.08 mol OH- reacts, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L. So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So yes, the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions and their neutralization reactions:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since CH₃COOH is weak, it contributes a small amount of H⁺, but its dissociation is negligible compared to the strong acid and base.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ react with the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH.
   - **Step 1:** OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH.  
     CH₃COOH contributes \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺, and OH⁻ reacts with this H⁺, leaving \( 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.
   - **Step 2:** Remaining OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl.  
     HCl contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺, and OH⁻ reacts with this H⁺, leaving \( 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

3. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - pOH = \( -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. Also, since acetic acid is a weak acid and HCl is a strong acid, while Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, this could get a bit tricky.

First, I think I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each solution. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react, and any excess will determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate moles for each component:**

Starting with the acetic acid. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But for moles, I can just calculate the total moles present. The formula is moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Barium hydroxide dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each unit gives two OH^- ions. So, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH^-.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So, OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, the H+ from the acids and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from CH3COOH and HCl: CH3COOH contributes 0.05 moles, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. Oh wait, but for the purpose of neutralization with a strong base, the H+ from the weak acid is negligible compared to the strong acid and base? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Or wait, maybe I should consider all H+ sources.

Wait no, perhaps I should treat all H+ as available. Wait, no, because in reality, the acetic acid only donates some H+ because it's weak. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to consider all H+ (from HCl and dissociated acetic acid) and all OH- (from Ba(OH)2), then see the excess.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ contributed by all sources except the weak acid, and then see what's left after neutralization.

Wait, maybe I should first calculate all the H+ and OH- in the mixture, considering that HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and acetic acid is weak.

So:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH contributes some H+ but since it's weak, maybe only a small amount compared to the strong acid and base. But wait, when you mix all solutions, the acetic acid may dissociate a bit more due to the presence of OH- from the base? Not sure. Maybe it's better to first calculate the total H+ and OH- contributions from all sources, ignoring the weak acid's dissociation, and then see the reaction.

Wait, but the problem is that when you mix all the solutions, the H+ and OH- will react. The Ba(OH)2 provides a lot of OH-.

So total H+:

HCl gives 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH gives some H+; but as it's weak, perhaps the H+ from it is negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Or does it contribute significantly? Hmm. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should assume that all the H+ comes from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then the acetic acid is left as CH3COO-.

Wait, no. Because the acetic acid can donate H+ as well, but since it's weak, perhaps in the presence of excess OH- from the base, most of it will deprotonate to form acetate ions.

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a neutralization reaction between all the H+ sources and OH-.

So, total H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, which doesn't dissociate completely. However, when you mix it with a strong base, the base will deprotonate some of the acetic acid.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it only donates a little H+. But when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with H+ from all sources.

Wait, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Because HCl is 0.08 moles H+, which is a lot more than the 0.05 from acetic acid.

Wait, but the Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 mol, which provides 0.18 mol of OH-.

So, let's compute total H+ and OH-:

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+.

But CH3COOH's H+ is much less than that of HCl. So perhaps for initial approximation, the H+ is about 0.08 + some small amount from CH3COOH. But maybe the 0.08 is the main H+ source.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- before any reaction, then subtract to find the excess. The excess will determine the pH.

So:

Total H+ before reaction:

HCl contributes 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH contributes 0.05 mol (but only a small amount dissociates; but wait, in this case, when mixed with OH-, the OH- will deprotonate some of the CH3COOH. So perhaps I should treat CH3COOH as a source of H+ and OH- as a base, and they'll react.

Wait, perhaps I should treat all H+ (including from CH3COOH) and all OH- and see what's left.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the initial H+ it provides is less than its concentration. Wait, perhaps to find the exact H+ and OH- after neutralization, I need to consider all sources.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the reaction as:

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+ (but only a small amount from the latter).

Total OH- = Ba(OH)2's OH-.

Then, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

The moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08, and from CH3COOH, perhaps around 0.05 (but only a fraction because it's weak). Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is minimal compared to HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- without considering the weak acid's contribution, then see if there's an excess of H+ or OH-.

Wait, let me proceed.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, H+ + OH- → H2O.

0.08 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH-.

So, the H+ would be consumed first by the OH-.

0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

So, in this initial calculation, the OH- is in excess by 0.10 mol.

But wait, this is ignoring the H+ from CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH can contribute H+ which would react with OH-.

So, including that:

CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all of its H+. So how much H+ can it contribute?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ sources:

- HCl: 0.08 mol.
- CH3COOH: Let's assume it contributes 'x' mol of H+.

OH- sources:

- Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, the reaction is: x H+ (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (HCl) + 0.18 (OH-) → ?

Wait, no. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ available is (0.08 + x), and the OH- is 0.18.

So, when they react, if (0.08 + x) < 0.18, then OH- is in excess, and the solution will be basic.

If (0.08 + x) > 0.18, then H+ is in excess, solution acidic.

But what is x? The H+ from CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, x is much less than 0.05, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it's negligible.

Wait, but the presence of OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH? Because OH- is a strong base and will take H+ from any available source.

So the CH3COOH will react with OH-.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce acetate.

So, the moles of OH- is 0.18, and CH3COOH is 0.05.

So, OH- can react with all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate.

So, after this reaction, the OH- remaining would be 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 moles.

Then, the HCl's H+ would react with the remaining OH-.

HCl provides 0.08 H+.

So, 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, in the end, we have 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 first reacts with the CH3COOH to form acetate, then reacts with the HCl's H+.

So, let's summarize:

1. CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with OH- (0.18 mol) → produces 0.05 mol acetate, uses up 0.05 mol OH-.

   Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 mol.

2. HCl's H+ (0.08 mol) reacts with remaining OH- (0.13 mol).

   Uses up 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol of OH-.

Wait, but what about the volumes? The total volume is the sum of all the solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

So, the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the steps because I might have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the reaction is more correctly handled by considering all H+ and OH- together.

The total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 mol H+.

The total moles of OH- is 0.18.

So, H+ + OH- → H2O.

0.13 H+ reacts with 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 OH-.

Then, the same result.

Wait, but that approach ignores the fact that CH3COOH is a weak acid, so not all of its H+ is available. Hmm. So perhaps that's incorrect. Because in reality, CH3COOH doesn't release all 0.05 mol of H+.

Wait, so perhaps the first approach where the OH- reacts with CH3COOH first, and then the remaining OH- reacts with HCl's H+ is more accurate.

So, in that case, the total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

So, as per that, the OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = approx 0.04167 M.

Which gives pOH of about 1.38, pH is 12.62.

So, the answer should be A) 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid, but the extent depends on the strength. But perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the initial H+ from all sources but the exact amount from CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps another way: The initial H+ is from HCl and some from CH3COOH, but the OH- will neutralize as much as possible.

Wait, let's calculate the exact moles.

Total H+ available = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+.

HCl: 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol, but since it's a weak acid, the H+ it contributes is much less than 0.05. But when you mix it with a strong base, the OH- will react with it.

So, the OH- will first react with the H+ from CH3COOH, but since CH3COOH is weak, the H+ is not fully available. So perhaps the reaction is more accurately described as OH- reacting with the CH3COOH to form acetate.

So, the OH- neutralizes the CH3COOH first, then any remaining OH- neutralizes the H+ from HCl.

So, the initial OH- is 0.18 mol.

CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. Each mole of OH- can take one mole of CH3COOH to form acetate.

So, 0.05 mol of OH- reacts with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, leaving 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.13 mol) reacts with HCl's H+ (0.08 mol).

So, 0.08 mol OH- reacts, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L. So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So yes, the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions and their neutralization reactions:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since CH₃COOH is weak, it contributes a small amount of H⁺, but its dissociation is negligible compared to the strong acid and base.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ react with the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH.
   - **Step 1:** OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH.  
     CH₃COOH contributes \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺, and OH⁻ reacts with this H⁺, leaving \( 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.
   - **Step 2:** Remaining OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl.  
     HCl contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺, and OH⁻ reacts with this H⁺, leaving \( 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

3. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - pOH = \( -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
