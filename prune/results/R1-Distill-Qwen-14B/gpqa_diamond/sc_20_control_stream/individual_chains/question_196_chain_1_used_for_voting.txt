Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to consider relativistic effects. Oh right, relativistic speeds come into play when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so we can't use the classical formulas directly.

Let me recall the basics. In a simple harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So the total energy in the oscillator would be the sum of kinetic and potential. At the maximum speed position, the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), so all the energy is kinetic. But wait, that's the case in the classical scenario. In the relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, but since the oscillator is moving, its kinetic energy would be at its maximum.

Wait, no, wait. In the oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x=A) and zero at the equilibrium (x=0). So when the oscillator passes through x=0, the velocity is maximum. So in that case, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential energy is zero.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is more than the classical value. So the total energy E would be equal to the kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, but wait again. The total energy of the harmonic oscillator in classical mechanics is (1/2)kA². That's the potential energy at maximum displacement, which equals the kinetic energy at maximum velocity. So in relativity, the total energy is the same as in the classical case? Or is it different?

No, because in relativity, as the mass moves at higher speeds, the total energy would include relativistic effects. Hmm, this is where I get a bit stuck. Let me think.

Wait, in the problem statement, the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential is (1/2)kx², same as the classical case. But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy E is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy? Or is it just the kinetic energy? I'm not sure. Wait, the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = γmc² = (γ - 1)mc² + mc².

But in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is all potential when the oscillator is at x = A, and all kinetic when it's at x=0.

So perhaps in the relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus mc²? Or is it different?

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. I think I need to set the total energy equal to the sum of kinetic and potential.

Wait, no. Let's approach this systematically. The total mechanical energy in the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. In the classical case, this sum is constant and equal to (1/2)kA².

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². The potential energy is (1/2)kx².

So at maximum speed, the oscillator is at x=0, so potential energy is zero. Then, the kinetic energy must equal the total mechanical energy.

But what is the total mechanical energy here? Is it the same as the classical case? Or does it change because of relativistic effects?

Hmm. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)kA² in classical mechanics. I'm not sure if that's the same in relativity. Because when you have relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is higher. So perhaps the total energy in the relativistic case would be higher.

Alternatively, maybe the energy is the same, but the relation between kinetic and potential energy changes. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think about the energy conservation. The total energy should be the same at all points in the oscillator's motion, provided no other forces are acting.

So the total energy E would be the sum of kinetic and potential energies at any point.

At x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero (classically). Relativistically, at x = A, the speed is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero (since v=0 implies γ=1, so KE = 0). So E = (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is E. So in the relativistic case, E must be equal to (γ - 1)mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc².

But wait, that can't be right because in the classical case, E is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy (1/2)mv²_max. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is higher.

Wait, but if E is (1/2)kA², which is the same as in the classical case, then (γ -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So solving for γ.

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2 / c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for v_max.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, let me call it 'b' for simplicity.

b = (k A²) / (2 m c²)

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + b.

Take reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + b).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b)^2.

Rearranged,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2.

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2.

1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 = [ (1 + b)^2 -1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Which is [ (1 + 2b + b²) -1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Simplify numerator: 2b + b².

So,

v² = c² (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2.

But wait, b is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is a small quantity if the oscillator isn't moving at speeds near c. But perhaps we can expand this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it.

Wait, 2b + b² = b(2 + b) = b (2 + b).

But 1 + b is 1 + b.

Wait, let me substitute back.

v² = c² [ (2b + b²) / (1 + b )^2 ].

Factor numerator: b(2 + b) = b (b +2 )

Denominator: (1 + b)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ b (b + 2) ] / (1 + b)^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it differently.

Wait, let me compute (1 + b)^2:

(1 + b)^2 = 1 + 2b + b².

So, 2b + b² = (1 + 2b + b²) -1 = (1 + b)^2 -1.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the equation.

From earlier:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + b.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + b).

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2] = [ (1 + b)^2 -1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2b + b^2) - 1 = 2b + b².

So,

v²/c² = (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2.

Factor numerator:

b(2 + b) / (1 + b)^2.

Hmm. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [b (2 + b)] / (1 + b)^2 ) )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( b (2 + b) ) / (1 + b )

But since b is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is small unless A is very large.

Wait, but perhaps I can express this in terms of 1 - (1/(1 + b)^2) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for small b, (1 + b)^2 ≈ 1 + 2b.

But I don't think that's the case here, because b could be significant if k A² is large compared to m c². So perhaps that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, let me compute:

v^2 = c^2 [ (2b + b^2) ] / (1 + b)^2.

But 2b + b^2 = b (2 + b) = b (b + 2) = b (2 + b).

Hmm. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option C is sqrt(kA²/m), which is the classical result. So in relativity, C can't be correct because we have to account for the gamma factor.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me compute the denominator:

1 - (k A²)/(2m) = (2m - k A²)/(2m).

So, 1/(denominator) is (2m)/(2m -k A²).

So,

1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 = 1 + [ (2m)^2 ] / (2m - k A² )^2.

Not sure if that helps.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, the denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )).

So,

1 + 1/[ (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) ]

Which is [ (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

So numerator is 2 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ), denominator is same.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( [ 2 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ] / [1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ] )

Hmm, not sure if that's matching our earlier expression.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which would be 1 - [1/(1 + b )^2 ] where b = k A²/(2 m c^2 ).

Wait, but earlier, our expression for v²/c² was [ (2b + b²) ] / (1 + b )^2.

Which can be written as (b (2 + b)) / (1 + b)^2.

Hmm.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 +b )^2.

Wait, 1 - 1/(1 +b )^2 = [ (1 +b )^2 -1 ] / (1 +b )^2 = (1 + 2b + b² -1 ) / (1 +b )² = (2b + b² ) / (1 +b )².

Which is exactly what I have in v²/c².

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + b )^2 ].

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 +b )^2 ] )

Which is the same as option D, which is:

D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Yes! Because b is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so 1 + b is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )).

So the expression inside the square root becomes 1 - 1/(1 + b )^2.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, let me double-check. So our expression for v_max is c times sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + b )^2 ), which matches option D.

Yes, so the answer should be D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At the maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero (classically). Relativistically, the total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is expressed as:

\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor and \( v \) is the velocity. Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) to the potential energy at \( x = A \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( b = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + b}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + b)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + b)^2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + b)^2 - 1}{(1 + b)^2} = \frac{2b + b^2}{(1 + b)^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + b)^2}}
\]

Substituting \( b = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly use \( kA^2/(2m) \) or \( kA^2/(2mc^2) \) in the denominator without the correct relativistic factor.
- **Option C** is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
