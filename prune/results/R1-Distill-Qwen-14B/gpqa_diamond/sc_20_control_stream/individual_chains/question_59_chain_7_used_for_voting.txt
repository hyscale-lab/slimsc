Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, there are three solutions here, not just two. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let me jot those down.

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- ions will react. Oh, right, but I should separate the acids and bases.

Let's start with the acids. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Wait, but barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely. HCl is strong, so it will.

So, for each solution, find the moles.

Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). Oh, right, because M is moles per liter.

Calculating each:

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
Wait, no. 0.5 liters because 500 mL is 0.5 L. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Because 400 mL is 0.4 L.

3. Ba(OH)2: Let's see, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH^-.

So, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So OH- moles would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix them all together, the H+ from the acids and OH- from the base will react. Let me figure out how much H+ and OH- we have.

Wait, but the HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for calculating the initial moles of H+, I think I need to consider all sources.

Wait, no. Because when you mix them, the strong acids will contribute H+ immediately, and the weak acid will contribute some H+ but not all. Hmm, but maybe I need to consider the neutralization between the acids and the base first.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first figure out the net acid or base after the neutralization. The idea is that the OH- will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is weak. Hmm, maybe I should treat the HCl as a strong acid and the Ba(OH)2 as a strong base, and see if they neutralize each other, and then see what's left.

So, let me think: Initially, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. They will react as H+ + OH- → H2O.

Wait, but how much H+ do I have in total?

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it doesn't fully dissociate. But when mixed with a strong base, maybe it's a buffer situation. Hmm, but wait, the OH- from the base will react first with the H+ from the strong acid, and any remaining OH- will then react with the weak acid.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ from strong acids and the strong base's OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, but the problem is that we have a mixture, so all solutions are combined. Let's compute the total volume first.

Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Wait, but the order of mixing doesn't matter here because they're all in the same container.

So, let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 moles of H+. The CH3COOH contributes some H+ as it's a weak acid, but perhaps I should treat it as a source of H+ in a buffer solution.

Wait no, because when you add a strong base, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from the strong acid first, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid.

So, the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

The H+ comes from HCl: 0.08 moles, and from CH3COOH: let's say it's a weak acid, so perhaps we can approximate the H+ as negligible compared to the strong acid, but wait, that's not necessarily the case because the Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles of OH-, which is more than the HCl's 0.08 H+.

So, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl.

So, of the 0.18 moles OH-, 0.08 moles will react with HCl's H+. That leaves 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, what's left is 0.10 moles of OH- which will react with the acetic acid.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and it dissociates as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

So, when OH- is added, it will react with the H+ ions produced by the acetic acid. But since the OH- is in excess, it might deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid. Let me think: The moles of acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The OH- left is 0.10 moles.

So, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. Since we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-, all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the OH- can't just neutralize all the acetic acid. Let me think again.

In the presence of excess OH-, any weak acid (like acetic acid) will be deprotonated. So, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the moles of OH- after reacting with HCl is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, this 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the 0.05 moles of acetic acid. Since each OH- can take one H+ from the acetic acid, the acetic acid (0.05 moles) will be completely neutralized, and then there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

So, in the final solution, we have some excess OH-.

So, total moles of OH- after neutralization is 0.05 moles.

Then, the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. Because log(0.0416667) is about 1.38 (since 10^-1 is 0.1, 10^-2 is 0.01, 0.04 is between 1 and 2. So log(0.0416667) is about 1.38. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.0416667 is 1/24. Let me compute log(1/24) = log(0.0416667). The log of 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667) is approximately 0.62 (since 10^0.6 is about 3.98, 10^0.62 is about 4.17). So log(4.16667e-2) is 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38.

Then, pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutralization more carefully. Let me recount:

Total H+ (from HCl) is 0.08 moles.
Total OH- (from Ba(OH)2) is 0.18 moles.

So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Then, this OH- will react with the acetic acid. But wait, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. So, the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid.

Each mole of OH- can take one mole of H+ from CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will provide 0.05 moles of H+ (but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, so in reality, the H+ is less. But wait, when dealing with a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate all the acetic acid it can. So, the 0.10 moles of OH- will take 0.05 moles of H+ from the acetic acid, which is all of it, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, that's assuming that the acetic acid can donate a mole of H+ per mole. Which, in reality, it can't, because it's a weak acid and not all of it dissociates. But when a strong base is added, it will deprotonate the weak acid completely until the base is consumed or the acid is exhausted.

Wait, when you have a weak acid and add a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid until either the base is used up or the acid is all converted into its conjugate base. So in this case, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH to produce CH3COO^- and water.

So, with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-, the CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- will remain.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in a total volume of 1.2 L.

Thus, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. So pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me think differently. Another approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but that's tricky because the weak acid complicates things. Let me try.

The strong acids (HCl) contribute 0.08 moles H+.

The weak acid (CH3COOH) contributes some H+, but in this case, because we have a strong base, the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from the acid.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the net H+ and OH-.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach is correct, but I want to make sure.

Alternatively, think of the reaction as:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, their reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So, the mole ratio is 2 moles HCl to 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

But in our case, we have 0.08 moles HCl and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

Which is, 0.08 HCl : 0.09 Ba(OH)2.

So, the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Let me compute the moles needed for each:

Ba(OH)2 requires 2 HCl.

So, for 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, it would need 0.18 moles HCl.

But we only have 0.08 moles HCl. So, HCl is the limiting reactant.

So, HCl (0.08 moles) will react with Ba(OH)2 as follows:

(0.08 HCl) × (1 Ba(OH)2 / 2 HCl) ) = 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2 consumed.

So, after reaction, moles of Ba(OH)2 left: 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things since we have other sources of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right way, because in actuality, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 and H+ from HCl will neutralize each other, and the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me try a different method.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when we mix them, the OH- and H+ will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the H+ from HCl (0.08) will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.

So, OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the OH- will deprotonate it:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH is 0.05. The OH- is 0.10.

So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, total OH- in solution is 0.05 moles.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

Concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but another way to think about this: after neutralizing the HCl with Ba(OH)2, you have excess OH- that reacts with CH3COOH. But wait, what if the amount of OH- is more than the CH3COOH's H+?

Yes, that's exactly what's happening. So the remaining OH- after HCl neutralization is 0.10, which is more than the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So all of the CH3COOH's H+ is neutralized, and there's 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Therefore, the solution is basic, with OH- concentration 0.0416667 M, leading to pH 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, so that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains:

1. **500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid)**:  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so it will contribute some \( \text{H}^+ \) ions, but the extent depends on the neutralization with bases.

2. **400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)**:  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, contributing 0.08 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \).

3. **300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide)**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate, contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).

### Step 1: Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻
The \( \text{H}^+ \) ions from HCl (0.08 moles) will react with the \( \text{OH}^- \) ions from Ba(OH)₂. The reaction is:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
After neutralization:  
- \( \text{H}^+ \) remaining = \( 0.08 - 0.08 = 0 \, \text{moles} \).  
- \( \text{OH}^- \) remaining = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \) will react with CH₃COOH. The reaction is:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \), so all of it will be neutralized, leaving:  
\[
\text{OH}^- \, \text{remaining} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, there are three solutions here, not just two. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let me jot those down.

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- ions will react. Oh, right, but I should separate the acids and bases.

Let's start with the acids. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Wait, but barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely. HCl is strong, so it will.

So, for each solution, find the moles.

Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). Oh, right, because M is moles per liter.

Calculating each:

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
Wait, no. 0.5 liters because 500 mL is 0.5 L. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Because 400 mL is 0.4 L.

3. Ba(OH)2: Let's see, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH^-.

So, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So OH- moles would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix them all together, the H+ from the acids and OH- from the base will react. Let me figure out how much H+ and OH- we have.

Wait, but the HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for calculating the initial moles of H+, I think I need to consider all sources.

Wait, no. Because when you mix them, the strong acids will contribute H+ immediately, and the weak acid will contribute some H+ but not all. Hmm, but maybe I need to consider the neutralization between the acids and the base first.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first figure out the net acid or base after the neutralization. The idea is that the OH- will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is weak. Hmm, maybe I should treat the HCl as a strong acid and the Ba(OH)2 as a strong base, and see if they neutralize each other, and then see what's left.

So, let me think: Initially, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. They will react as H+ + OH- → H2O.

Wait, but how much H+ do I have in total?

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it doesn't fully dissociate. But when mixed with a strong base, maybe it's a buffer situation. Hmm, but wait, the OH- from the base will react first with the H+ from the strong acid, and any remaining OH- will then react with the weak acid.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ from strong acids and the strong base's OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, but the problem is that we have a mixture, so all solutions are combined. Let's compute the total volume first.

Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Wait, but the order of mixing doesn't matter here because they're all in the same container.

So, let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 moles of H+. The CH3COOH contributes some H+ as it's a weak acid, but perhaps I should treat it as a source of H+ in a buffer solution.

Wait no, because when you add a strong base, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from the strong acid first, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid.

So, the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

The H+ comes from HCl: 0.08 moles, and from CH3COOH: let's say it's a weak acid, so perhaps we can approximate the H+ as negligible compared to the strong acid, but wait, that's not necessarily the case because the Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles of OH-, which is more than the HCl's 0.08 H+.

So, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl.

So, of the 0.18 moles OH-, 0.08 moles will react with HCl's H+. That leaves 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, what's left is 0.10 moles of OH- which will react with the acetic acid.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and it dissociates as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

So, when OH- is added, it will react with the H+ ions produced by the acetic acid. But since the OH- is in excess, it might deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid. Let me think: The moles of acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The OH- left is 0.10 moles.

So, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. Since we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-, all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the OH- can't just neutralize all the acetic acid. Let me think again.

In the presence of excess OH-, any weak acid (like acetic acid) will be deprotonated. So, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the moles of OH- after reacting with HCl is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, this 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the 0.05 moles of acetic acid. Since each OH- can take one H+ from the acetic acid, the acetic acid (0.05 moles) will be completely neutralized, and then there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

So, in the final solution, we have some excess OH-.

So, total moles of OH- after neutralization is 0.05 moles.

Then, the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. Because log(0.0416667) is about 1.38 (since 10^-1 is 0.1, 10^-2 is 0.01, 0.04 is between 1 and 2. So log(0.0416667) is about 1.38. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.0416667 is 1/24. Let me compute log(1/24) = log(0.0416667). The log of 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667) is approximately 0.62 (since 10^0.6 is about 3.98, 10^0.62 is about 4.17). So log(4.16667e-2) is 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38.

Then, pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutralization more carefully. Let me recount:

Total H+ (from HCl) is 0.08 moles.
Total OH- (from Ba(OH)2) is 0.18 moles.

So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Then, this OH- will react with the acetic acid. But wait, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. So, the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid.

Each mole of OH- can take one mole of H+ from CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will provide 0.05 moles of H+ (but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, so in reality, the H+ is less. But wait, when dealing with a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate all the acetic acid it can. So, the 0.10 moles of OH- will take 0.05 moles of H+ from the acetic acid, which is all of it, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, that's assuming that the acetic acid can donate a mole of H+ per mole. Which, in reality, it can't, because it's a weak acid and not all of it dissociates. But when a strong base is added, it will deprotonate the weak acid completely until the base is consumed or the acid is exhausted.

Wait, when you have a weak acid and add a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid until either the base is used up or the acid is all converted into its conjugate base. So in this case, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH to produce CH3COO^- and water.

So, with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-, the CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- will remain.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in a total volume of 1.2 L.

Thus, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. So pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me think differently. Another approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but that's tricky because the weak acid complicates things. Let me try.

The strong acids (HCl) contribute 0.08 moles H+.

The weak acid (CH3COOH) contributes some H+, but in this case, because we have a strong base, the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from the acid.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the net H+ and OH-.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach is correct, but I want to make sure.

Alternatively, think of the reaction as:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, their reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So, the mole ratio is 2 moles HCl to 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

But in our case, we have 0.08 moles HCl and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

Which is, 0.08 HCl : 0.09 Ba(OH)2.

So, the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Let me compute the moles needed for each:

Ba(OH)2 requires 2 HCl.

So, for 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, it would need 0.18 moles HCl.

But we only have 0.08 moles HCl. So, HCl is the limiting reactant.

So, HCl (0.08 moles) will react with Ba(OH)2 as follows:

(0.08 HCl) × (1 Ba(OH)2 / 2 HCl) ) = 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2 consumed.

So, after reaction, moles of Ba(OH)2 left: 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things since we have other sources of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right way, because in actuality, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 and H+ from HCl will neutralize each other, and the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me try a different method.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when we mix them, the OH- and H+ will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the H+ from HCl (0.08) will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.

So, OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the OH- will deprotonate it:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH is 0.05. The OH- is 0.10.

So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, total OH- in solution is 0.05 moles.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

Concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but another way to think about this: after neutralizing the HCl with Ba(OH)2, you have excess OH- that reacts with CH3COOH. But wait, what if the amount of OH- is more than the CH3COOH's H+?

Yes, that's exactly what's happening. So the remaining OH- after HCl neutralization is 0.10, which is more than the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So all of the CH3COOH's H+ is neutralized, and there's 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Therefore, the solution is basic, with OH- concentration 0.0416667 M, leading to pH 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, so that's the answer.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains:

1. **500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid)**:  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so it will contribute some \( \text{H}^+ \) ions, but the extent depends on the neutralization with bases.

2. **400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)**:  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, contributing 0.08 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \).

3. **300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide)**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate, contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).

### Step 1: Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻
The \( \text{H}^+ \) ions from HCl (0.08 moles) will react with the \( \text{OH}^- \) ions from Ba(OH)₂. The reaction is:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
After neutralization:  
- \( \text{H}^+ \) remaining = \( 0.08 - 0.08 = 0 \, \text{moles} \).  
- \( \text{OH}^- \) remaining = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \) will react with CH₃COOH. The reaction is:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \), so all of it will be neutralized, leaving:  
\[
\text{OH}^- \, \text{remaining} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
