Okay, so I'm trying to find the partition function for this system of three spins. Let me see, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, wait, that formula looks familiar. Oh right, it's like the Ising model but with three spins.

I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all the possible states and their corresponding energies.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so three spins would have 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than just brute-forcing all 8 states. Maybe I can categorize them based on how many of the spins are aligned or something like that.

Wait, the Hamiltonian (energy) depends on the products of the spins. Let me calculate each term:

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 )

Hmm, so each term is the product of two spins. Let me think of each state as a triplet (S1, S2, S3).

Each term S_i S_j will be +1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different. So each of the three terms contributes +1 or -1.

Wait, but each S_i is either +1 or -1, so S_i S_j is (+1) if S_i = S_j, else (-1). So for each pair (like S1S2), it's either +1 or -1.

So each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be +1 or -1. So the sum [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] can take different values depending on how many pairs are the same.

Let me consider the possible values of the sum.

Let me denote the number of pairs that are aligned (same spins) as n. Each pair contributes +1 if aligned, -1 if not. So the sum would be n*(+1) + (3 - n)*(-1) = n - (3 - n) = 2n -3.

Wait, let me check. Suppose all three pairs are aligned. Then each term is +1, sum is 3. So 2n-3 = 3 → 2n=6 → n=3.

If two pairs are aligned, sum is 2n-3 = 4-3=1.

If one pair is aligned, sum is 2(1)-3 = -1.

If none are aligned, sum is -3.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think. Each pair can be either aligned or not. So for n=3, all pairs are aligned. So S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So sum is 3.

If two are aligned, sum is 2*(+1) + 1*(-1) = 2 -1 =1.

If one is aligned, sum 1*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 1-2 = -1.

If none aligned, sum -3.

So the possible values of the sum are 3,1,-1,-3.

Thus, the energy E for each case is:

E = -J * sum → E = -J * (2n -3).

Wait, but actually E is proportional to the sum. So for each state, depending on n, E will be:

When n=3 (all pairs aligned), sum is 3 → E= -J*3.

n=2, sum=1 → E= -J *1.

n=1, sum=-1 → E = J *1.

n=0, sum=-3 → E= 3J.

Wait, no:

Wait, E is -J*(sum). So for sum=3 → E = -3J.

sum=1 → E= -J.

sum=-1 → E= J.

sum=-3 → E=3J.

So each state will have an energy depending on the sum.

But how many states correspond to each sum?

Because the number of states with a particular value of sum depends on how many triplet states have that sum.

So, let me think:

First, all possible 8 states:

1. (1,1,1)
2. (1,1,-1)
3. (1,-1,1)
4. (1,-1,-1)
5. (-1,1,1)
6. (-1,1,-1)
7. (-1,-1,1)
8. (-1,-1,-1)

Now I can compute for each state what the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is.

Let me compute each one:

1. (1,1,1): S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3.

2. (1,1,-1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum=1-1-1= -1? Wait, no: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait wait, no, the sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1? Or wait, wait, no, let me compute each term:

S1S2 = 1*1=1.

S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1.

S2S3 =1*(-1) = -1.

So sum = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. (1,-1,1): same approach.

S1S2= (1)(-1)= -1.

S1S3=(1)(1)=1.

S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

Sum = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

E = J.

4. (1,-1,-1):

S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1.

S1S3= (1)(-1)=-1.

S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1= -1.

E= J.

5. (-1,1,1):

S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1.

S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

S2S3=1*1=1.

Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1= -1.

E= J.

6. (-1,1,-1):

S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1.

S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3=1*(-1)= -1.

Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

E= J.

7. (-1,-1,1):

S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1.

S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

E= J.

8. (-1,-1,-1):

All S_i S_j = 1.

Sum=3. E=-3J.

So how many states have each sum:

Sum=3: only state 1 and state 8. Wait, no, state 1 is (1,1,1), sum 3. State 8 is (-1,-1,-1), same as all spins same, sum 3 → yes.

So sum=3 → 2 states.

Sum=1: Let me check. Wait, I thought sum could be 3,1,-1,-3. But in the above, I don't see any states with sum 1.

Wait, in state 2: (1,1,-1) sum was -1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check state 2 again.

Wait state 2: (1,1,-1). Let's recompute the sum.

S1S2 =1*1=1.

S1S3=1*(-1)=-1.

S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.

Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

So sum=-1.

Hmm, so which states have sum=1? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3, but in the 8 states, I only found sum=3, sum=-1, and sum= -3? Because when I look through all states, some have sum=-3.

Wait wait, state 5: (-1,1,1).

S1S2= (-1)(1) = -1.

S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1.

S2S3=1*1=1.

Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

So all except state 1 and 8 have sum=-1.

Wait, wait, state 1: sum 3.

State 8: sum 3.

Other states: (1,1,-1), sum -1.

Wait, but I thought E= -J*(sum), so for sum=3, E= -3J; sum=-1, E= J; sum=-3, E=3J.

Wait, but wait, are there any states with sum=1 or sum=-3?

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe n is the number of pairs aligned (each pair being same). So for each state, how many pairs are aligned.

In state 1: all three spins same. So all three pairs are aligned → n=3.

So sum= 3.

In state 8: all same, so same as above.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7: each has two pairs anti-aligned, or something else.

Wait, let me take state 2: (1,1,-1).

The pairs:

S1 and S2: aligned → +1.

S1 and S3: not aligned → -1.

S2 and S3: not aligned → -1.

So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

So n=1 (only one pair aligned).

So the sum is 2n -3 → 2*1 -3 = -1. Which matches.

So for n=1, sum is -1.

Wait, but earlier I thought sum=3,1,-1,-3. But in these states, the only sums I see are 3 and -1 except for state 8.

Wait, what about a state where two pairs are aligned?

Let me think of a state where two pairs are aligned. For example:

(1,1,1): n=3.

Another example: (1,1, -1): n=1.

Wait, maybe a state with two aligned pairs. Let me think:

What about (1,1,1): all aligned.

What about (1,1, -1): only one pair aligned.

What about (1,-1,1): S1 and S3 are aligned, S1 and S2 are not, S2 and S3 are not. So n=1.

Hmm, how about a state that has two aligned pairs. Let me think: (1,1, -1) has one aligned pair. How about (1, -1, -1)?

Compute the pairs:

S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1 → not aligned.

S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1 → not aligned.

S2S3 = (-1)(-1) =1 → aligned.

So only one aligned pair → n=1.

Wait, another example: (1,-1,1).

Same as before, n=1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a state with two aligned pairs. Let me think.

Wait, maybe a state like (1,1, -1) has one aligned pair. But what about (1, -1, -1)? As above, only one aligned pair. Wait, what about (1, -1,1)? Let me compute:

S1S2 = 1*(-1) =-1 → not aligned.

S1S3 =1*1=1 → aligned.

S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1 → not aligned.

So two aligned pairs? No, only one. So n=1.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong in my initial approach. Maybe the number of aligned pairs can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Wait, but in reality, in three spins, can there be 2 aligned pairs?

Wait, consider state (1,1,-1). The S1 and S2 are aligned, but S1 and S3 are not, S2 and S3 are not. So n=1.

Another state: (1,-1,-1). S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. So only S2S3 is aligned. n=1.

Wait, perhaps in all cases except the all aligned and all anti-aligned, the number of aligned pairs is 1.

Wait, another state: (1, -1, -1) has only one aligned pair (S2S3).

What about (1,1,1): n=3.

And ( -1, -1, -1): n=3.

So, the only possible n values are 0,1,3? Because when n=2, perhaps it's impossible.

Wait, no. Let me think of a state where n=2. For three spins, if two of the pairs are aligned and one is not. Is that possible?

Wait, perhaps choosing S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

So n=1.

Wait, another approach: for three spins, the number of aligned pairs can be 0,1,2, or 3.

But perhaps n=2 is not possible for some reason.

Wait, perhaps for three spins, if two pairs are aligned, the third must also be aligned, leading to n=3.

Let me see: suppose S1S2=1 and S1S3=1. Then S2 must be equal to S1, and S3 must equal S1. So S2=S3. So S2S3=1. So n=3.

So in three spins, if two pairs are aligned, the third must also be aligned. Hence, n can't be 2. So possible n=0,1,3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if two of the pairs (like S1S2 and S1S3) are aligned, then S2 must be same as S1, and S3 same as S1. So S2 and S3 are same, so S2S3 is aligned. Thus, if two pairs are aligned, all three are aligned.

So, possible n=3,1,0.

Wait, but when n=3, sum=3.

n=1, sum=2(1)-3= -1.

n=0, sum= 2(0)-3=-3.

Wait, so the possible sums are 3, -1, -3.

But earlier, when I thought of the sum as being 3,1,-1,-3, that's not the case. So perhaps the sum can be 3, -1, or -3.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation of the 8 states, I saw sum=-1 in 6 states, sum=3 in 2, and sum=-3 in 0. Wait, that can't be. Because for state (1,1,1), sum is 3.

In state (1,1,-1), sum is -1.

In state (1,-1,-1), sum is -1.

Wait, what about state (-1, -1, 1): sum is ( (-1)(-1) ) + ( (-1)(1) ) + ( (-1)(1) ) = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

So all the other states (excluding the two all-aligned states) have sum=-1.

So what about sum=-3?

Wait, let's think of a state where all three pairs are anti-aligned (sum=-3). Can that happen?

Let's see. For sum to be -3, each pair must be anti-aligned, which would require that each pair of spins is opposite.

But with three spins, is that possible?

Let me try:

Suppose S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.

Then:

S1S2 = -1 → anti-aligned.

S1S3= 1 → aligned.

S2S3= -1 → anti-aligned.

Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

So sum is -1, not -3.

Another try: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2= -1.

S1S3= -1.

S2S3=1.

Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.

Hmm.

Another try: S1=1, S2=-1, S3= -1.

Wait, that's same as above.

Is there a state where all three pairs are anti-aligned?

Wait, that would require S1 != S2, S1 != S3, and S2 != S3.

But if S1 and S2 are opposite, S1 and S3 are opposite, then S2 and S3 must be the same as each other. Because S1 is opposite to both S2 and S3, so S2 and S3 must be same.

Wait, because S1 is opposite to S2 → S2 = -S1.

S1 is opposite to S3 → S3 = -S1.

So S2 = -S1, S3 = -S1 → S2 = S3. So S2 and S3 are same, so their product is 1.

Which means their pair is aligned, so sum can't be -3.

Thus, in three spins, it's impossible for all three pairs to be anti-aligned. Because the third spin would have to align with the first, making the second and third aligned, hence one pair aligned.

So, for three spins, the sum can't be -3. So the possible sums are 3, -1, and maybe 1? Or wait, did I miss any?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in the 8 states, are any of them sum=1 or sum=-3?

Looking back, state 2: (1,1,-1) sum=-1.

State 3: (1,-1,1) sum=-1.

State 4: (1,-1,-1) sum=-1.

State 5: (-1,1,1) sum=-1.

State 6: (-1,1,-1) sum=-1.

State 7: (-1,-1,1) sum=-1.

Wait, so all of these states have sum=-1, except the two all-same states which have sum=3.

So the sum can be 3 or -1.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of possible sums being 3,1,-1,-3, that was wrong. It's only 3 and -1.

Wait, that's not correct because when all three are aligned, sum=3. When any other state, sum=-1.

Wait, but in that case, the number of states with sum=3 is 2 (all +1 and all -1). The other 6 states have sum=-1.

So for the partition function, each state contributes exp(β E), where E is -J * sum.

So E for sum=3: E = -3J.

E for sum=-1: E = J.

So the partition function Z is sum of exp(β E) for all states.

So Z = (number of states with sum=3) * exp(β*(-3J)) + (number of states with sum=-1) * exp(β*J)

Which is Z = 2 * exp(-3J β) + 6 * exp(J β).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: Z=2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → matches.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → no.

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ} → no.

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ} → no.

So the correct partition function is 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Possible States and Energies
Each spin can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. The energy depends on the pairwise products \( S_iS_j \), which are \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned. The total energy is then \( E = -J \sum S_iS_j \), where the sum \( \sum S_iS_j \) can take specific values based on the number of aligned pairs.

### Step 2: Possible Values of \( \sum S_iS_j \)
The sum \( \sum S_iS_j \) can take the following values:
- **3**: All three pairs are aligned (e.g., \( (1,1,1) \) or \( (-1,-1,-1) \)).
- **-1**: Exactly one pair is aligned (e.g., \( (1,1,-1) \), \( (1,-1,1) \), etc.).
- **1**: This is not possible for three spins, as explained below.
- **-3**: This is also not possible for three spins, as explained below.

For three spins, if two pairs are aligned, the third pair must also be aligned due to the interdependence of the spins. Thus, the possible values of \( \sum S_iS_j \) are **3** and **-1**.

### Step 3: Number of States for Each Energy
- **For \( \sum S_iS_j = 3 \):** There are 2 states where all spins are aligned: \( (1,1,1) \) and \( (-1,-1,-1) \).
- **For \( \sum S_iS_j = -1 \):** There are 6 states where exactly one pair is aligned (e.g., \( (1,1,-1) \), \( (1,-1,1) \), etc.).

### Step 4: Energy for Each Case
The energy \( E \) is related to \( \sum S_iS_j \) by \( E = -J \sum S_iS_j \):
- **For \( \sum S_iS_j = 3 \):** \( E = -3J \).
- **For \( \sum S_iS_j = -1 \):** \( E = J \).

### Step 5: Partition Function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum over all states of \( e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting the energies:
\[
Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta}.
\]

### Step 6: Matching with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — This matches.
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are incorrect.
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as both the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

### Final Answer
The correct partition function is given by **Option A**.

Answer: A
