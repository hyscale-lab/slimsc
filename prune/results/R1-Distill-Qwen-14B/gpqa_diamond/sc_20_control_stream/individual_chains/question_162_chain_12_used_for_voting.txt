Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric, right? So the space is two-dimensional, maybe like a surface?

I remember that the area of a surface can be found using the metric tensor. The area element dA is the square root of the determinant of the metric times dx dy. In this case, since it's a diagonal metric with dx² and dy² terms, the determinant should be straightforward.

The metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and similarly g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy, because g_xy and g_yx are zero. So determinant = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Then the square root of the determinant is sqrt(determinant) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Wait, but to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the entire surface. So the area A would be the integral of dA over all x and y where the metric is defined.

What's the domain of x and y here? The denominator 4 - (x² + y²) must be positive because otherwise the metric would have imaginary components. So 4 - (x² + y²) > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the surface is the region inside the circle x² + y² =4, radius 2.

Wait, but integrating over x and y up to radius 2. So switching to polar coordinates would make this easier. Let me consider x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, where r ranges from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area integral becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Because dx dy in polar is r dr dθ.

Wait, but 4 - r² is positive in this domain, so no issues. So let's compute this integral.

Let me compute the integral I = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr.

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ is 2π.

Then the r integral: ∫0 to 2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-du/2) = r dr. When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) 32 * [ (-du/2) / u ]

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to 4) (1/u) du.

Wait, because flipping the limits (from 4 to 0 to 0 to 4) removes the negative sign. So 32 * (1/2) ∫0 to4 (1/u) du = 16 ∫0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, but the integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so from 0 to 4. But as u approaches 0, ln(u) approaches -infinity. So this integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Or can it? Because if the integral is divergent, that would mean the area is infinite. But the question says "pseudosphere of radius 2." Hmm.

Wait, but let me think again. What is a pseudosphere? A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given might represent a pseudosphere. Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere is finite. Or is it?

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere is finite. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integration. Let me double-check.

The substitution:

I = ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So I = ∫ [32/(u)] * ( - du/2 ) from u=4 to u=0.

So I = 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (1/u)(-du) → 16 ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 [ln u ] from 0 to4. As u approaches 0, ln u approaches -infty. So [ln4 - (-infty)] → infty. So the integral diverges.

Wait, that means the area is infinite. But the options have D as +infty. So the answer might be D.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let's think again. What is the geometry of this metric?

The metric is ds²= (32/(4 -x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Let me check the signature. Since the denominator is positive where it's defined, the metric is (+, +) signature, so it's a positively curved space. Wait, but a pseudosphere is negatively curved.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing terms. Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents a surface with negative curvature, but the area is infinite. So the area would be infinite, leading to option D.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the question is about the area of a pseudosphere in the sense of a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, which has finite area. Wait, no, I think the pseudosphere model (like the tractricoid) actually has finite area. Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution with finite area and infinite perimeter. But that's in 3D. Hmm.

Wait, but here the metric is 2D. So if the surface is a 2D surface with metric ds² as given, then the area is the integral we computed, which diverges. So the area is infinite, which would make the answer D.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the domain of integration correct? Because when r approaches 2, 4−r² approaches zero, so the metric blows up there. So maybe the surface has a singularity at r=2, so the area is indeed infinite.

The options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty.

So the only option that makes sense is D) +infty. So the correct answer is D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To find the area of the surface, we compute the area element \(dA\), which is derived from the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is 

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element is 

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) must be positive, so the domain is the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a circle of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
A = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(1/u\) is \(\ln|u|\), so:

\[
A = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln u \to -\infty\), causing the integral to diverge to infinity. This means the total area of the surface is infinite. The metric describes a surface with a singularity at \(r = 2\), leading to an infinite area.

Among the options provided:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
