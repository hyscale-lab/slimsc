Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopic data. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking me to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, which should help in figuring out the structure.

First, I'll start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1.

DoU = (2*9 +2 - 11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 = 3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, or a combination like a ring and some double bonds. Typically, this could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 DoU) and maybe a carbonyl group (another DoU), so overall two rings? Or maybe a benzene ring plus an amide or similar.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, likely due to N-H or O-H stretching. Wait, but they're in the range of N-H stretches for amines or amides. O-H would be broader and stronger, but maybe here it's N-H. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is around where carbonyl groups (like esters, amides, ketones) show up. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's list them:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet integrating for 3H. Triplet usually indicates coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something that splits its signal into a triplet. The chemical shift is around 1.2, which is typical for a CH2CH3 group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad signals can indicate exchange with something else, like NH protons in amines or amides, but here it's 2H. It could be a -CH2- group adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe an ether group or an amine.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with three neighboring protons. Wait, no—wait, the number of peaks in splitting (like n+1) would be 4, so it's a triplet for each neighbor. Wait, no, n is the number of neighboring protons. So a quartet would be when each proton is split by 3 neighboring H's, meaning n=3. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, quartet (4 peaks) implies coupling with a group that has 3 equivalent protons. So the 2H at 4.5 are coupled with a CH2CH2 group perhaps. Like in an ethyl ester, where the OCH2CH3 is split into a quartet for the OCH2 next to CH3.

Wait, but more accurately, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 as quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So that matches. So that suggests an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each set of equivalent protons would be as a doublet. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the coupling between the two protons on each adjacent ring would give doublets. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each in the para positions. Or perhaps a single substituent with two ortho protons. Wait, actually, no. If it's a para-substituted benzene, each pair of equivalent protons would be a doublet. So maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ring to have two sets of protons: one set as a doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 8.0. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests that the proton is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or amino group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene could be something like an amide or an ester. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure-wise, that's benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the benzamide is NH-C(O)-Ph, and the ethoxy is at position 3. So the substituents on the benzene would be an OCH2CH3 and a CONH2 group. But wait, that's two substituents on the benzene, which would be in the meta positions relative to each other. But our NMR suggests para substitution, I think.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a phenyl ring with ethoxy at position 4. So the substituents would be OCH2CH3 at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1 (para to the ethoxy). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4 positions. But that would make the substituents para to each other. So in that case, the aromatic protons would be in para positions relative to substituents. So the H on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but that would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then, the ring positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each set would be a doublet. So that fits the NMR data.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph, where the amino group is at position 4. Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the ester? Or is it a carboxylic acid derivative? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see: phenyl group (C6H5), propionate (C3H5O2). So if it's ethyl propionate, but perhaps as an amide? Wait, no, the formula seems to fit. But let's think about the NMR.

In this case, the propionate ester would have an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to an oxygen, giving the triplet around 1.2 ppm. Then, the OCH2 would be around 4 ppm, as a quartet (if it's an ethyl ester). Wait, but in this option, it's a propionate ester attached to a benzamide? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the structure might be a benzamide with a propionyl group. But perhaps the NMR would have different signals.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the ring has an amino group and a carboxylic acid ester group. So the substituents are at positions 4 and 1 (if numbering so that the amino is at position 4 and the ester at position 1). Wait, 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group at position 4, and the ester group at position 1. So the substituents are para to each other.

So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each pair would be equivalent. So, the protons adjacent to the amino group (position 3 and 5) would be more deshielded, appearing around 7.0 ppm as a doublet, and the protons at 2 and 6 would be more upfield, but wait, the amino group is a strong activating group, which is ortho/para directing. So the ring protons adjacent to the amino group (positions 3 and 5) would be more downfield because of the amino's electron donating effect. Wait, but the amino group is in position 4, so the adjacent protons are 3 and 5. The substituent at position 1 is the ester (OCO-OEt). So the ester is at position 1, which is para to position 4 (the amino). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the structure para-substituted.

So for the aromatic region, the protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Let's think about their coupling. Let's say the substituents are at 1 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ester group, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the amino group. Each pair (2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the same for 3 and 5. So each set would be a doublet.

In the NMR, we have two doublets: one at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). The 8.0 ppm is more downfield, so probably the protons adjacent to the amino group (since amino is a strong activating group, but wait, amino is a strong activating, o,p-directing group. The presence of amino would make the ring protons adjacent to it more deshielded, hence higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm would be the protons ortho to the amino group, and the 7.0 ppm would be the protons meta or para to that. Wait, but in this structure, the amino is at position 4. So positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to amino. Those protons would be ortho to the amino. The positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ester group (position 1). So the protons at 3 and 5 are more deshielded, hence appear downfield at higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm is likely those two protons (each as a doublet), and the 7.0 ppm is the other two (2 and 6, each as doublets). That would fit the NMR data.

Now, looking at the NMR signals for the other groups. The ethyl ester group would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2 ppm (t,3H), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm (q,2H). Also, the amino group in D is 4-amino, which would have an NH2 group. But in the IR, the broad peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which could correspond to N-H stretching, which makes sense if the compound has an amine group.

Wait, but in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an amino group. So the IR peaks at 3420 and 3325 would be from the N-H stretch of the amine.

Looking back at the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is another peak. Hmm, what could that be? Let's think about the structure. In D, the substituents are an amino group and an ester. The amino group would be at position 4, and the ester group (OEt) at position 1. So the -NH2 would have its own protons, but in the NMR, that's not observed because it's a broad signal. Wait, but the given NMR doesn't have a peak that integrates for 2H for the amino protons. Wait, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, perhaps that's not from an NH group but from something else.

Alternatively, perhaps that 4.0 ppm is from an -OCH2- group. Wait, but in an ester, the OCH2 would be at 4.5 ppm as a quartet. Oh wait, but in option D, the ester is OEt (OCH2CH3). So the OCH2 would be at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. However, the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H, and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an NH group. But the options vary. Let me look at each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. The ethoxy is at position 3. The substituents on the ring are CONH2 at position 1 (if we number for para), and OCH2CH3 at position 3. Wait, but that's meta substitution. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Are those equivalent? Maybe not, so they might show more complex splitting. But our NMR shows two doublets, implying two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps this option is less likely.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a phenyl ring with an ethoxy group at position 4. So the substituents are HCONR2 at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 4. So substituents are para to each other. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the other protons at 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 as well. So each group would be a doublet. So the aromatic region matches. Now, looking at the NMR, the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks are 2H each. The formamide group (HCONH-) would have a carbonyl and an NH group. The NH would give a broad peak, perhaps in the NMR, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm.

Wait, the formamide would have NH2 protons. But in the NMR, the broad peak is at 4.0 ppm, which might not align. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is OCH2CH3, giving the triplet at 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 in the ethoxy would be around 4.0 as a quartet. Wait, but in the NMR data, ethoxy's OCH2 would be at 4.0, but in the data, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from something else.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4-NH2. Wait, no. Let me clarify: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester attached to the 4-aminophenyl group. So the structure is NH2-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So, it's O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the phenyl at position 4, and the amino at position 4 as well? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's (4-aminophenyl) propionate, which would be the propionate ester attached to the benzene ring, with the amino group at position 4. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, that would be a propionyl group attached as an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the amino is attached to the benzene, and the propionate is another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's benzamide with a propionyl group. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the NMR. The 1.20 ppm triplet is likely the CH2CH3 of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen. So that's the ethyl ester group. The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. But in option C, the ester is propionate, which is CH2CH2COO-. So the OCH2 would be part of a longer chain. The quartet at 4.5 would correspond to a -O-CH2-CH2- group, but I'm not sure. Maybe the 4.5 quartet is from an ethyl ester, which would suggest that it's option D or B.

Wait, let's think about the 4.0 ppm peak, which is a broad singlet for 2H. In option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the structure has an amino group (-NH2). The amino group's protons are usually broad and can appear as a singlet, but they would be integrating for 2H. So if the amino group is at position 4, the -NH2 protons would give a broad peak. But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that would fit, because the amino protons are typically around 1.5-5 ppm, depending on the environment. But wait, in the IR, there are strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are likely N-H stretches. That fits with an amine.

In option D, the substituents are an amino group and an ester group. So the amino group would have two protons, which would show up as a broad peak. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that fits. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is from OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 ppm is from the CH3 of the ethyl ester.

So, putting it all together:

- The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is the ethyl CH3.
- The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.
- The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is the NH2 group (but wait, in the structure, it's a primary amino group, so two protons. But in the NMR, the amino protons are usually broad, but would they appear as a singlet? Or are they split? In primary amines, the two H's are equivalent and the splitting is usually negligible, so they appear as a singlet. But sometimes, they can be broad due to exchange, so that fits.

So, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 (d,2H) and 8.0 (d,2H), which matches the para substitution with substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Looking at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. In option D, that's the ester carbonyl (COO) which typically absorbs around 1720 cm-1.

So putting all this together, option D seems to fit. But wait, let me check the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would have a formamide group (HCONH-) attached to the benzene which also has an ethoxy group at position 4. The formamide's carbonyl would show up in IR at 1720 cm-1. The ethoxy's OCH2CH3 would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0-4.3. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual for an ethoxy OCH2. So maybe that's not a perfect fit.

Option D's ethyl ester would have OCH2 at ~4.1-4.3, but in the data, it's at 4.5. Hmm, but perhaps it's due to the neighboring groups. The ester's OCH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, so could deshield it, shifting it upfield or downfield. Wait, no, adjacent to the carbonyl would cause deshielding, leading to higher ppm—so 4.5 ppm is possible.

Wait, another point: the IR shows two strong N-H stretches. Option D has an amino group, which has two N-H protons. So they would produce two peaks in the IR around 3400 cm-1, which matches the data.

In option B, the formamide has an NH group. The formamide's NH would have a peak in IR around 3300-3500 cm-1, but the IR data here doesn't have a peak that high except for 3420 and 3325. However, in the data, the 3420 and 3325 are both present, which could correspond to two different N-H groups. So maybe in option D, the amino group has two N-Hs, giving two peaks in IR. So that fits.

Now, let's look at the NMR of option D. The ethyl ester would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, OCH2 as quartet at 4.5, and the NH2 as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic signals match as discussed.

So, the correct option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, with IR and 1H NMR data provided. The molecular formula gives a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 3, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (3 DoU) and a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, consistent with N-H stretching, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), and two doublets in the aromatic region at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H).

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This structure has a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) at the meta position. The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets, as the substituents are not para to each other. Additionally, the NMR data does not match the expected splitting patterns for this structure.  

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This structure has a formamide group (HCONH-) and an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) at the para position. The aromatic protons would produce two doublets, consistent with the NMR data. However, the ethoxy group's OCH2 signal would typically appear as a quartet around 4.1–4.3 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm as observed. Additionally, the IR data does not strongly support a formamide structure.  

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This structure has an amino group (-NH2) and a propionate ester group (CH2CH2COO-) at the para position. The NMR data does not match the expected splitting patterns for this structure, as the propionate ester would produce different signals for the OCH2 groups.  

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This structure has an amino group (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3) at the para position. The aromatic protons produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with the para substitution pattern. The ethyl ester group explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm matches the NH2 protons of the amino group. The IR data aligns with the presence of an amino group (N-H stretches) and a carbonyl group (ester).  

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data and molecular formula are most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopic data. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking me to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, which should help in figuring out the structure.

First, I'll start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1.

DoU = (2*9 +2 - 11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 = 3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, or a combination like a ring and some double bonds. Typically, this could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 DoU) and maybe a carbonyl group (another DoU), so overall two rings? Or maybe a benzene ring plus an amide or similar.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, likely due to N-H or O-H stretching. Wait, but they're in the range of N-H stretches for amines or amides. O-H would be broader and stronger, but maybe here it's N-H. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is around where carbonyl groups (like esters, amides, ketones) show up. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's list them:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet integrating for 3H. Triplet usually indicates coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something that splits its signal into a triplet. The chemical shift is around 1.2, which is typical for a CH2CH3 group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad signals can indicate exchange with something else, like NH protons in amines or amides, but here it's 2H. It could be a -CH2- group adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe an ether group or an amine.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with three neighboring protons. Wait, no—wait, the number of peaks in splitting (like n+1) would be 4, so it's a triplet for each neighbor. Wait, no, n is the number of neighboring protons. So a quartet would be when each proton is split by 3 neighboring H's, meaning n=3. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, quartet (4 peaks) implies coupling with a group that has 3 equivalent protons. So the 2H at 4.5 are coupled with a CH2CH2 group perhaps. Like in an ethyl ester, where the OCH2CH3 is split into a quartet for the OCH2 next to CH3.

Wait, but more accurately, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 as quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So that matches. So that suggests an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each set of equivalent protons would be as a doublet. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the coupling between the two protons on each adjacent ring would give doublets. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each in the para positions. Or perhaps a single substituent with two ortho protons. Wait, actually, no. If it's a para-substituted benzene, each pair of equivalent protons would be a doublet. So maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ring to have two sets of protons: one set as a doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 8.0. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests that the proton is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or amino group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene could be something like an amide or an ester. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure-wise, that's benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the benzamide is NH-C(O)-Ph, and the ethoxy is at position 3. So the substituents on the benzene would be an OCH2CH3 and a CONH2 group. But wait, that's two substituents on the benzene, which would be in the meta positions relative to each other. But our NMR suggests para substitution, I think.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a phenyl ring with ethoxy at position 4. So the substituents would be OCH2CH3 at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1 (para to the ethoxy). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4 positions. But that would make the substituents para to each other. So in that case, the aromatic protons would be in para positions relative to substituents. So the H on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but that would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then, the ring positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each set would be a doublet. So that fits the NMR data.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph, where the amino group is at position 4. Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the ester? Or is it a carboxylic acid derivative? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see: phenyl group (C6H5), propionate (C3H5O2). So if it's ethyl propionate, but perhaps as an amide? Wait, no, the formula seems to fit. But let's think about the NMR.

In this case, the propionate ester would have an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to an oxygen, giving the triplet around 1.2 ppm. Then, the OCH2 would be around 4 ppm, as a quartet (if it's an ethyl ester). Wait, but in this option, it's a propionate ester attached to a benzamide? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the structure might be a benzamide with a propionyl group. But perhaps the NMR would have different signals.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the ring has an amino group and a carboxylic acid ester group. So the substituents are at positions 4 and 1 (if numbering so that the amino is at position 4 and the ester at position 1). Wait, 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group at position 4, and the ester group at position 1. So the substituents are para to each other.

So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each pair would be equivalent. So, the protons adjacent to the amino group (position 3 and 5) would be more deshielded, appearing around 7.0 ppm as a doublet, and the protons at 2 and 6 would be more upfield, but wait, the amino group is a strong activating group, which is ortho/para directing. So the ring protons adjacent to the amino group (positions 3 and 5) would be more downfield because of the amino's electron donating effect. Wait, but the amino group is in position 4, so the adjacent protons are 3 and 5. The substituent at position 1 is the ester (OCO-OEt). So the ester is at position 1, which is para to position 4 (the amino). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the structure para-substituted.

So for the aromatic region, the protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Let's think about their coupling. Let's say the substituents are at 1 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ester group, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the amino group. Each pair (2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the same for 3 and 5. So each set would be a doublet.

In the NMR, we have two doublets: one at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). The 8.0 ppm is more downfield, so probably the protons adjacent to the amino group (since amino is a strong activating group, but wait, amino is a strong activating, o,p-directing group. The presence of amino would make the ring protons adjacent to it more deshielded, hence higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm would be the protons ortho to the amino group, and the 7.0 ppm would be the protons meta or para to that. Wait, but in this structure, the amino is at position 4. So positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to amino. Those protons would be ortho to the amino. The positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ester group (position 1). So the protons at 3 and 5 are more deshielded, hence appear downfield at higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm is likely those two protons (each as a doublet), and the 7.0 ppm is the other two (2 and 6, each as doublets). That would fit the NMR data.

Now, looking at the NMR signals for the other groups. The ethyl ester group would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2 ppm (t,3H), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm (q,2H). Also, the amino group in D is 4-amino, which would have an NH2 group. But in the IR, the broad peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which could correspond to N-H stretching, which makes sense if the compound has an amine group.

Wait, but in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an amino group. So the IR peaks at 3420 and 3325 would be from the N-H stretch of the amine.

Looking back at the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is another peak. Hmm, what could that be? Let's think about the structure. In D, the substituents are an amino group and an ester. The amino group would be at position 4, and the ester group (OEt) at position 1. So the -NH2 would have its own protons, but in the NMR, that's not observed because it's a broad signal. Wait, but the given NMR doesn't have a peak that integrates for 2H for the amino protons. Wait, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, perhaps that's not from an NH group but from something else.

Alternatively, perhaps that 4.0 ppm is from an -OCH2- group. Wait, but in an ester, the OCH2 would be at 4.5 ppm as a quartet. Oh wait, but in option D, the ester is OEt (OCH2CH3). So the OCH2 would be at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. However, the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H, and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an NH group. But the options vary. Let me look at each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. The ethoxy is at position 3. The substituents on the ring are CONH2 at position 1 (if we number for para), and OCH2CH3 at position 3. Wait, but that's meta substitution. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Are those equivalent? Maybe not, so they might show more complex splitting. But our NMR shows two doublets, implying two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps this option is less likely.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a phenyl ring with an ethoxy group at position 4. So the substituents are HCONR2 at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 4. So substituents are para to each other. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the other protons at 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 as well. So each group would be a doublet. So the aromatic region matches. Now, looking at the NMR, the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks are 2H each. The formamide group (HCONH-) would have a carbonyl and an NH group. The NH would give a broad peak, perhaps in the NMR, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm.

Wait, the formamide would have NH2 protons. But in the NMR, the broad peak is at 4.0 ppm, which might not align. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is OCH2CH3, giving the triplet at 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 in the ethoxy would be around 4.0 as a quartet. Wait, but in the NMR data, ethoxy's OCH2 would be at 4.0, but in the data, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from something else.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4-NH2. Wait, no. Let me clarify: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester attached to the 4-aminophenyl group. So the structure is NH2-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So, it's O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the phenyl at position 4, and the amino at position 4 as well? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's (4-aminophenyl) propionate, which would be the propionate ester attached to the benzene ring, with the amino group at position 4. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, that would be a propionyl group attached as an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the amino is attached to the benzene, and the propionate is another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's benzamide with a propionyl group. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the NMR. The 1.20 ppm triplet is likely the CH2CH3 of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen. So that's the ethyl ester group. The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. But in option C, the ester is propionate, which is CH2CH2COO-. So the OCH2 would be part of a longer chain. The quartet at 4.5 would correspond to a -O-CH2-CH2- group, but I'm not sure. Maybe the 4.5 quartet is from an ethyl ester, which would suggest that it's option D or B.

Wait, let's think about the 4.0 ppm peak, which is a broad singlet for 2H. In option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the structure has an amino group (-NH2). The amino group's protons are usually broad and can appear as a singlet, but they would be integrating for 2H. So if the amino group is at position 4, the -NH2 protons would give a broad peak. But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that would fit, because the amino protons are typically around 1.5-5 ppm, depending on the environment. But wait, in the IR, there are strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are likely N-H stretches. That fits with an amine.

In option D, the substituents are an amino group and an ester group. So the amino group would have two protons, which would show up as a broad peak. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that fits. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is from OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 ppm is from the CH3 of the ethyl ester.

So, putting it all together:

- The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is the ethyl CH3.
- The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.
- The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is the NH2 group (but wait, in the structure, it's a primary amino group, so two protons. But in the NMR, the amino protons are usually broad, but would they appear as a singlet? Or are they split? In primary amines, the two H's are equivalent and the splitting is usually negligible, so they appear as a singlet. But sometimes, they can be broad due to exchange, so that fits.

So, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 (d,2H) and 8.0 (d,2H), which matches the para substitution with substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Looking at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. In option D, that's the ester carbonyl (COO) which typically absorbs around 1720 cm-1.

So putting all this together, option D seems to fit. But wait, let me check the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would have a formamide group (HCONH-) attached to the benzene which also has an ethoxy group at position 4. The formamide's carbonyl would show up in IR at 1720 cm-1. The ethoxy's OCH2CH3 would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0-4.3. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual for an ethoxy OCH2. So maybe that's not a perfect fit.

Option D's ethyl ester would have OCH2 at ~4.1-4.3, but in the data, it's at 4.5. Hmm, but perhaps it's due to the neighboring groups. The ester's OCH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, so could deshield it, shifting it upfield or downfield. Wait, no, adjacent to the carbonyl would cause deshielding, leading to higher ppm—so 4.5 ppm is possible.

Wait, another point: the IR shows two strong N-H stretches. Option D has an amino group, which has two N-H protons. So they would produce two peaks in the IR around 3400 cm-1, which matches the data.

In option B, the formamide has an NH group. The formamide's NH would have a peak in IR around 3300-3500 cm-1, but the IR data here doesn't have a peak that high except for 3420 and 3325. However, in the data, the 3420 and 3325 are both present, which could correspond to two different N-H groups. So maybe in option D, the amino group has two N-Hs, giving two peaks in IR. So that fits.

Now, let's look at the NMR of option D. The ethyl ester would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, OCH2 as quartet at 4.5, and the NH2 as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic signals match as discussed.

So, the correct option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, with IR and 1H NMR data provided. The molecular formula gives a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 3, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (3 DoU) and a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, consistent with N-H stretching, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), and two doublets in the aromatic region at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H).

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This structure has a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) at the meta position. The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets, as the substituents are not para to each other. Additionally, the NMR data does not match the expected splitting patterns for this structure.  

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This structure has a formamide group (HCONH-) and an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) at the para position. The aromatic protons would produce two doublets, consistent with the NMR data. However, the ethoxy group's OCH2 signal would typically appear as a quartet around 4.1–4.3 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm as observed. Additionally, the IR data does not strongly support a formamide structure.  

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This structure has an amino group (-NH2) and a propionate ester group (CH2CH2COO-) at the para position. The NMR data does not match the expected splitting patterns for this structure, as the propionate ester would produce different signals for the OCH2 groups.  

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This structure has an amino group (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3) at the para position. The aromatic protons produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with the para substitution pattern. The ethyl ester group explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm matches the NH2 protons of the amino group. The IR data aligns with the presence of an amino group (N-H stretches) and a carbonyl group (ester).  

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data and molecular formula are most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
