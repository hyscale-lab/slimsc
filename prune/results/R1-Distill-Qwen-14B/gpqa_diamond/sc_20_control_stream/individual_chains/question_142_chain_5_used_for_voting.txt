Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Let me think about what that represents. Oh, right! This is the density matrix for a completely mixed state. Because when you have equal probabilities for both states |0⟩ and |1⟩, it's like a classical mixture, not a pure quantum state.

So, I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 2D space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), where the state |0⟩ is at (1,0,0), and |1⟩ is at (-1,0,0), but wait, actually, no. Wait, correction: the Bloch sphere uses the state |+x⟩ as (1,0,0) and |−x⟩ as (−1,0,0), but for |0⟩ and |1⟩, it's a bit different. Oh right, |0⟩ is (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is (-1,0,0) in the Bloch sphere representation. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, in the Bloch sphere, |0⟩ is at (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is at (-1,0,0). Wait, no, that can't be right because the density matrix for a pure state |0⟩ is |0⟩⟨0|, which would have the vector (1,0,0), but when you have a mixed state like this, it's the completely mixed state which is in the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, okay, the density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For |0⟩, that's a pure state at (1,0,0). For a completely mixed state, like equal probabilities of |0⟩ and |1⟩, the density matrix is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal. I think the density matrix for the completely mixed state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )/2, which is exactly what's given here.

So, how does this translate to the Bloch sphere? The density matrix can be represented by a vector in the Bloch sphere, right? The formula is something like: the density matrix can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me write that down. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, where r_x, r_y, r_z are the components of the Bloch vector r. So, since the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, let me compute that.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2, right? Because (I)/2 would be [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], which is exactly what we have here.

So, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So r must be (0,0,0). Because all components of r are zero.

That makes sense because the completely mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to r=(0,0,0). So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.

Let me double-check. The density matrix for the completely mixed state is indeed the maximally mixed state, so it's at the origin. So yes, the position is (0,0,0).

The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given density matrix, \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin of the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the completely mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
