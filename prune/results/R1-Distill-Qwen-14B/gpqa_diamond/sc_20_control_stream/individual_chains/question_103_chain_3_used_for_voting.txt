Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize what's going on. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5: a bromine at 3 and a nitro group at 5. And connected to the benzene is a ketone group (ethan-1-one), which means a carbonyl attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait a second. Ethan-1-one is (CH2)COCH3? No, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene with a ketone group (like acetophenone) but the benzene has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So, the ketone is at position 1, and then bromine is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. Or wait, numbering in aromatic compounds is a bit tricky. Let me think. Benzene is a ring, so the substituents are at positions ortho, meta, para relative to each other. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is meta to it, and position 5 would be para to position 3 and meta to position 1. Hmm, maybe I should draw the benzene ring and number it.

Imagine the benzene ring with the ketone group in the first position (let's say top). Then, position 3 is the next clockwise, and position 5 is the one after that. So, substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is attached to position 1, bromine at position 3 (which is two carbons away), and nitro at position 5 (which is opposite to position 1, so para to position 3? Maybe I'm getting that wrong, but perhaps it's better to think of the substituents in terms of their positions relative to each other.

Now, the challenge is to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to add these substituents in the right order and positions.

I remember that when you substitute benzene, the directing effects of substituents matter. For example, nitration is a meta-directing group, and bromination with FeBr3 is a meta director. However, the ketone group (like acetophenone) is an activating group because it's a ketone attached via a single bond, wait no. Wait, no, ketones attached to benzene are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, more accurately, the ketone is a meta-directing group because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group via resonance, but it's still ortho/para-directing because it's attached via a sigma bond? Or is it meta-directing? Wait, no, acetophenone (a ketone) is a meta-directing group because the carbonyl is deactivating and meta-directing. So when you have a ketone attached to benzene, any new substituent will enter at the meta position relative to the ketone.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The directing effect depends on the substituent. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing. Nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing. Halogens are deactivating but ortho/para-directing because of their resonance effects.

Wait, the ketone group (like in acetophenone) is a meta-directing group because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group. So, when you have a benzene ring with a ketone substituent, any new substituent will go into the meta position relative to the ketone.

So, to have substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone (which is at position 1), perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are added in the correct order such that each new substituent is directed to the right position.

But wait, the target molecule has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So, the ketone is at position 1, and the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, if the ketone is at 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5? No, wait. Each substituent has its own directing effect.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents matters. Let's say first, you introduce a nitro group, then a ketone, then bromine? Or another order.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps.

The target molecule has:

- A ketone group attached to the benzene ring.

- Bromine at position 3 relative to the ketone.

- Nitro group at position 5 relative to the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that they are at ortho and para positions relative to each other, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are in the meta positions relative to each other, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the substituents' positions relative to each other on the benzene ring. The ketone is attached at a certain point, and then the bromine and nitro groups are added in the correct positions.

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the nitro group.

2. Introduce the bromine.

3. Then introduce the ketone.

But wait, that can't be because the ketone is a substituent that needs to be added via Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be done on benzene rings that are deactivated. So, if we already have a nitro group, which is deactivating, then performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group to direct the acylation. So, if the ring is already deactivated, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced first, and then the other substituents are added.

So, the first step could be Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce the ketone. Then, with the ketone as a meta-directing group, we can add bromine in the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, perhaps add the nitro group in the meta position relative to the ketone, but wait, that would be the same as the bromine's position. Hmm, no. Wait, maybe the nitro group is added in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is para to the ketone. No, wait, the ketone is meta-directing, so any substituent would go into the meta position relative to the ketone. But if you add a nitro group after the bromine, perhaps it would go into a different meta position.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are added in such a way that they're in the correct positions without conflicting.

Wait, maybe the order is: first add the nitro group, then bromine, then the ketone. But again, the ketone requires an activating group, and the nitro group is deactivating, so that would prevent the ketone from being added. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after the ketone, which is meta to it, and then the nitro group is added in another position.

Wait, let me think again. Let's list the substituents:

- Ketone (meta-directing, deactivating).

- Bromine (deactivating, ortho/para-directing).

- Nitro group (meta-directing, deactivating).

Hmm.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5.

So, the nitro and bromine are at positions 3 and 5, which are both meta to each other and to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the nitro and bromine are both meta to the ketone. So, when the ketone is attached, the next substituents are added in the meta positions.

But how to get both substituents there.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent is the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone.

But again, after introducing the nitro group, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then the bromine, then the nitro group.

But let's think about the steps.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with CH3COCl and AlCl3. This would give acetophenone, which has the ketone group attached.

Then, step 2: bromination. Bromine with FeBr3 as a catalyst. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the bromine would add at the meta position relative to the ketone. So, in acetophenone, adding Br would give 3-bromoacetophenone.

Step 3: Now, we need to add the nitro group. But where? Using nitration (HNO3 with H2SO4). Since the acetophenone is meta-directing, and the bromine is already at the meta position, where will the nitro group go? Well, the nitration will be directed by the substituents already present. The ring has two substituents: the ketone and the bromine.

The ketone is meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para-directing (since it's a deactivating but ortho/para director). So, the nitro group could be added in a position that's a meta position to the ketone (which is already at position 1), or ortho or para to the bromine.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when you add nitro, after acetophenone and bromine, where will it go?

Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let's think.

Step 1: Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, nitro is a meta director and deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So, you can't do Friedel-Crafts on nitrobenzene because the ring is deactivating. So that would be impossible.

So, the ketone must be introduced before any deactivating groups, because once you have deactivating groups, the ring becomes less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

So, the ketone must be added first, followed by the deactivating substituents.

So, the steps must be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the ketone.

2. Bromination, which goes meta to the ketone.

3. Nitration, which perhaps goes ortho or para to the bromine, but let's check.

Wait, after adding the ketone (position 1) and bromine (position 3), the ring has two substituents. Now, when nitrating, the nitro group can be directed by either the ketone or the bromine.

The ketone is meta-directing, and the bromine is ortho/para-directing. But which one is more influential? The substituent that is more strongly activating or deactivating?

Wait, both are deactivating. So, the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than bromine. So, the nitration will be influenced more by the substituent with the stronger directing effect.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine, being closer, has a stronger influence. Let me think.

In such cases, the nitration would likely occur at positions that are either ortho or para to the bromine, but meta to the ketone. Wait, the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3. The positions available are 2,4,5,6.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1) and para to the bromine (position 3).

Wait, if the ketone is at 1, bromine at 3, then position 5 is meta to 1. So, when nitrating, the nitro group would add at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine.

So, the order would be:

1. Acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Bromination: adds at position 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Nitration: adds at position 5 (meta to ketone, para to Br).

So, the sequence would be: acylation, bromination, nitration.

But looking at the options, which option follows this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation) → ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination) → iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration).

That's acylation first, then bromine, then nitration. That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me look at the other steps in option A. After nitration, it has more steps: iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, but after nitration, why would you need more steps? That seems like more reactions, which might not be necessary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the nitration has to be done in a specific order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before bromine.

Wait, but I thought that after nitro, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, I'm confused.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the bromine is introduced after the nitro group. But that would require adding nitro first, then bromine, then ketone. But that can't work because the ketone requires an activating group.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to consider the substituent's directing effects and the order in which they are added.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: ketone at 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5.

So, perhaps the nitro and bromine are both meta to the ketone.

But how to get them both in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added first, then the nitro group, then the ketone. But no, because the ketone can't be added if the ring is deactivated by nitro or bromine (since both are deactivating).

So, the ketone must be added first, then the other substituents.

So, the correct sequence would be:

1. Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) → acetophenone.

2. Bromination → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitration → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

So, the reaction steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) AcCl, ii) Br2, iii) HNO3. Then, more steps.

Wait, but after nitration, why are there more steps? Because the target only has those three substituents. So, perhaps the options include more steps, but perhaps some steps are unnecessary or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Each option lists seven steps. That seems a lot. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, it's a benzene ring with three substituents: ketone, bromine, nitro. So, all three must be present.

Wait, but I thought the steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration, totaling three steps. But the options have seven steps each, so perhaps each option includes other steps.

Wait, perhaps some steps are for protection or functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs before the bromination.

Wait, let me think again: if I first nitrate the benzene, then acylate, then brominate.

But nitro is deactivating, so acylation won't occur after nitration. So that's not possible.

Thus, the acylation must be first. So, the correct steps are acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: i) AcCl → ii) Br → iii) HNO3. Then steps iv to vii: Fe/HCl, HNO3, NaNO2, H3PO2.

Wait, why after nitration are there more steps? That would imply more reactions, but the target is achieved after step iii. So, perhaps the other steps are not needed or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done in a different position. Maybe after acylation and bromination, the nitration needs to be directed in a certain way, requiring some other reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are introduced via different methods, such as using a directing group.

Another thought: sometimes, when you have multiple substituents, the directing can be influenced by the strongest director. So, in the case of acetophenone (meta-directing) and bromine (ortho/para), which will dominate?

In the case of acetophenone and bromine, the bromine is a stronger activating group? No, wait, bromine is deactivating but ortho/para. Acetophenone is deactivating and meta.

So, when both are present, the nitration may occur where? It depends on which substituent is more influential. I think that the nitration would be directed by the more activating group, but since both are deactivating, it's the position that is most favored by their directing effects.

Wait, in acetophenone, the meta position is activated. But with Br at position 3, which is ortho/para. So, perhaps the nitro group would go into a position ortho or para to the Br, but meta to the ketone.

Wait, if the ketone is at 1, bromine at 3, then the possible positions for nitro are 2 (ortho to Br, meta to ketone?), 4 (para to Br, which is position 3's para is 6?), wait, no.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 3's para would be position 6? Because 1 is the first, 2,3,4,5,6 going around. So, position 3's para is 6, but the ketone is at 1. So, when adding nitro, where would it go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group adds meta to the ketone, which is position 5.

So, in that case, the nitration would be done after bromination, and the nitro would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine?

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, the steps are acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back at the options, option A seems to have these three steps as the first three steps (i, ii, iii). Then, why does it have more steps after?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done before bromination. Let's think.

If I first nitrate the benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Then, I can't acylate because nitro is deactivating. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after the nitro group, but that would require the ring to be activated enough for Friedel-Crafts, which it isn't.

So, back to option A: the steps after iii are iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3; vi) NaNO2; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, Fe/HCl is probably for reducing something, like reducing nitro groups to amine? But the target has a nitro group, so we don't want to reduce it. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl is often used for diazotization, which is used in Sandmeyer reactions to introduce halogens. H3PO2 is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to reduce ketones to methylene groups. But in the target molecule, we have a ketone, so that would not be desirable. So, perhaps those steps would remove the ketone, which is not desired.

Hmm, so option A seems to have steps that would remove the ketone, which is not the case. So, perhaps option A is not the correct sequence.

Looking at option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3; iii) CH3COCl; iv) HNO3; etc.

Wait, that's adding bromine first, which would give bromobenzene. Then nitration of bromobenzene would add nitro group, maybe at para position because bromine is ortho/para directing. Then, acylation.

But wait, can you acylate bromobenzene? Because bromine is a deactivating group, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts acylation might not proceed. So, step iii (CH3COCl) might not work. So, option B is likely incorrect.

Option C: i) HNO3; then Fe/HCl; then CH3COCl.

But as before, nitration first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult. So, option C is probably not correct.

Option D: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2; vi) CH3COCl; vii) HNO3.

This seems complicated. Starting with nitration, then steps that would reduce or modify substituents, then bromination and acylation, then another nitration. That seems unlikely to give the correct product, especially with multiple nitration steps.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct sequence is option A, but the steps after iii are confusing. Alternatively, I might have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, another approach: think about which options have the acylation as the first step.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) AcCl → yes.

Option B: i) Br → no.

Option C: i) HNO3 → no.

Option D: i) HNO3 → no.

So, only option A has the acylation as the first step.

But, why does option A have more steps?

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and the rest of the steps are not needed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii is not the correct position. Maybe the nitration needs to happen after some other step.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes, when you have two meta directors, the substituents can end up in the correct positions. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done before the bromine is added, but that would require having the ring activated.

Wait, but I already thought that the ketone must be added first.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, would that work?

Acylation gives acetophenone. Nitration would add nitro group meta to the ketone, at position 5. Then bromination would add at position 3, meta to the ketone and para to the nitro group.

So, the steps would be:

1. AcCl → acetophenone.

2. HNO3 → 5-nitroacetophenone.

3. Br2 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which is the desired product.

So, the sequence is i, iii, ii. Looking at the options, does any option do that?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii. So, acylation, bromination, nitration. That's not the same as acylation, nitration, bromination.

So, perhaps another option follows that order.

Looking at the options:

Option B: i) Br; ii) HNO3; iii) AcCl.

No, that's acylation as third step.

Option C: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) AcCl.

No, acylation is third.

Option D: i) HNO3; then other steps, then Br and AcCl.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options have the correct order except option A. But option A's steps after iii don't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target molecule again. The correct substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the nitration comes before the bromination. So, if the nitro group is added before the bromine, where would it go?

After acylation (position 1), if I nitrate, the nitro goes to position 5. Then bromination would go to position 3.

That would give the correct product.

So, the steps are:

i) AcCl → acetophenone.

ii) HNO3 → 5-nitroacetophenone.

iii) Br2 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which is the desired product.

Looking at the options, which option does acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking at the options, option A has steps i, ii, iii as AcCl, Br2, HNO3. So, that's acylate, brominate, then nitrate. Which leads to the bromine at 3, then nitration would be directed by the bromine and ketone.

Wait, but in that case, after AcCl and Br2, the ring has Ac and Br. Then, during nitration, where would the nitro group add?

As before, the ring has Ac at 1, Br at 3.

During nitration, the nitro group would add where? It's influenced by both substituents. The Ac is meta-directing, and Br is ortho/para-directing.

The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

If the Ac is at 1, Br at 3. So, the nitro group can be added at position 5 (meta to Ac and para to Br). Because position 5 is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine, which is possible.

So, if the sequence is Ac, Br, then nitrate, the nitro would end up at 5. That would give the correct product.

So, option A would have steps i, ii, iii as AcCl, Br2, HNO3, which would produce the desired product. Then, why are there more steps in option A?

Because the target is achieved after step iii, the remaining steps (iv to vii) must be incorrect or perhaps leading to side reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the product requires some workup steps, but in the given options, the steps after iii in option A are not needed for the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence requires more steps, but the correct order is in option A.

Wait, but looking at option A's steps:

i) AcCl → acetophenone.

ii) Br2 → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

So, after step iii, the target is achieved. The steps iv to vii probably do something else, which might be incorrect, but perhaps the question is only considering the necessary steps, so the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but then why are steps iv to vii present? Because they're part of the sequence. So, perhaps the correct option is not A, because the steps after iii would alter the product.

Looking at option A's steps iv to vii:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce something, maybe the nitro group? But that would give an amine, which is not desired.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration step? That would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, maybe to make a diazonium salt.

vii) H3PO2 → Wolff-Kishner, which would reduce the ketone to a methylene group, converting ethanone to ethane. Which would destroy the ketone, which is not desired.

So, option A includes steps that would actually degrade the desired product, which can't be correct. Therefore, option A cannot be the correct sequence.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Are steps iv to vii part of the same synthesis, but not all necessary?

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps are not part of the necessary sequence but are included as distractors.

But the question states that the sequence should lead to the high-yield synthesis of the target. So, unnecessary steps that could degrade the product would make option A incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is not option A.

Looking again, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination. So, let's see which option does that.

Looking at the options, does any option have i) AcCl, then iii) HNO3, then ii) Br2?

Looking at the options, option B has i) Br2, then ii) HNO3, then iii) AcCl. No.

Option C: i) HNO3, then iii) AcCl. No.

Option D: i) HNO3, then steps, then Br2, then AcCl. No.

Hmm. So, perhaps none of the options have the correct order, but since the options are given, I must choose the best possible option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the nitration is done after bromination, but in a different position.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after acylation and bromination, the nitration occurs in a different position.

Wait, during bromination, the ring has Ac at 1 and Br at 3. During nitration, the nitro group adds at position 5, which is meta to Ac and para to Br.

Thus, the correct product is formed. So, the steps in option A's first three steps would yield the correct product.

But then, why are the other steps present in option A? That seems like a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the target isn't achieved until all seven steps are done, but that seems unlikely.

But the target molecule doesn't require any steps beyond the third, so the other steps would be extra.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps in the option are correct, and the other steps aren't necessary, but the question requires selecting the sequence that leads to the target, regardless of extra steps.

But that seems unlikely; the other steps would change the product.

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, then nitration, which is option A's steps i, ii, iii. Then, the other steps are not relevant or perhaps a mistake.

But looking again, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ethan-1-one. So, after the first three steps of option A, we have that. So, perhaps the other steps in option A are not part of the required synthesis but are distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the correct sequence is the first three steps, and the rest are not part of the correct pathway.

But since the options list all seven steps, I must consider all.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the nitration step. Maybe the nitration in option A is not at the correct position.

Wait, after acylation and bromination, the ring has Ac at 1 and Br at 3.

Nitration would then add nitro group at position 5, which is meta to Ac and para to Br.

So, that's correct.

Thus, the first three steps of option A yield the desired product. The other steps (iv to vii) are perhaps not part of the required synthesis. So, perhaps the correct option is A, but the rest of the steps are distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, option D's steps: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2; vi) AcCl; vii) HNO3.

That seems like an incorrect sequence, as it starts with nitration, which would prevent acylation.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I have to choose the best possible.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the directing effects. Let me recheck.

If the ketone is at 1, and the bromine is at 3 (meta), then during nitration, the nitro group would go to position 5 (meta to ketone and para to bromine), which is correct.

Thus, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back, only option A has this as the first three steps.

So, despite the extra steps, option A's steps i, ii, iii are correct. Thus, the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone group first, followed by bromination and nitration in the appropriate positions. The ketone group is meta-directing and deactivating, so it must be introduced early to allow subsequent reactions to proceed. Bromination and nitration must then occur in the correct positions relative to the ketone.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → introduces the ketone at position 1.  
     ii) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) → adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
     iii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → adds nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to the bromine).  
   - After step iii, the target molecule is formed. The additional steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary and potentially destructive (e.g., reducing the ketone or adding extra nitro groups). However, the first three steps are correct.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) → introduces bromine.  
     ii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → adds nitro group.  
     iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → attempts to introduce the ketone.  
   - Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration because nitro is a strong deactivator. This sequence is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → introduces nitro group.  
     ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
     iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → attempts to introduce the ketone.  
   - Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration because nitro is a strong deactivator. This sequence is incorrect.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → introduces nitro group.  
     ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
     iii) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → forms a diazonium salt.  
     iv) Wolff-Kishner reduction (H₃PO₂) → reduces the ketone to a methylene group.  
     v) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) → adds bromine.  
     vi) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → attempts to introduce the ketone.  
     vii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → adds another nitro group.  
   - This sequence starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation. Additionally, the Wolff-Kishner reduction destroys the ketone. This sequence is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only sequence that correctly introduces the ketone first, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct positions, is **Option A**. Despite the inclusion of unnecessary steps after the third, the first three steps are correct and lead to the desired product.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize what's going on. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5: a bromine at 3 and a nitro group at 5. And connected to the benzene is a ketone group (ethan-1-one), which means a carbonyl attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait a second. Ethan-1-one is (CH2)COCH3? No, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene with a ketone group (like acetophenone) but the benzene has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So, the ketone is at position 1, and then bromine is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. Or wait, numbering in aromatic compounds is a bit tricky. Let me think. Benzene is a ring, so the substituents are at positions ortho, meta, para relative to each other. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is meta to it, and position 5 would be para to position 3 and meta to position 1. Hmm, maybe I should draw the benzene ring and number it.

Imagine the benzene ring with the ketone group in the first position (let's say top). Then, position 3 is the next clockwise, and position 5 is the one after that. So, substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is attached to position 1, bromine at position 3 (which is two carbons away), and nitro at position 5 (which is opposite to position 1, so para to position 3? Maybe I'm getting that wrong, but perhaps it's better to think of the substituents in terms of their positions relative to each other.

Now, the challenge is to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to add these substituents in the right order and positions.

I remember that when you substitute benzene, the directing effects of substituents matter. For example, nitration is a meta-directing group, and bromination with FeBr3 is a meta director. However, the ketone group (like acetophenone) is an activating group because it's a ketone attached via a single bond, wait no. Wait, no, ketones attached to benzene are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, more accurately, the ketone is a meta-directing group because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group via resonance, but it's still ortho/para-directing because it's attached via a sigma bond? Or is it meta-directing? Wait, no, acetophenone (a ketone) is a meta-directing group because the carbonyl is deactivating and meta-directing. So when you have a ketone attached to benzene, any new substituent will enter at the meta position relative to the ketone.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The directing effect depends on the substituent. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing. Nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing. Halogens are deactivating but ortho/para-directing because of their resonance effects.

Wait, the ketone group (like in acetophenone) is a meta-directing group because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group. So, when you have a benzene ring with a ketone substituent, any new substituent will go into the meta position relative to the ketone.

So, to have substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone (which is at position 1), perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are added in the correct order such that each new substituent is directed to the right position.

But wait, the target molecule has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So, the ketone is at position 1, and the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, if the ketone is at 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5? No, wait. Each substituent has its own directing effect.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents matters. Let's say first, you introduce a nitro group, then a ketone, then bromine? Or another order.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps.

The target molecule has:

- A ketone group attached to the benzene ring.

- Bromine at position 3 relative to the ketone.

- Nitro group at position 5 relative to the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that they are at ortho and para positions relative to each other, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are in the meta positions relative to each other, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the substituents' positions relative to each other on the benzene ring. The ketone is attached at a certain point, and then the bromine and nitro groups are added in the correct positions.

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the nitro group.

2. Introduce the bromine.

3. Then introduce the ketone.

But wait, that can't be because the ketone is a substituent that needs to be added via Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be done on benzene rings that are deactivated. So, if we already have a nitro group, which is deactivating, then performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group to direct the acylation. So, if the ring is already deactivated, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced first, and then the other substituents are added.

So, the first step could be Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce the ketone. Then, with the ketone as a meta-directing group, we can add bromine in the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, perhaps add the nitro group in the meta position relative to the ketone, but wait, that would be the same as the bromine's position. Hmm, no. Wait, maybe the nitro group is added in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is para to the ketone. No, wait, the ketone is meta-directing, so any substituent would go into the meta position relative to the ketone. But if you add a nitro group after the bromine, perhaps it would go into a different meta position.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are added in such a way that they're in the correct positions without conflicting.

Wait, maybe the order is: first add the nitro group, then bromine, then the ketone. But again, the ketone requires an activating group, and the nitro group is deactivating, so that would prevent the ketone from being added. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after the ketone, which is meta to it, and then the nitro group is added in another position.

Wait, let me think again. Let's list the substituents:

- Ketone (meta-directing, deactivating).

- Bromine (deactivating, ortho/para-directing).

- Nitro group (meta-directing, deactivating).

Hmm.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5.

So, the nitro and bromine are at positions 3 and 5, which are both meta to each other and to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the nitro and bromine are both meta to the ketone. So, when the ketone is attached, the next substituents are added in the meta positions.

But how to get both substituents there.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent is the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone.

But again, after introducing the nitro group, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then the bromine, then the nitro group.

But let's think about the steps.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with CH3COCl and AlCl3. This would give acetophenone, which has the ketone group attached.

Then, step 2: bromination. Bromine with FeBr3 as a catalyst. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the bromine would add at the meta position relative to the ketone. So, in acetophenone, adding Br would give 3-bromoacetophenone.

Step 3: Now, we need to add the nitro group. But where? Using nitration (HNO3 with H2SO4). Since the acetophenone is meta-directing, and the bromine is already at the meta position, where will the nitro group go? Well, the nitration will be directed by the substituents already present. The ring has two substituents: the ketone and the bromine.

The ketone is meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para-directing (since it's a deactivating but ortho/para director). So, the nitro group could be added in a position that's a meta position to the ketone (which is already at position 1), or ortho or para to the bromine.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when you add nitro, after acetophenone and bromine, where will it go?

Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let's think.

Step 1: Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, nitro is a meta director and deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So, you can't do Friedel-Crafts on nitrobenzene because the ring is deactivating. So that would be impossible.

So, the ketone must be introduced before any deactivating groups, because once you have deactivating groups, the ring becomes less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

So, the ketone must be added first, followed by the deactivating substituents.

So, the steps must be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the ketone.

2. Bromination, which goes meta to the ketone.

3. Nitration, which perhaps goes ortho or para to the bromine, but let's check.

Wait, after adding the ketone (position 1) and bromine (position 3), the ring has two substituents. Now, when nitrating, the nitro group can be directed by either the ketone or the bromine.

The ketone is meta-directing, and the bromine is ortho/para-directing. But which one is more influential? The substituent that is more strongly activating or deactivating?

Wait, both are deactivating. So, the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than bromine. So, the nitration will be influenced more by the substituent with the stronger directing effect.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine, being closer, has a stronger influence. Let me think.

In such cases, the nitration would likely occur at positions that are either ortho or para to the bromine, but meta to the ketone. Wait, the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3. The positions available are 2,4,5,6.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1) and para to the bromine (position 3).

Wait, if the ketone is at 1, bromine at 3, then position 5 is meta to 1. So, when nitrating, the nitro group would add at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine.

So, the order would be:

1. Acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Bromination: adds at position 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Nitration: adds at position 5 (meta to ketone, para to Br).

So, the sequence would be: acylation, bromination, nitration.

But looking at the options, which option follows this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation) → ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination) → iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration).

That's acylation first, then bromine, then nitration. That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me look at the other steps in option A. After nitration, it has more steps: iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, but after nitration, why would you need more steps? That seems like more reactions, which might not be necessary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the nitration has to be done in a specific order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before bromine.

Wait, but I thought that after nitro, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, I'm confused.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the bromine is introduced after the nitro group. But that would require adding nitro first, then bromine, then ketone. But that can't work because the ketone requires an activating group.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to consider the substituent's directing effects and the order in which they are added.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: ketone at 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5.

So, perhaps the nitro and bromine are both meta to the ketone.

But how to get them both in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added first, then the nitro group, then the ketone. But no, because the ketone can't be added if the ring is deactivated by nitro or bromine (since both are deactivating).

So, the ketone must be added first, then the other substituents.

So, the correct sequence would be:

1. Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) → acetophenone.

2. Bromination → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitration → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

So, the reaction steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) AcCl, ii) Br2, iii) HNO3. Then, more steps.

Wait, but after nitration, why are there more steps? Because the target only has those three substituents. So, perhaps the options include more steps, but perhaps some steps are unnecessary or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Each option lists seven steps. That seems a lot. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, it's a benzene ring with three substituents: ketone, bromine, nitro. So, all three must be present.

Wait, but I thought the steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration, totaling three steps. But the options have seven steps each, so perhaps each option includes other steps.

Wait, perhaps some steps are for protection or functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs before the bromination.

Wait, let me think again: if I first nitrate the benzene, then acylate, then brominate.

But nitro is deactivating, so acylation won't occur after nitration. So that's not possible.

Thus, the acylation must be first. So, the correct steps are acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: i) AcCl → ii) Br → iii) HNO3. Then steps iv to vii: Fe/HCl, HNO3, NaNO2, H3PO2.

Wait, why after nitration are there more steps? That would imply more reactions, but the target is achieved after step iii. So, perhaps the other steps are not needed or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done in a different position. Maybe after acylation and bromination, the nitration needs to be directed in a certain way, requiring some other reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are introduced via different methods, such as using a directing group.

Another thought: sometimes, when you have multiple substituents, the directing can be influenced by the strongest director. So, in the case of acetophenone (meta-directing) and bromine (ortho/para), which will dominate?

In the case of acetophenone and bromine, the bromine is a stronger activating group? No, wait, bromine is deactivating but ortho/para. Acetophenone is deactivating and meta.

So, when both are present, the nitration may occur where? It depends on which substituent is more influential. I think that the nitration would be directed by the more activating group, but since both are deactivating, it's the position that is most favored by their directing effects.

Wait, in acetophenone, the meta position is activated. But with Br at position 3, which is ortho/para. So, perhaps the nitro group would go into a position ortho or para to the Br, but meta to the ketone.

Wait, if the ketone is at 1, bromine at 3, then the possible positions for nitro are 2 (ortho to Br, meta to ketone?), 4 (para to Br, which is position 3's para is 6?), wait, no.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 3's para would be position 6? Because 1 is the first, 2,3,4,5,6 going around. So, position 3's para is 6, but the ketone is at 1. So, when adding nitro, where would it go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group adds meta to the ketone, which is position 5.

So, in that case, the nitration would be done after bromination, and the nitro would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine?

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, the steps are acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back at the options, option A seems to have these three steps as the first three steps (i, ii, iii). Then, why does it have more steps after?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done before bromination. Let's think.

If I first nitrate the benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Then, I can't acylate because nitro is deactivating. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after the nitro group, but that would require the ring to be activated enough for Friedel-Crafts, which it isn't.

So, back to option A: the steps after iii are iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3; vi) NaNO2; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, Fe/HCl is probably for reducing something, like reducing nitro groups to amine? But the target has a nitro group, so we don't want to reduce it. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl is often used for diazotization, which is used in Sandmeyer reactions to introduce halogens. H3PO2 is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to reduce ketones to methylene groups. But in the target molecule, we have a ketone, so that would not be desirable. So, perhaps those steps would remove the ketone, which is not desired.

Hmm, so option A seems to have steps that would remove the ketone, which is not the case. So, perhaps option A is not the correct sequence.

Looking at option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3; iii) CH3COCl; iv) HNO3; etc.

Wait, that's adding bromine first, which would give bromobenzene. Then nitration of bromobenzene would add nitro group, maybe at para position because bromine is ortho/para directing. Then, acylation.

But wait, can you acylate bromobenzene? Because bromine is a deactivating group, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts acylation might not proceed. So, step iii (CH3COCl) might not work. So, option B is likely incorrect.

Option C: i) HNO3; then Fe/HCl; then CH3COCl.

But as before, nitration first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult. So, option C is probably not correct.

Option D: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2; vi) CH3COCl; vii) HNO3.

This seems complicated. Starting with nitration, then steps that would reduce or modify substituents, then bromination and acylation, then another nitration. That seems unlikely to give the correct product, especially with multiple nitration steps.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct sequence is option A, but the steps after iii are confusing. Alternatively, I might have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, another approach: think about which options have the acylation as the first step.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) AcCl → yes.

Option B: i) Br → no.

Option C: i) HNO3 → no.

Option D: i) HNO3 → no.

So, only option A has the acylation as the first step.

But, why does option A have more steps?

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and the rest of the steps are not needed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii is not the correct position. Maybe the nitration needs to happen after some other step.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes, when you have two meta directors, the substituents can end up in the correct positions. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done before the bromine is added, but that would require having the ring activated.

Wait, but I already thought that the ketone must be added first.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, would that work?

Acylation gives acetophenone. Nitration would add nitro group meta to the ketone, at position 5. Then bromination would add at position 3, meta to the ketone and para to the nitro group.

So, the steps would be:

1. AcCl → acetophenone.

2. HNO3 → 5-nitroacetophenone.

3. Br2 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which is the desired product.

So, the sequence is i, iii, ii. Looking at the options, does any option do that?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii. So, acylation, bromination, nitration. That's not the same as acylation, nitration, bromination.

So, perhaps another option follows that order.

Looking at the options:

Option B: i) Br; ii) HNO3; iii) AcCl.

No, that's acylation as third step.

Option C: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) AcCl.

No, acylation is third.

Option D: i) HNO3; then other steps, then Br and AcCl.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options have the correct order except option A. But option A's steps after iii don't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target molecule again. The correct substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the nitration comes before the bromination. So, if the nitro group is added before the bromine, where would it go?

After acylation (position 1), if I nitrate, the nitro goes to position 5. Then bromination would go to position 3.

That would give the correct product.

So, the steps are:

i) AcCl → acetophenone.

ii) HNO3 → 5-nitroacetophenone.

iii) Br2 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which is the desired product.

Looking at the options, which option does acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking at the options, option A has steps i, ii, iii as AcCl, Br2, HNO3. So, that's acylate, brominate, then nitrate. Which leads to the bromine at 3, then nitration would be directed by the bromine and ketone.

Wait, but in that case, after AcCl and Br2, the ring has Ac and Br. Then, during nitration, where would the nitro group add?

As before, the ring has Ac at 1, Br at 3.

During nitration, the nitro group would add where? It's influenced by both substituents. The Ac is meta-directing, and Br is ortho/para-directing.

The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

If the Ac is at 1, Br at 3. So, the nitro group can be added at position 5 (meta to Ac and para to Br). Because position 5 is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine, which is possible.

So, if the sequence is Ac, Br, then nitrate, the nitro would end up at 5. That would give the correct product.

So, option A would have steps i, ii, iii as AcCl, Br2, HNO3, which would produce the desired product. Then, why are there more steps in option A?

Because the target is achieved after step iii, the remaining steps (iv to vii) must be incorrect or perhaps leading to side reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the product requires some workup steps, but in the given options, the steps after iii in option A are not needed for the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence requires more steps, but the correct order is in option A.

Wait, but looking at option A's steps:

i) AcCl → acetophenone.

ii) Br2 → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

So, after step iii, the target is achieved. The steps iv to vii probably do something else, which might be incorrect, but perhaps the question is only considering the necessary steps, so the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but then why are steps iv to vii present? Because they're part of the sequence. So, perhaps the correct option is not A, because the steps after iii would alter the product.

Looking at option A's steps iv to vii:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce something, maybe the nitro group? But that would give an amine, which is not desired.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration step? That would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, maybe to make a diazonium salt.

vii) H3PO2 → Wolff-Kishner, which would reduce the ketone to a methylene group, converting ethanone to ethane. Which would destroy the ketone, which is not desired.

So, option A includes steps that would actually degrade the desired product, which can't be correct. Therefore, option A cannot be the correct sequence.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Are steps iv to vii part of the same synthesis, but not all necessary?

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps are not part of the necessary sequence but are included as distractors.

But the question states that the sequence should lead to the high-yield synthesis of the target. So, unnecessary steps that could degrade the product would make option A incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is not option A.

Looking again, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination. So, let's see which option does that.

Looking at the options, does any option have i) AcCl, then iii) HNO3, then ii) Br2?

Looking at the options, option B has i) Br2, then ii) HNO3, then iii) AcCl. No.

Option C: i) HNO3, then iii) AcCl. No.

Option D: i) HNO3, then steps, then Br2, then AcCl. No.

Hmm. So, perhaps none of the options have the correct order, but since the options are given, I must choose the best possible option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the nitration is done after bromination, but in a different position.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after acylation and bromination, the nitration occurs in a different position.

Wait, during bromination, the ring has Ac at 1 and Br at 3. During nitration, the nitro group adds at position 5, which is meta to Ac and para to Br.

Thus, the correct product is formed. So, the steps in option A's first three steps would yield the correct product.

But then, why are the other steps present in option A? That seems like a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the target isn't achieved until all seven steps are done, but that seems unlikely.

But the target molecule doesn't require any steps beyond the third, so the other steps would be extra.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps in the option are correct, and the other steps aren't necessary, but the question requires selecting the sequence that leads to the target, regardless of extra steps.

But that seems unlikely; the other steps would change the product.

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, then nitration, which is option A's steps i, ii, iii. Then, the other steps are not relevant or perhaps a mistake.

But looking again, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ethan-1-one. So, after the first three steps of option A, we have that. So, perhaps the other steps in option A are not part of the required synthesis but are distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the correct sequence is the first three steps, and the rest are not part of the correct pathway.

But since the options list all seven steps, I must consider all.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the nitration step. Maybe the nitration in option A is not at the correct position.

Wait, after acylation and bromination, the ring has Ac at 1 and Br at 3.

Nitration would then add nitro group at position 5, which is meta to Ac and para to Br.

So, that's correct.

Thus, the first three steps of option A yield the desired product. The other steps (iv to vii) are perhaps not part of the required synthesis. So, perhaps the correct option is A, but the rest of the steps are distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, option D's steps: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2; vi) AcCl; vii) HNO3.

That seems like an incorrect sequence, as it starts with nitration, which would prevent acylation.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I have to choose the best possible.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the directing effects. Let me recheck.

If the ketone is at 1, and the bromine is at 3 (meta), then during nitration, the nitro group would go to position 5 (meta to ketone and para to bromine), which is correct.

Thus, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back, only option A has this as the first three steps.

So, despite the extra steps, option A's steps i, ii, iii are correct. Thus, the answer should be option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone group first, followed by bromination and nitration in the appropriate positions. The ketone group is meta-directing and deactivating, so it must be introduced early to allow subsequent reactions to proceed. Bromination and nitration must then occur in the correct positions relative to the ketone.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → introduces the ketone at position 1.  
     ii) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) → adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
     iii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → adds nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to the bromine).  
   - After step iii, the target molecule is formed. The additional steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary and potentially destructive (e.g., reducing the ketone or adding extra nitro groups). However, the first three steps are correct.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) → introduces bromine.  
     ii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → adds nitro group.  
     iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → attempts to introduce the ketone.  
   - Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration because nitro is a strong deactivator. This sequence is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → introduces nitro group.  
     ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
     iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → attempts to introduce the ketone.  
   - Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration because nitro is a strong deactivator. This sequence is incorrect.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Steps:  
     i) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → introduces nitro group.  
     ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
     iii) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → forms a diazonium salt.  
     iv) Wolff-Kishner reduction (H₃PO₂) → reduces the ketone to a methylene group.  
     v) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) → adds bromine.  
     vi) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) → attempts to introduce the ketone.  
     vii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → adds another nitro group.  
   - This sequence starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation. Additionally, the Wolff-Kishner reduction destroys the ketone. This sequence is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only sequence that correctly introduces the ketone first, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct positions, is **Option A**. Despite the inclusion of unnecessary steps after the third, the first three steps are correct and lead to the desired product.
