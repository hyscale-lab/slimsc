Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave is not allowed based on conservation laws.

Wait, the initial state is a 1S0 state. The 1S0 notation... Oh right, the general term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0, L is 0 (since it's S state), so J must be L + S, which is 0 + 0 = 0. So the initial state has J=0, S=0, L=0. Got it.

The problem says that the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the initial NN state is 1S0, and it emits X to become another NN state plus X. Let me think about the final state.

The Pauli exclusion principle comes into play here. The problem statement gives an equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that formula, but I think it's related to the isospin, spin, and angular momentum of the final state. Oh right, Pauli statistics require that the product of the exchange symmetries (for identical particles) must be even. So when two nucleons are involved, their state must be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange based on their overall quantum numbers.

So the given equation is T + S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. Wait, no, the problem says T = S + L +1 mod2. Hmm, perhaps it's that the product of the exchange symmetries for isospin, spin, and orbital parts must be even. So the overall parity under exchange is (-1)^(L+1) for spin, since spin exchange is symmetric for even S and antisymmetric for odd. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula, but I think I can proceed.

The problem says the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T=0. Plugging into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod2. That simplifies to S + L ≡ 1 mod2. So S and L must have opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

So the final state's spin S and orbital angular momentum L must satisfy S + L is odd.

Now, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity considerations come into play. The initial state has parity P_initial. Let's think about that. The initial state is 1S0. For a two-nucleon system, the parity is given by (-1)^L, since for each nucleon, the orbital part contributes (-1)^L. Wait, no, because for identical particles, the parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the intrinsic parity of the particles. Wait, each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, right? Because for protons and neutrons, their intrinsic parity is +1. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Or maybe not, since for identical particles, the overall parity is more complicated.

Wait, no. The parity of a two-body state is given by the product of the intrinsic parity of each particle and (-1)^L. But since both nucleons are identical fermions, their intrinsic parities are the same. So the parity would be (+1)^2 * (-1)^L = (-1)^L. So initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the system emits a particle X, the parity of the entire system must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (P_initial) is +1. The final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. So P_final = P_NN * P_X.

Wait, no, because when you have a two-body system plus another particle, the parity of the entire process is P_initial = P_final (since parity is conserved in strong interactions, but wait, X could be a pion, which is a pseudoscalar, so parity is not conserved in weak interactions... Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume parity is conserved. Or maybe the problem considers only strong interactions, where parity is conserved. So I think we can proceed under the assumption that parity is conserved, so P_initial = P_final.

So the initial parity is +1. The final state consists of the NN state and the particle X. The parity of the NN state is (-1)^L_NN, and the parity of X is given as -1. So the total parity is [ (-1)^L_NN ] * [ P_X ].

Wait, but the total parity is the product of the parity of the NN part and the parity of X. So P_final = (-1)^L_NN * (-1) = (-1)^{L_NN +1}.

But since initial parity is +1, we have:

(-1)^{L_NN +1} = +1.

So (-1)^{L_NN +1} = 1 → (-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{ -1 } → but wait, (-1)^{n} = 1 if n is even, -1 if odd. So:

(-1)^{L_NN +1} = 1 → (L_NN +1) must be even → L_NN must be odd.

So L_NN is odd.

Earlier, we had from the Pauli condition that S + L is 1 mod2. Since L is odd, S must be even. Because even + odd = odd.

So S must be even.

But wait, the possible spin states are S=0,1,2..., but for two nucleons, the maximum S is 1 (since each has spin 1/2, so S can be 0 or 1). So S can be 0 or 1.

From the condition S + L is 1 mod2, and L is odd, so S must be even. So S must be 0.

Because if S is 0 (even), then 0 + L (odd) = odd → which is 1 mod2. That fits.

So the final NN state has S=0 and L=odd.

Wait, but what about the possible angular momentum of the NN system? The initial state is J=0 (since L=0, S=0, J=0). So the final state must have J=0 as well, because angular momentum is conserved.

Wait, no. Because the emission of a particle X would carry away some angular momentum. So the initial state has J=0, and when it emits X, the total angular momentum should be the sum of the NN state's J and X's angular momentum. So the total J_initial is 0, so J_final (NN) + J_X must equal J_initial. Wait, but J_initial is 0, so J_final (NN) must equal - J_X, but since angular momentum is a vector, the sum must be zero. So J_NN + J_X = 0 → J_NN = - J_X → in magnitude, |J_NN| = |J_X|, but their directions must be opposite.

Wait, but I think we can think of it in terms of quantum numbers. The initial state has J=0, so the sum of the final state's J (NN) and X's J must be zero. So the possible J for the NN state plus J for X must be zero. So the possible J for NN state and X must be the same magnitude but opposite directions.

Alternatively, the total angular momentum after emission is J_NN + J_X = J_initial = 0. So the vector sum must be zero. So J_NN and J_X must have the same magnitude and opposite directions. So their magnitudes are equal and their spins are opposite.

But perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, we can consider the possible angular momentum states for the NN system and X.

But perhaps I should proceed by looking at each option and evaluating whether they satisfy the conditions.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p

C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f

D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. The options are transitions from 1S0 to a state plus the emitted particle.

Wait, no. Each option shows the initial state (left) and the final state, which includes the NN state plus X. So for example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the NN state is 7D1, and X is a p (a particle with angular momentum l=1, since p is the letter for l=1).

Wait, but the initial state's J is 0. The final state's NN has J= J_NN, and X has J_X. The sum of their angular momenta (vectorially) should be zero. So |J_NN - J_X| ≤ 0 ≤ J_NN + J_X → which is only possible if J_NN = J_X and opposite in direction. So the magnitude of J_NN must equal J_X.

Wait, but J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is L_NN + S_NN. We already determined that S=0 and L is odd. So J_NN = L_NN (since S=0). So J_NN = L_NN, which is odd.

But L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. So in the final state, the NN state has L= something odd.

Now, the emitted particle X has its own angular momentum. Let's say X has angular momentum l (lowercase), which is the orbital part. The parity of X is given as -1, which is the intrinsic parity (so the parity is (-1)^{l+1} for a pseudoscalar, but wait, the intrinsic parity is given as -1. So for a spin-0 particle, parity is (-1)^0 * intrinsic = 1 * (-1) = -1. For a spin-1 (vector) particle, parity is (-1)^1 * intrinsic = -1 * (-1) = +1. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the intrinsic parity is for the particle, so for a pseudoscalar (like pion), it has intrinsic parity -1 and spin 0. For a vector meson (spin 1), intrinsic parity +1. But the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So perhaps X is a pseudoscalar, so l=0.

Wait, but the options have X as p (l=1), f (l=3), s (l=0), etc. Hmm, but wait, the letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So for example, p is l=1, f is l=3, s is l=0, D is l=2, P is l=1, S is l=0.

Wait no. The notation in the options is lowercase letters, so like p, s, etc. The letters denote the orbital angular momentum. So p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.

So each option's X has l as per the letter. So in option A, the emitted X is p, meaning l=1.

But the parity of X is intrinsic parity -1. So for X, parity P_X = (-1)^{l} * intrinsic_parity.

Wait, no. The parity of a particle is determined by its orbital angular momentum and its intrinsic parity. For a particle with spin j and orbital angular momentum l, the parity is P = (-1)^l * intrinsic_parity.

So for X, if it's a pseudoscalar (like pion), it has spin 0 and intrinsic parity -1. So parity is (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1. Which matches the problem statement.

Similarly, if X is a spin-1 (vector) particle, it would have intrinsic parity +1, so P = (-1)^l * 1. So for l=1, P would be (-1)^1 *1 = -1. But that's a different particle, like a rho meson.

But in any case, the X has intrinsic parity -1, so P_X = (-1)^l * (-1).

Now, the parity of the final state is P_NN * P_X. But wait, the parity of the final state (including both NN and X) must be the same as the initial parity, which is +1.

So P_final = P_NN * P_X = (-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ].

Wait, but the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_NN}, as earlier. And the parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1) because its intrinsic parity is -1.

So P_final = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ] = (-1)^{L_NN + l + 1}.

But since P_initial = +1, we have (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = +1 → L_NN + l +1 must be even → L_NN + l ≡ 1 mod2.

So L_NN is odd (from earlier condition), and l must be even because L_NN is odd, so L_NN + l = odd + even = odd → 1 mod2. Which would make L_NN + l +1 = even.

So for the parity condition, l must be even.

Therefore, l must be even. So X must have even angular momentum.

Looking at the options, X's l is determined by its letter:

A) p → l=1 → odd → violates l must be even → parity condition not met.

B) p → same as A, l=1 → odd → not allowed.

C) f → l=3 → odd → no. Wait, no: wait, l needs to be even. So 3 is odd, which would make L_NN + l = odd + odd = even → even +1 (from the +1 in the parity formula) would be odd → so, no. Wait, no, I think I got it wrong earlier.

Wait, from the parity condition, L_NN is odd, and l must be even: because L_NN + l must be odd.

Wait, earlier conclusion was that L_NN is odd, and l must be even to make L_NN + l odd. Because L_NN is odd, l even → odd + even = odd → which when added to 1 (from the +1 in the parity equation) gives even.

Wait, no, the parity equation is:

(-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = 1 → exponent must be even.

So L_NN + l +1 even → L_NN + l must be odd.

So since L_NN is odd, l must be even (because odd + even = odd). So l must be even.

So X's orbital angular momentum l must be even. So l=0,2,4,...

Looking at the options, X's letters are:

A) p → l=1 → odd → not allowed.

B) p → same → not allowed.

C) f → l=3 → odd → not allowed.

D) s → l=0 → even → allowed.

Wait, but wait, in the options, each option's X is given as p, s, f, etc. So for option D, X is s, which is l=0 (even), so it's allowed. So options A, B, C have X with l odd, which is not allowed.

Wait, but only one of the options is invalid. The question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options A, B, C, D: which ones violate the condition that l must be even?

Wait, so the correct condition is that l must be even. So any option where X has l odd is not allowed. So options A, B, C have X with l=1, l=1, l=3, which are odd. Only option D has X with l=0 (even), so it's allowed. So the forbidden states are A, B, C. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options are the possible final states, and we need to find which one is not allowed. So the forbidden options are those where l is odd, which are A, B, C.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them have X with l even except A, B, and C. So the forbidden option must be among A, B, C.

Wait, but the problem says to find which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should consider the angular momentum conservation.

The initial state has J=0. The final state's NN has J_NN, and X has J_X. The sum of their angular momenta must be zero. So the possible combinations are when J_NN and J_X are such that J_NN + J_X = 0. But since angular momentum is a vector, this implies that J_NN = J_X in magnitude but opposite in direction. So |J_NN| = |J_X|.

But J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is L_NN + S_NN. Since S_NN =0 (from earlier condition), J_NN = L_NN. And L_NN is odd (from earlier conclusion), so J_NN is an odd integer.

So J_X must be equal to L_NN in magnitude, so J_X = L_NN.

But J_X is the total angular momentum of X, which is the sum of its orbital angular momentum l and its spin. Wait, but X is a (presumably) spin-0 particle, like a pion. Because the pion is a pseudoscalar with spin 0. So for X, J_X = l, since spin is zero.

So J_X = l.

Thus, l must equal L_NN.

But L_NN is odd, so l must be odd.

Wait, this contradicts earlier conclusion that l must be even.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Let me re-examine.

From parity conservation:

P_initial = +1.

P_final = P_NN * P_X = (+1).

P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN}.

P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) (since intrinsic parity is -1).

So P_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1}.

Set equal to +1 → (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = 1 → exponent must be even.

So L_NN + l +1 is even → L_NN + l is odd.

Earlier, from Pauli condition, we have L_NN is odd and S=0.

So L_NN is odd.

So for L_NN + l to be odd, l must be even because odd + even = odd.

So l must be even.

But from angular momentum conservation, J_NN = L_NN (since S=0), and J_X = l (since X's spin is 0).

So J_NN = L_NN, J_X = l.

But since J_initial is 0, J_NN = - J_X → L_NN = l.

Because the vector sum is zero, so J_NN = - J_X → L_NN = l.

But from parity condition, L_NN is odd and l must be even.

So L_NN = l → odd = even → which is impossible.

So this is a contradiction. So there's a problem somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that X's spin is zero. What if X has spin? Because in the problem statement, X's intrinsic parity is -1, but it doesn't specify its spin. So perhaps X is a spin-1 particle with intrinsic parity -1.

Wait, but for a spin-1 particle, parity is (-1)^l * intrinsic_parity. If X has spin 1, and intrinsic_parity -1, then P_X = (-1)^l * (-1).

But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps X has spin 1/2? But that's less likely.

Wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. Let's think of X as a pseudoscalar (spin 0) particle, which has intrinsic parity -1. So for X, l would be 0, so J_X = l =0.

But then, from angular momentum conservation, J_NN must be 0 as well, since J_NN + J_X = 0.

But J_NN = L_NN (since S=0) → L_NN =0. But earlier, from parity condition, L_NN must be odd. Which is a contradiction. So X cannot be spin 0.

Alternatively, if X has spin 1, then J_X = l + s, where s is spin. But if X is a vector meson, spin 1, and intrinsic parity +1 (because for spin 1, intrinsic parity is +1). So P_X = (-1)^l * (+1).

In that case, the parity condition would be:

P_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^l * (+1) ].

Set equal to +1:

(-1)^{L_NN + l} = 1 → L_NN + l even.

Earlier, we have L_NN is odd, so l must be odd to make L_NN + l even.

So l must be odd.

From angular momentum conservation: J_NN = L_NN (since S=0), and J_X = l + s, but for X, J_X can be l ± s. But since X's spin is 1, l can be any value, but let's think about the possible J_X.

If X has spin 1, then J_X can be |l-1| to |l+1| in integer steps.

But for X's J to be equal to J_NN in magnitude, because J_NN = L_NN = odd, and J_X must have J_X = L_NN → but J_X is the total angular momentum of X, which would be sqrt( (l +1)(l +1 + 2) ) or something? Wait, no. Wait, J_X is the vector sum of l and s (spin). If X's spin is 1, then for a given l, the possible J_X can be l+1, l, l-1, provided that l and 1 have the same parity.

Wait, but for J_NN to equal J_X, which is determined by l and spin of X.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the only way J_NN = J_X is when J_X is equal to L_NN, which is odd, and J_X is the magnitude of X's angular momentum, which includes both orbital and spin parts.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently.

The initial J is 0, so the final state's J_NN plus J_X must be zero. So J_NN = - J_X.

But J_NN is a vector, so its magnitude is |J_NN|, and J_X's magnitude is |J_X|, so |J_NN| = |J_X|.

But J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is L + S. Since S=0, J_NN = L, which is odd. So |J_NN| = L_NN, which is odd.

So |J_X| must be equal to L_NN, which is odd.

If X's spin is 0, then J_X = l. So l must be odd.

If X's spin is 1, then J_X can be l+1, l, or l-1. So for |J_X| to be odd, l must be such that l+1 is odd, which would require l even. Or l-1 is odd → l even as well. Because if l is even, l+1 is odd. If l is odd, l-1 is even.

Wait, let's think: for X to have |J_X| = odd (since L_NN is odd), if X's spin is 1 and l is even.

For example, if l=2 (even), then possible J_X values are 3,2,1. So |J_X| can be 3, which is odd.

So in this case, l=2 is acceptable because J_X can be 2+1=3, which is the same as L_NN=3 (if L_NN=3), for example.

But earlier, from the parity condition, when X has spin 1, l must be odd because L_NN is odd (from L_NN + l must be even → L_NN is odd, l must be odd for their sum to be even).

Wait, no, earlier when X has spin 1, the parity condition was L_NN + l even.

Because P_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^l * (+1) ] = (-1)^{L_NN + l} = 1.

So L_NN + l must be even.

Since L_NN is odd, l must be odd.

So l is odd → J_X can be l ±1, etc.

But J_X must match L_NN, which is odd.

If l is odd, then possible J_X can be l+1 (even), l (odd), or l-1 (even). So only J_X = l (which is odd) would match.

So J_X must be l, which is odd. But J_X is l only if spin doesn't contribute, which requires that the spin part is aligned in a way that their vector sum is J_X = l.

But this isn't straightforward.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to approach each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse this term symbol.

The term is 7D1. The general term is (2S+1)L(J).

So 7D1 → 2S+1 =7 → S=3. But wait, two nucleons can have maximum S=1. So this is impossible. So option A is invalid because S=3 is not possible. So this option is forbidden.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So maybe it's possible only for certain S and L. Hmm, but S=3 is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles. So this option is impossible regardless.

But let me check the other options.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

The term is 3S1. So (2S+1) =3 → S=1.

L is S, so L=0 (since it's S state). So J = L + S = 0 +1=1.

But earlier, we have from Pauli condition that S + L must be 1 mod2. Here, S=1, L=0 → sum is 1 → which is 1 mod2. So this fits.

Now, X is p, which is l=1.

From the parity condition earlier, when X has spin 1, l must be odd. So l=1 is allowed.

Now, the parity of the final state would be:

P_NN = (-1)^L = (-1)^0=1.

P_X = (-1)^l * intrinsic_parity. Intrinsic parity is +1 for X with spin 1. So P_X = (-1)^1 * (+1) = -1.

So P_final = 1 * (-1) = -1. But the initial parity is +1. So this would violate parity conservation. So this transition is forbidden.

Wait, but earlier I thought the parity condition requires that P_final = +1. So this option leads to P_final=-1, which is not allowed.

So option B is invalid.

Option C: 1S0 → 3D3 + f.

The term is 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D → 2.

So L=2, which is even. Earlier condition from Pauli is S + L =1 mod2. Here, 1 +2=3 → 1 mod2. So fits.

X is f → l=3.

From parity condition, when X has spin 1, l must be odd. So l=3 is allowed.

Parity of NN is (-1)^L = (-1)^2=1.

X's parity: (-1)^3 * (+1) = -1.

So P_final = 1 * (-1) = -1 → which doesn't match initial parity of +1. So this is forbidden.

Option D: 1S0 → 3P0 + s.

The term is 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P →1.

So L=1, which is odd. Then S + L =1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. But earlier condition requires S + L =1 mod2. So this doesn't fit. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, from the Pauli condition, we have T=0 → S + L must be 1 mod2. So S + L =1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2 → violates the condition. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option A was invalid because of S=3, which is impossible. So options A, B, C, D have various issues.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the problem is looking for the option where the angular momentum state isn't allowed based on the conditions.

Wait, but according to earlier analysis, L_NN must be odd (from parity condition), and from Pauli condition, S=0.

Wait, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to summarize.

After the emission, the final NN state has:

- T=0.

- From Pauli: S + L ≡1 mod2 → S=0 (since L is odd).

So S=0, L is odd.

So the term symbol for the NN state must have S=0 and L odd.

So the possible term symbols are 1L^J, where L is odd (like P, F, etc.), and J = L + S = L.

So the allowed L for the NN state are 1,3,5 etc.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 → impossible.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0, which is even → violates L must be odd.

Option C:3D3 → L=2, even → violates L must be odd.

Option D:3P0 → L=1, odd → allowed. But S=1, which would require S + L=1+1=2 → even → violates the condition that S + L must be 1 mod2.

Wait, so in option D, S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2 → doesn't fit the condition S + L ≡1.

So option D is invalid.

So, the only option that doesn't violate the conditions would be something with S=0 and L odd.

Looking back, none of the options seem to fit except perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the parity condition. Let me re-examine.

Wait, we have:

P_final = P_NN * P_X.

P_NN is (-1)^L_NN.

P_X is (-1)^l * intrinsic_parity_X.

Intrinsic_parity_X is -1.

So P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.

Thus, P_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1}.

Set to +1 → L_NN + l +1 even → L_NN + l must be odd.

From Pauli condition, L_NN is odd.

So l must be even.

So l must be even.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X is p → l=1 → odd → forbidden.

Option B: X is p → l=1 → forbidden.

Option C: X is f → l=3 → odd → forbidden.

Option D: X is s → l=0 → even → allowed.

So only option D's X has l even. So the other options are forbidden by the parity condition.

But from angular momentum conservation, J_NN must equal J_X because their sum is zero. J_NN is L_NN (since S=0) → which is odd.

J_X is sqrt( (l + s)(l + s +1) ... ), but if X is a spin-0 particle (pseudoscalar), then J_X = l.

So L_NN = l → but L_NN is odd, so l must be odd. Which contradicts the parity condition that l must be even.

This suggests that X cannot be spin-0. So perhaps X has spin 1.

If X has spin 1, then J_X can be l ±1, etc. So for J_X = L_NN (which is odd), l must be even because L_NN is odd, and J_X must be odd. So if l is even, then J_X could be l +1 (which is odd). For example, l=2 → J_X can be 3.

In this case, J_NN =3 (L_NN=3, S=0), and J_X=3 (from l=2 and spin 1 → J_X=3).

So this could work.

But earlier, the parity condition requires l even.

So for X with spin 1, l must be even.

So for option B: X is p → l=1 (odd) → violates parity condition. So forbidden.

Option C: X is f → l=3 (odd) → forbidden.

Option A: X is p → l=1 → forbidden.

Option D: X is s → l=0 (even) → allowed.

So among the options, only option D has X with l even, which satisfies the parity condition, but what about angular momentum?

In option D, the final NN state is 3P0 → S=1, L=1 → J=0.

But earlier, we have S must be 0. So this is a problem.

Wait, so the final NN state must have S=0 and L odd.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 3P0 → S=1, L=1 → S=1, which violates S=0.

Options A, B, C: their S is either 3 (invalid) or S=1 with L even (invalid).

So none of the options seem to satisfy the conditions, but the question says one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity condition. Let me recheck.

The parity condition is:

P_final = P_NN * P_X = (+1).

P_NN = (-1)^L.

P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) (since intrinsic parity is -1).

So:

(-1)^L * (-1)^{l+1} =1 → (-1)^{L + l +1} =1 → L + l +1 even → L + l must be odd.

Since L is odd (from earlier), l must be even.

So l must be even.

Now, looking for options where X has l even.

Only option D has X with l=0 (even).

But option D's final state is 3P0: S=1, L=1 → which violates the Pauli condition (S + L = 2 → even → 0 mod2, but needs to be 1 mod2).

So option D's final state is invalid.

Thus, all options have X with l odd (A, B, C) except D, which has l even but the final state is invalid.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that no option is valid, but the question expects one to be invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition.

The problem says T= S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

So 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So S + L must be odd.

So for each option, check S + L.

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 (invalid).

Option B: 3S1 → S=1, L=0 → sum 1 → allowed.

Option C:3D3 → S=1, L=2 → sum 3 → allowed.

Option D:3P0 → S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → even → forbidden.

So options B and C are allowed, but A and D are not.

But from parity condition, only option D's X has l even. So option B and C have X with l=1 and 3 (odd), which violates the parity condition.

So the options that are forbidden are A, B, C because their X's l is odd, and D because its S + L is even.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options that have X with l even are allowed in terms of parity, but their final state's S + L must be 1 mod2.

Only option D has X with l even, but its S + L is even.

So the only option that is forbidden based on both conditions is option D, because despite having X with l even, the NN state's S + L is even, violating the Pauli condition.

Wait, but option D's X has l even, which satisfies the parity condition, but the final state's S + L is even, which violates the Pauli condition. So option D is invalid.

But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but let me look again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to only consider the parity condition, and ignore the Pauli condition for the options.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. I think I've spent enough time, and perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a \( ^1S_0 \) state emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \(-1\). The goal is to determine which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation laws, including angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State**:  
   The initial state is \( ^1S_0 \), which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State Conditions**:  
   - The emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\).  
   - The parity of the final state is given by \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \), where \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \) and \( P_X = (-1)^l \cdot (-1) \) (since \( X \)'s intrinsic parity is \(-1\)).  
   - Conservation of parity requires \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \), leading to \( (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}} + l + 1} = +1 \). This implies \( L_{\text{NN}} + l + 1 \) is even, or equivalently, \( L_{\text{NN}} + l \) is odd.  
   - From the Pauli exclusion principle, \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Since \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), it follows that \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This means \( S_{\text{NN}} \) and \( L_{\text{NN}} \) must have opposite parity.

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   The initial state has \( J = 0 \), so the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + \( X \)) must also sum to zero. This implies \( J_{\text{NN}} = J_X \) in magnitude but opposite in direction. For the NN system, \( J_{\text{NN}} = L_{\text{NN}} + S_{\text{NN}} \). Since \( S_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) (from the Pauli condition), \( J_{\text{NN}} = L_{\text{NN}} \). For \( X \), \( J_X = l \) (if \( X \) is spin-0) or \( J_X = l \pm 1 \) (if \( X \) has spin-1).

4. **Parity and Angular Momentum Constraints**:  
   - From the parity condition, \( L_{\text{NN}} + l \) must be odd.  
   - From the Pauli condition, \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), and since \( S_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} \) must be odd.  
   - Combining these, \( l \) must be even to satisfy \( L_{\text{NN}} + l \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), where \( L_{\text{NN}} \) is odd.

### Evaluation of Options

- **Option A: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^7D_1 + p \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( {}^7D_1 \), which implies \( S = 3 \). This is impossible for two nucleons, as the maximum \( S \) is 1.  
  - **Conclusion**: Invalid due to \( S = 3 \), which is unphysical.

- **Option B: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^3S_1 + p \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( {}^3S_1 \), which implies \( S = 1 \) and \( L = 0 \).  
  - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd (satisfied).  
  - Pauli condition: \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (satisfied).  
  - However, \( X \) has \( l = 1 \), which is odd, violating the parity condition \( l \) must be even.  
  - **Conclusion**: Invalid due to \( l = 1 \), which is odd.

- **Option C: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^3D_3 + f \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( {}^3D_3 \), which implies \( S = 1 \) and \( L = 2 \).  
  - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd (satisfied).  
  - Pauli condition: \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd (satisfied).  
  - However, \( X \) has \( l = 3 \), which is odd, violating the parity condition \( l \) must be even.  
  - **Conclusion**: Invalid due to \( l = 3 \), which is odd.

- **Option D: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^3P_0 + s \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( {}^3P_0 \), which implies \( S = 1 \) and \( L = 1 \).  
  - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (satisfied).  
  - Pauli condition: \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even (violated).  
  - Additionally, \( X \) has \( l = 0 \), which is even, satisfying the parity condition. However, the Pauli condition is not satisfied.  
  - **Conclusion**: Invalid due to \( S + L = 2 \), which is even.
