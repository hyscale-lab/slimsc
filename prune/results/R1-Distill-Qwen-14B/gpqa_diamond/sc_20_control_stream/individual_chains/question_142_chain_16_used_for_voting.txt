Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their positions in qubit space. Hmm, I think I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, each of those terms is a projector, right? So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that's 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere, same with |1⟩⟨1|. When I add them together, each of their diagonal elements would add up. So |0⟩⟨0| has (1,0,0,0) in a vectorized form, and |1⟩⟨1| has (0,0,1,0)? Or wait, no, maybe I should consider them as 2x2 matrices. 

Actually, I think |0⟩⟨0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal, right? So [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| would be [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding those together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 in all diagonal positions and 0 elsewhere.

Wait, what's the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space? I remember that qubits are two-dimensional, so the space of density matrices is four-dimensional. But here, I think the question is referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh, right! The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. But wait, Bloch vectors are for pure states, right? Because a density matrix for a pure state can be written as |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and that corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere.

But ρ here is a mixed state. Because it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is like an equal probability of being in state 0 or state 1. So this should be a completely mixed state for a single qubit. The completely mixed state is represented by the identity matrix divided by 2. Because for a qubit, the identity matrix I/2 is the maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the origin is the completely mixed state. So the density matrix I/2 would correspond to the point (0,0,0) in the Bloch sphere coordinates. But wait, how are the coordinates mapped? The Bloch vector is (x,y,z), where each component corresponds to the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (x,y,z). Solving for r, if ρ is I/2, then r·σ must be zero. So r would be (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin. But wait, what's the question again? Oh, the question asks for the geometrical position in the qubits space. So the density matrix ρ is at the origin of the Bloch sphere because it's the completely mixed state. So the answer should be option C.

Let me just double-check. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ would have a Bloch vector pointing to some point on the sphere. For example, |0⟩ is at (0,0,1), and |+x⟩ is at (1,0,0). But when it's a mixed state like (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, the Bloch vector points to the origin because there's no coherence and it's equally mixed between the two orthogonal states. So yes, the position is (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix \(\rho\) is related to the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) by the relation:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), the term \(r \cdot \sigma\) must vanish, which implies \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the density matrix corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\).
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** This corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\), which is option C.
