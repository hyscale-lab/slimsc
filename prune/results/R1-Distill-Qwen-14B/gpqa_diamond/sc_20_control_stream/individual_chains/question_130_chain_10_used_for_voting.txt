Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, specifically about redshift and detecting objects using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, the question is about detecting these absorption lines using optical ground-based telescopes. Oh right, because the Lyman alpha is in UV, but if the cloud is at a high redshift, the wavelength might shift into the optical range, which ground-based telescopes can observe.

So the main idea here is redshift. The redshift (z) determines how much the wavelength stretches. When a quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs at its rest wavelength (1216 Angstroms) but if the cloud is moving away, that wavelength is redshifted. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z).

But optical telescopes can't see UV light because the atmosphere absorbs it; we need space telescopes like Hubble for UV. So for ground-based optical telescopes, the Lyman alpha absorption must have shifted into the visible spectrum. So we need to find the minimum redshift where 1216 Angstroms (rest) is shifted into the optical range, say around 4000 Angstroms or visible light.

Wait, what's the optical range? Visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So if the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms rest, then when it's redshifted, it needs to be within visible range.

So the equation is lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). We want lambda_obs to be greater than or equal to the cutoff of the UV range, which the atmosphere blocks. Oh wait, but ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms). Wait, no, 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms? No, wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms? Wait no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), I think.

Wait, no. Wait, the atmosphere is opaque to UV below about 300 nm, which is 3000 Angstroms. So for ground-based telescopes to detect the absorption line, the observed wavelength must be longer than 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So lambda_obs >= 3000 Angstroms.

So 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000

Solving for z:

(1 + z) >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.4658

So z >= 2.4658 -1 = 1.4658.

Wait, but wait. So the minimum redshift is when lambda_obs is exactly 3000 Angstroms. Because if it's lower than that, the ground telescopes can't see it. So z must be at least about 1.466.

Looking at the options: the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, wait, my calculation gives z=about 1.466. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest higher option is D)1.9 or B)1.2.

Wait, maybe I messed up the cutoff. Let me think again. Maybe the cutoff is higher. Because if the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical, perhaps the lower limit is where Lyman alpha is just entering the observed range, but is it 3000 or 4000 Angstroms?

Wait, optical telescopes can observe wavelengths from about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) up to infrared. So if the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, it's in the far UV. So to shift into the optical (visible), it's when lambda_obs is in 4000-7000 Angstroms.

Wait, so perhaps I should set lambda_obs >=4000 Angstroms. Let me recalculate.

Then, 1216*(1+z) >=4000

(1+z) >= 4000/1216 ≈3.29

z >= 2.29

So the minimum redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, C is 2.4 and D is 1.9. So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9, closer to 2.4. So the lower limit would be 2.29, so the minimum z is about 2.3, which would make it 2.4 in the options, option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the objects can be detected. So the lowest z where you can still detect it would be when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms, and the cloud is at z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). We need this to be >= 4000 Angstroms for optical. Wait, but 1216*(1+z) = 4000, so z=(4000/1216)-1 ≈ 3.29 -1= 2.29.

So the minimum z is about 2.29, so any z above that would have the Lyman alpha in the optical. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the options are C (2.4) and D (1.9). 2.29 is higher than D (1.9) and lower than C (2.4). So the options might not have exactly 2.29, but perhaps the question is looking for the minimal z where it's visible, so the minimal is 2.29 and the next higher option is 2.4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because another possibility is that the quasar's light is being absorbed, so maybe the quasar's emission itself is at a wavelength that's redshifted such that it's in the optical? No, wait, quasars emit across the spectrum, including optical. But the absorption is due to the hydrogen cloud's Lyman alpha.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the quasar's own emission. The quasar emits light across a broad spectrum, including the Lyman alpha emission line. But when the quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen at redshift z will absorb the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission, which is at 1216 Angstroms. So the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum would be at wavelength 1216*(1+z_cloud), where z_cloud is the redshift of the hydrogen cloud.

Wait, but the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar's light passes through it. So the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission (1216 A) would be absorbed by the cloud, creating a absorption line at 1216*(1+z_cloud) in the quasar's spectrum.

But the quasar's own light is at a certain redshift. Wait, no. If the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's redshift would be lower than the quasar's. So the absorption line would appear at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's spectrum, which is observed through the telescope.

Wait, but the problem states that the quasar is the background object, and the hydrogen cloud is in front of it. So the cloud is at some redshift z_cloud, which must be less than the quasar's redshift z_quasar.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects—so the cloud's redshift. Because the cloud's redshift determines where the Lyman alpha absorption appears in the quasar's spectrum.

But the key point is that the absorption line (at 1216*(1 + z_cloud)) must be in the observable range of the ground-based optical telescope. So if the absorption line is at a wavelength longer than the atmospheric cutoff (which is about 3000 Angstroms or 300 nm), then it's observable. So for the absorption line to be visible, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 3000 Angstroms.

So solving 1216*(1 + z) >= 3000:

1 + z >= 3000/1216 ≈2.4658

z >= 1.466. So the minimum z is about 1.466.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.466. Option B is 1.2, which is lower than 1.466, so it's not sufficient. So the lower limit on redshift z would be approximately 1.466, so any z >=1.466 would be detectable. Therefore, the minimal redshift is 1.466, so the lower limit is just above 1.466. Among the options, the closest higher one is D) 1.9, but perhaps the options are considering a different cutoff.

Wait, perhaps the cutoff is 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). Let me check again. If the cutoff is 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

So (1 + z) >=4000 /1216 ≈ 3.29. So z >= 2.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, which is not exactly any option. Option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29, so that would be the lower limit. But I'm getting conflicting possibilities based on the cutoff wavelength.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Lyman limit. The Lyman series for hydrogen has transitions ending at n=1. The Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. But when observed from the ground, any emission below about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) doesn't reach us because of atmospheric absorption. So for the Lyman-alpha line to be seen, it must have been redshifted beyond 3000 Angstroms.

So the equation again: 1216*(1+z) ≥ 3000.

z ≥ (3000/1216) - 1 ≈ 2.4658 -1 ≈1.4658. So z ≥1.466.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are B)1.2 and D)1.9. 1.466 is higher than B and lower than D. So if the lower limit is about 1.466, then any z above that would be detectable. So the minimal redshift is approximately 1.466, but none of the options exactly match. The closest higher option is D)1.9.

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So what's the minimal z where it can be detected. So we're looking for the smallest z where the observed wavelength is just entering the observable range (above 3000 A). So the minimal z is 1.466. So any cloud with z ≥1.466 can be detected.

But if the options don't include 1.466, then perhaps the correct approach is to pick the smallest option that is larger than 1.466. The options are B)1.2 (which is lower than 1.466) and D)1.9 (which is higher). So the minimal redshift is 1.466, so any z higher than that is detectable. So the lower limit is just above 1.466, so the minimal possible redshift is 1.466, and the answer options have D)1.9 as the next choice.

Wait, but the question says "estimate the lower limit". So what's the minimal z such that the object can be detected. So the minimal z is 1.466, and any higher z would also be detectable. So the lower limit is 1.466. But none of the options are exactly that. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's emission line is at a wavelength that is redshifted into the Lyman-alpha absorption line. Wait, no, that's probably complicating things. Let me think again. The quasar emits a broad spectrum, including its own Lyman alpha line. When the quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the cloud's hydrogen will absorb at its own Lyman alpha wavelength, which is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) in the observed frame. So the absorption line will be at that wavelength.

To see this absorption line, the observed wavelength must be in the optical, which is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000.

So 1 + z = 4000/1216 ≈3.29.

z ≈2.29.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4.

Wait, but according to this, the answer would be 2.29, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4, but that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, not 4000. Let me do that again.

If the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms:

1216*(1 + z) = 3000.

1 + z = 3000/1216 ≈2.4658.

z≈1.4658.

So the minimal z is about 1.466, so the lower limit is 1.466. The options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3.

So 1.466 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So the lower limit is 1.466, so any object with z >=1.466 can be detected. So the minimal z is approximately 1.466, so the lower limit is 1.466.

But the options don't have that. So the closest higher option is D)1.9.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is 1.466. So the clouds must have z >=1.466 to be detected. So the lower limit is z=1.466, which is approximately 1.47. So if the options have 1.9, that's higher than the minimal. But the question asks to estimate the lower limit, so the minimal is 1.466. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D)1.9, because 1.9 is the next available option above 1.466.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up the Lyman limit and the typical redshift calculations.

Wait, another approach: the Lyman-alpha forest refers to the absorption lines seen in quasar spectra due to intervening hydrogen clouds. These clouds have lower redshifts than the quasar. The Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at wavelengths longer than the quasar's emission line. Wait, no, the cloud's redshift affects where the absorption appears.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). For ground-based telescopes, which can't observe below ~300 nm (3000 Angstroms), the absorption must be redshifted beyond 3000 Angstroms. So, 1216*(1 + z) >=3000.

So z >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.4658 -1 =1.4658.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 1.466. So the lower limit is z=1.466, so any z >=1.466 will be detected.

Looking at options, D is 1.9, which is higher. So the answer must be D)1.9, as it's the smallest option that meets the condition. Wait, but wait, 1.466 is not an option. So which option is the minimal?

The options are:

A)3

B)1.2

C)2.4

D)1.9

So the minimal z is approximately 1.466. Among the options, the only higher option is D)1.9. So the lower limit is 1.466, so any cloud with z >=1.466 can be detected. Therefore, the lower limit is z=1.466, so the correct answer is the smallest option that is above this value. The options are B)1.2 (too low), D)1.9 (higher than 1.466), and C)2.4 (higher than 1.466).

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z where detection is possible. So which option represents the minimal z, perhaps the next higher option. So the answer would be D)1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to use a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the cloud's own emission isn't the point but the quasar's emission is redshifted. No, the question is about the Lyman alpha absorption by the cloud.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the quasar's rest frame. The quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud at redshift z causes the absorption at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. But for the absorption to be in the observed optical range, it needs to be longer than, say, 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

z >= (4000/1216)-1 ≈3.29 -1=2.29.

So minimal z is 2.29, which is not exactly an option. So the closest higher option is C)2.4.

But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than to 1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to use a different approach, like using the relation between redshift and distance, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the quasar's own light is redshifted into the optical, but that doesn't directly affect the absorption line's position, which is determined by the cloud's redshift.

Another angle: the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. For this line to be observed in the optical (say, 4000 Angstroms), the cloud must have a redshift z such that 1216*(1+z) =4000. Solving gives z= (4000/1216)-1≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

But looking at the options, another possibility is that the question is about the quasar's redshift, but that seems unlikely because the question says "large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space" are absorbing the quasar's light. So it's the cloud's redshift that matters.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the quasar's spectrum. The quasar emits at 1216 Angstroms (Lyman alpha), and if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, then the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength than the quasar's emission line. But I think the cloud is in front of the quasar, so its redshift is less than the quasar's.

Wait, but regardless, the calculation remains the same: the Lyman alpha absorption line's observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z_cloud). So for this to be in optical, z_cloud must be at least 1.466 (if cutoff is 3000 A) or 2.29 (if cutoff is 4000 A).

Since the options don't include 1.466 or 2.29, perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9, considering that the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms. Because 1.9 is higher than 1.466, and perhaps that's the minimal option given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to consider that the quasar's emission is in the UV, and the absorption occurs at a wavelength that can be seen in the optical.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think of the formula again.

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

We need lambda_obs to be above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) to be visible from the ground.

So 1216*(1 + z) >=3000.

z >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈(2.4658) -1=1.4658.

So the minimal z is about 1.466.

The options are B)1.2 (lower than 1.466) and D)1.9 (higher). So the correct lower limit is 1.466, but the next available option is D)1.9. So the minimal redshift would be approximately 1.466, making D)1.9 the correct answer since it's the next higher option provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to consider that the quasar's own light is redshifted into the optical, but I think that's not the case here. The cloud's redshift is what matters for the absorption line's position.

So, putting it all together, the minimal redshift is approximately 1.466. Among the options, D)1.9 is the next higher one. Therefore, the answer should be D)1.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift relationship. The Lyman alpha line has a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff, which is approximately \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \) (or \( 300 \, \text{nm} \)).

The redshift \( z \) is related to the observed wavelength by the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( z \):

\[
z \geq \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 3000 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
z \geq \frac{3000}{1216} - 1 \approx 2.4658 - 1 = 1.4658
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift is approximately \( z \approx 1.466 \). Among the given options, the closest higher value is \( z = 1.9 \). Lower values, such as \( z = 1.2 \), are insufficient for the absorption line to enter the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for detecting these objects is approximately \( z = 1.9 \), making it the correct choice.

Answer: D
