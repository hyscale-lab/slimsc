Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and under what conditions it's valid. Hmm, I remember the Mott-Gurney equation from my solid-state devices class. Let me think.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I think it's derived under certain assumptions about the device's operation. Let me recall... Oh right, the Mott-Gurney equation is for the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. So that implies that the current is limited by the space charge itself, not by things like ohmic resistance or other factors.

Wait, what are the key assumptions here? I think in the SCLC regime, the dominant mechanism is the field emission of electrons from the cathode, which is a trap-free process. So the device should be trap-free. Because if there are traps, then the current could be limited by trapping and detrapping, which would be a different regime, maybe the Shockley-Read-Hall effect or something else.

The equation also assumes that the device is single-carrier. Oh yeah, because if it were a two-carrier device (like a p-n junction where both electrons and holes are involved), the behavior might be different. Wait, but does the Mott-Gurney apply to two-carrier devices? Or is it only single-carrier? I think it's for single-carrier, like a diode with only electrons or holes conducting.

Also, I remember something about the contacts. Ohmic contacts versus Schottky contacts. Ohmic contacts have a low barrier, so the carriers can move freely. Schottky contacts have a higher barrier, which affects the injection. But in the Mott-Gurney equation, the derivation probably assumes that the contact is such that the injection is efficient and the electric field is mainly due to the space charge.

Wait, no, actually, the derivation for Mott-Gurney assumes that the device has an Ohmic contact. Because if it's a Schottky contact, the barrier would affect the electric field in a different way, perhaps leading to a different current dependence. Or maybe the presence of a Schottky barrier would complicate the space-charge distribution.

Another point: the derivation probably assumes negligible diffusion current. Because if diffusion is significant, then the current might not just be due to the electric field, but also due to concentration gradients. So the equation holds when the diffusion current is negligible, meaning the current is dominated by drift.

Wait, the equation is J proportional to V squared, which is what you get under SCLC conditions. So in that regime, the field is strong enough that the space charge creates a region where the electric field dominates the current transport, and the current is limited by the space charge itself.

So looking at the options:

Option A says trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Wait, no, the equation assumes that drift is the main component. Because if drift current is negligible, then maybe the equation wouldn't hold. Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the equation is about drift current being the dominant factor because it's based on the space-charge effect. So if drift is negligible, the Mott-Gurney equation wouldn't apply. So option A says negligible drift current. That might not be correct because Mott-Gurney applies when drift is the main thing, not when it's negligible. Wait, no, the options say "validity of the equation"—so what conditions are required for the equation to hold?

Alternatively, perhaps I got that backward. Let me think. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is space-charge limited, which implies that the space charge creates a field that limits the current. So in that case, the current is due to drift, and diffusion is negligible. So the equation holds when diffusion is negligible.

Wait, no, the SCLC (space-charge limited current) is when the current is limited by the space charge, which is a situation where the space charge's electric field affects the current. That would happen when the device is in a region where the current is due to the electric field, and not other things like ohmic resistance or diffusion. So the derivation probably assumes that the current is due to drift, and diffusion is negligible.

So the equation holds when the device has negligible diffusion current. So any option that says "negligible diffusion current" would be correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ...negligible drift current. That would not be correct because SCLC is about drift being dominant.

Wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. The diffusion current is related to the gradient in carrier concentration, whereas drift is due to the electric field.

In a SCLC situation, the dominant current is due to the electric field, which suggests drift current is dominant, and diffusion is negligible. So the equation is valid when diffusion is negligible.

Looking again:

Option A: trap-free single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. No, because if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion. Hmm. No injection barrier... Oh, that's about the contacts. If there's no injection barrier, that suggests Ohmic contact. Wait, but what about the contact's effect on the derivation?

Wait, Mott-Gurney equation is derived for a simple diode with an Ohmic contact. Because if it's a Schottky contact, the barrier would influence the space-charge profile differently, so the equation would differ. So the equation is valid when the contacts are Ohmic, which implies that the device allows for easy injection of carriers, so the barrier is low.

But wait, what about the statement in option B: "no carrier injection barrier." That suggests that the contacts are such that there's no barrier, which would imply an Ohmic contact. So that's correct.

Option B says trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (i.e., Ohmic), and negligible diffusion. So that would be correct because the equation is valid under these conditions.

But wait, option B says "no carrier injection barrier." That would imply that carriers can be injected without any energy barrier—so Ohmic. That's correct, because the Mott-Gurney equation is for a simple diode with Ohmic contacts, I think.

Option C: single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. If it's a Schottky contact, the barrier would change the space-charge distribution, so the equation would not hold. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: two-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier, so D is wrong.

So the correct option is B?

Wait, but let me think again. Option B says "no carrier injection barrier"—which is the same as Ohmic contact. So the equation applies to a single-carrier device with no injection barrier (Ohmic) and negligible diffusion.

Yes, that makes sense. Because if there's a Schottky barrier, you can't ignore the injection effects, so the equation would not apply. So the correct condition is that the device is trap-free, single-carrier, has no injection barrier (Ohmic), and negligible diffusion current.

The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current ($J$) versus voltage ($V$) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is derived under specific assumptions. The equation $J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$ assumes that the current is dominated by drift due to the electric field created by the space charge, and diffusion current is negligible. Additionally, the device must be single-carrier (not two-carrier), trap-free, and have efficient carrier injection, typically implied by Ohmic contacts (low injection barriers). Schottky contacts, which introduce significant barriers, would alter the space-charge distribution and invalidate the equation.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that drift current is dominant, not negligible. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, as it requires single-carrier operation, efficient injection (no barrier), and negligible diffusion current. This option is correct.

- **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts introduce barriers that affect the space-charge distribution, making the Mott-Gurney equation invalid. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current.
