Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through it.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light corresponds to an energy gap in the molecule, like between the HOMO and LUMO. Oh right, the energy of the emitted light is related to the energy difference between these molecular orbitals. But wait, do I emit the same energy as it absorbs? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes back, it emits a photon. But the energy of the emitted light depends on the energy transition. I think the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher than the energy of the emitted. Because absorption is usually a higher energy process, like from a lower energy state to a higher one, then when it drops back, it emits lower energy light.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed light must be higher than that. Because emission is when the molecule drops from an excited state to a lower state, releasing energy as light.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think. The energy of the photon emitted is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So if it's emitting 2.3393 eV, that's the energy gap. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of that photon must match the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, that's the same energy as the absorbed photon?

Wait, no, because emission and absorption are inverses. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. Because when the molecule absorbs it, it gets excited, then when it drops, it emits the same energy. Or wait, is that correct?

Hmm, maybe I should use the equation E = hc/λ. Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths.

Wait, visible light colors are in the order violet (highest energy), then blue, green, yellow, orange, red (lowest energy). The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I should convert that to wavelength to find out what color it is.

Wait, no, the question is about the color absorbed. Because the dye emits light of that energy, so it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Oh, wait, the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. So the color it emits is the complementary color of the absorbed. Because when something absorbs, say, blue, it emits the other colors, which when mixed appear as the complementary color.

Wait, but the question is about the color that's absorbed. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, what color is it absorbing?

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the photon emitted when it drops from an excited state to ground state. But the absorbed photon would have an energy equal to the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So the wavelength would correspond to the same energy.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when a molecule absorbs light, it's the energy that excites it, and the emitted light is when it relaxes. So they should be the same energy. But then why can't I just calculate the wavelength from 2.3393 eV and see its color?

So let's compute the wavelength. E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. E is 2.3393 eV, which is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = approximately 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm. Wait, 531 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, visible light is from about 400 (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 531 nm is green. So if the emitted light is green, then the absorbed must be green as well? Or wait, no, the molecule can't absorb and emit the same color. Because if it absorbs green, it would emit another color, but wait, no, that's not how it works.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, when a substance absorbs light, it doesn't necessarily emit the same color. For example, if a substance absorbs blue light, it might emit red. Or maybe it doesn't emit the same color. But in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the emitted light is usually lower energy than the absorbed. Because the molecule first absorbs a higher energy photon, gets excited, then emits a lower energy photon as it relaxes.

Wait, but in this case, the dye emits with a certain energy, which is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. To find the color absorbed, we need to think about the energy of the absorbed photon.

Wait, no. The absorbed photon's energy would be higher than the emitted. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it emits a photon, it comes down to a lower state, but not necessarily the ground state. So the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and the state it's dropping to.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this again.

The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is the energy of the photon absorbed. The energy of the emitted photon is (HOMO to LUMO energy difference) minus any energy lost as heat or other processes. Wait, but in the case of a simple transition, the emitted photon would have a lower energy than the absorbed.

But the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher than that.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So what color is that?

So let's calculate the wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s, E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = approx 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm. 

Looking at the visible spectrum, 531 nm is green. But wait, wait, no. Let me check. The visible spectrum is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). 531 nm is in the green range. Wait, no, 500 nm is green. Wait, 531 nm is actually blue-green, but perhaps closer to blue. Wait, no, actually, 450 nm is blue, 495 is cyan, 530 is green, 570 is yellow-green, 600 is orange, 700 is red.

Wait, 531 nm is just into the green region. So the emitted light is green. Then, if it's emitting green, that means it absorbed green? But that can't be right because that would imply it doesn't absorb any green. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when something emits a color, it's because it absorbed a complementary color.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing absorption and emission. Let me think: when a substance absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits others. So if a dye emits green light, it must have absorbed a different color—maybe blue or red? Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta.

Wait, let's think again. The color wheel: the complement of green is magenta. So if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed the magenta light. But magenta isn't an option here. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy. The emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. Let's see what that corresponds to in terms of wavelength. So 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green light. That implies that the dye absorbed green, and emitted green. That doesn't seem right. Because if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a molecule absorbs light, it's because the photon's energy matches the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. The energy of the absorbed photon is what excites the molecule. Then, when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy than the absorbed photon. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that, which would be blue or violet.

Wait, wait. Let's compute the energy for the absorbed photon. If the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, that's the energy difference between the excited state and the lower state. The absorbed photon would have higher energy, so let's compute what color that is.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap, which is the energy of the emitted photon. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, then emits a photon when it relaxes. But that would imply the same energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is the same as the absorbed. But that doesn't make sense because then the molecule wouldn't gain any energy. So it must have absorbed a higher energy photon.

Wait, maybe I should look up the conversion between eV and wavelength for colors. Let me think: I remember that 1 eV is about 1240 nm. So 2.3393 eV would be 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. So the dye is emitting green. So what color is it absorbing? Well, if it's emitting green, it must have absorbed something else. But wait, maybe the absorbed light is in the UV, which we can't see, but the emitted is in the visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed light, which may be in the visible range.

Wait, the question says: What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed light must have higher energy than that, meaning a shorter wavelength than green. So higher energy than green is blue or violet.

But the options given are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So green is in the middle. The absorbed color would be blue or violet.

But wait, the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than that. So the wavelength for the absorbed photon would be shorter than 531 nm. So 450 nm is blue, 400 is violet. So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

Which one is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV? Let me compute the energy for blue and violet.

Blue is around 450 nm. E = 1240 nm·eV / 450 nm ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet is around 400 nm. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

So both blue (2.756 eV) and violet (3.1 eV) have higher energy than the emitted green (2.339 eV). So the absorbed light could be either blue or violet.

But which one is the correct answer? The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Hmm, the question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy gap is 2.3393 eV, so the molecule absorbs light of this energy. Wait, no, because the emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the excited state and a lower state. So the absorbed photon's energy is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state, which is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

Wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon. If it emits a photon of the same energy, that would imply that the molecule didn't gain any energy. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

So the emitted is green (2.3393 eV) → absorbed is either blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV). So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So the absorbed light would be in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, both B and C are possible. But the question asks what color is absorbed. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the color of the absorbed light. If the dye emits green, it means it absorbed the complementary color, which would be magenta. But magenta isn't an option. So perhaps the absorbed light is in the blue or violet range.

Wait, but in reality, when a substance emits green light, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. Therefore, the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than green, so higher energy. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, the choices are B (violet) and C (blue). Which one has higher energy? Violet is higher. So the absorbed light would be violet if the energy is higher than green.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits green light. So the absorbed light has higher energy, which is violet.

Wait, but wait. If the dye emits green, then the absorbed light would have to be the complementary color, which is magenta. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking about the absorption of the same energy as emitted. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait another thought: the energy of the photon emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the photon absorbed should be the same as this since the energy difference between the orbitals is that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from HOMO to LUMO, which requires energy E. When it emits a photon, the electron drops back, releasing energy E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy.

Wait, that would mean the absorbed light is also 2.3393 eV, which is green. But the options don't have green as an option. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, so this seems conflicting. So perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength to find the color.

E = hc/lambda → lambda = hc / E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s, E =2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = approx 3.745e-19 J.

Lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.745e-19 → (1.9878e-25) / 3.745e-19 = approx 5.31e-7 meters = 531 nm. 531 nm is in the green region. So the emitted light is green.

So the dye emits green light. Therefore, it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy. Because when it absorbs a photon, it excites to a higher state, then emits a photon when it relaxes.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So it's in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, B is Violet (higher energy than blue), C is Blue.

So which one is correct? Let me think about the energy.

If the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So for example, if the absorbed photon is blue (say, 2.75 eV), then the emitted photon's energy would be 2.75 - (some energy loss) ≈ 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon would be blue. Alternatively, if the absorbed is violet (3.1 eV), the emitted would be 3.1 - loss ≈ 2.3393 → loss of 0.76 eV, which is quite a lot. But it's possible.

But without knowing the exact energy loss, it's hard to tell whether the absorbed photon is blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed?

If the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed color is either violet or blue. So the possible options are B or C.

But the question expects a single answer, so perhaps I should think about typical dyes. For example, when a dye absorbs in the blue region, it emits yellow. Or when it absorbs in the violet, it emits yellow as well.

Wait, but in the case of chlorophyll, it absorbs blue and red, emits yellow-green. But this is a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be complementary to green, which is magenta. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the absorption of the same energy, which would imply the dye is absorbing green, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the correct approach is that the dye emits green, so it's absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta. But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question is implying that the absorbed photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. But the options don't have green.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength. Let me recalculate.

E = 2.3393 eV → convert to Joules: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = approx 3.745e-19 J.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s.

lambda = hc / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.745e-19 → (1.9878e-25) / 3.745e-19 = approx 5.31e-7 meters = 531 nm.

Yes, that's correct. 531 nm is green.

So the emitted light is green. So the absorbed light must be of higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength.

So the absorbed light is either blue (450 nm, ~2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, ~3.1 eV).

The question is, which color is among the options. The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So both B and C are possible. But the question is asking which color is absorbed. So the emitted is green, which is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed must be higher.

So the options are either B or C. Let me think: If the emitted is green, the absorbed would be blue or violet. But which one is more likely?

Wait, another approach. The energy of the absorbed photon is the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap. Wait, but that can't be because if the molecule absorbs a photon and then emits it, then the energy would be the same. But that would imply that the molecule didn't gain any energy, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon only in the case of a two-level system where the molecule absorbs and emits the same energy. But in reality, molecules have more complex transitions and often lose some energy as heat, so the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so blue or violet. Then, the question becomes, which of these options is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, let's compute the energy for each color.

Option B: Violet is around 400 nm. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue is around 450 nm. E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the question is what color is absorbed. So possible options are B and C.

Wait, but in the options, only one is correct. Maybe the correct answer is blue because it's closer in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the wavelength calculated is 531 nm, which is green. The complementary color is magenta, which is not an option. So the other approach is considering that the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, maybe the question is about the color absorbed, not the emitted. The question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light must have higher energy.

So the question is, what color is absorbed, which is either violet or blue.

Looking at the options, B is Violet, and C is Blue.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is violet because it's a higher energy than blue, so the absorbed photon is violet.

Wait, but wait, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon is higher, so it's either blue or violet. But the question is, which color is it.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO. So if a molecule emits a photon of energy E, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than E.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

Thus, the possible colors are Violet (3.1 eV) and Blue (2.75 eV), which are both higher. So the correct answer would be either B or C.

But the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and the correct answer is one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is the opposite: since the molecule emits green, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet region.

But without more information, it's hard to decide between B and C. So perhaps I should think about the colors that are more likely to be absorbed for a conjugated system.

Extensively conjugated pi-electrons typically absorb in the visible range, but where exactly depends on the conjugation length. Longer conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption.

Wait, but wait, the longer the conjugation, the lower the energy of the absorbed photon. Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength.

So if the molecule has extensive conjugation, it would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region. For example, something with a large conjugated system might absorb in the red or near-infrared. But wait, that's for the absorption. So if the dye absorbs in the red, it would emit in the green.

Wait, but in this question, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), which suggests that the absorbed photon is higher energy than that, so blue or violet.

But for a large conjugated system, the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy). So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption would be in the red or even longer. But that would mean the emitted light is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, but in that case, the emitted light would be in the IR, not the visible. But the question says the emitted light is in the visible (2.3393 eV is green), so the absorption must be in the visible as well.

So, the molecule has an extensive conjugated system, but it still absorbs in the visible. So for a large conjugated system, the absorption would be in the red (lower energy). But if the emitted photon is green, the absorption must be higher energy than that.

So, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet range.

But the question is, which one of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the emitted photon is green (531 nm), so the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet. But the question is, which color is absorbed.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). So which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, but the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as emitted. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should just look up the energy levels. The energy of visible light in eV: violet is about 3 eV, blue about 2.7 eV, green about 2.3 eV, yellow about 2 eV, orange about 1.8 eV, red about 1.7 eV.

Wait, so if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green, then the absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so blue or violet.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is in the blue or violet range. So the possible options are B and C.

But the question is, which is it?

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is, say, 2.75 eV (blue) or 3.1 eV (violet).

The question is, which color is absorbed. So the options are B and C.

But without additional information, I can't decide. So perhaps the correct approach is to look at the options.

Wait, if the dye is emitting green, the absorbed light must be of higher energy. So if the choices are violet (B) or blue (C), both are possible.

But the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy absorption (longer wavelength). So the absorption would be in the red or near-infrared.

Wait, but that would mean the emitted photon is even lower in energy. Wait, but the question says the emitted is green. So perhaps the absorption is in the blue or violet.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe it's better to think that the emitted light is green, which would mean the absorbed light is blue or violet. Since the options are B and C, and the question expects one answer, I think it's more likely that the absorbed color is blue.

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and then emits a photon of the same energy when it relaxes. That would mean the absorbed photon is green, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's asking for the emitted color, not the absorbed. But the question states the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so what color is absorbed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so either blue or violet. So the correct answer is the one with higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So, since violet is higher in energy than blue, the absorbed photon is violet.

But wait, another way: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So the absorbed photon is green. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed light, which is the same as the emitted. But that doesn't make sense. Because if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed a different color.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not considering that the emitted light is due to fluorescence, which usually has lower energy than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the color of the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

So, given that the options are B and C, and the question asks which color is absorbed, I think the correct answer is either B or C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example. For instance, a dye that emits green light when excited by blue light. So the absorbed light is blue, and emitted is green.

So in this case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed would be blue (2.75 eV).

So the answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, if the absorbed is violet, the emitted would be violet minus some energy. But 3.1 eV is higher than 2.3393, so the emitted could be 2.3393 eV if all the extra energy is lost. But that's possible.

But without knowing the exact energy loss, it's hard to say. But since blue is higher than green, and the question is about absorption, I think the correct answer is C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. The energy of the emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the dye. Since the emitted photon has an energy of 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than this, as the molecule gains energy when absorbing light and loses some energy (e.g., as heat or during relaxation) when emitting light.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Energy to Wavelength Conversion**:  
   Using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), the wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{2.3393 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 531 \, \text{nm}.
   \]  
   This places the emitted light in the green region of the visible spectrum.

2. **Energy of Absorbed Light**:  
   The absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon. The energy of light is inversely proportional to its wavelength, so the absorbed photon corresponds to a shorter wavelength than 531 nm.  
   - Violet light (~400 nm) corresponds to \( E \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).  
   - Blue light (~450 nm) corresponds to \( E \approx 2.756 \, \text{eV} \).  

   Both violet and blue are higher in energy than green (2.3393 eV), so the absorbed light could be either violet or blue.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) Red**: Red light has a lower energy than green (around 1.7–1.8 eV), so it cannot be the absorbed light.  
   - **B) Violet**: Violet light has higher energy than green (around 3.1 eV), making it a possible candidate for the absorbed light.  
   - **C) Blue**: Blue light has higher energy than green (around 2.756 eV), making it another possible candidate for the absorbed light.  
   - **D) Yellow**: Yellow light has lower energy than green (around 2.0 eV), so it cannot be the absorbed light.

4. **Final Consideration**:  
   Both violet and blue are plausible candidates for the absorbed light. However, the question specifies that the dye has an extensively conjugated π-electron system. Extensive conjugation typically shifts the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy), suggesting that the absorbed light is closer in energy to the emitted green light. Blue light (2.756 eV) is closer in energy to green (2.3393 eV) than violet light (3.1 eV), making blue the more likely absorbed light.

### Conclusion:
The absorbed light is blue. 

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through it.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light corresponds to an energy gap in the molecule, like between the HOMO and LUMO. Oh right, the energy of the emitted light is related to the energy difference between these molecular orbitals. But wait, do I emit the same energy as it absorbs? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes back, it emits a photon. But the energy of the emitted light depends on the energy transition. I think the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher than the energy of the emitted. Because absorption is usually a higher energy process, like from a lower energy state to a higher one, then when it drops back, it emits lower energy light.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed light must be higher than that. Because emission is when the molecule drops from an excited state to a lower state, releasing energy as light.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think. The energy of the photon emitted is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So if it's emitting 2.3393 eV, that's the energy gap. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of that photon must match the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, that's the same energy as the absorbed photon?

Wait, no, because emission and absorption are inverses. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. Because when the molecule absorbs it, it gets excited, then when it drops, it emits the same energy. Or wait, is that correct?

Hmm, maybe I should use the equation E = hc/λ. Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths.

Wait, visible light colors are in the order violet (highest energy), then blue, green, yellow, orange, red (lowest energy). The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I should convert that to wavelength to find out what color it is.

Wait, no, the question is about the color absorbed. Because the dye emits light of that energy, so it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Oh, wait, the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. So the color it emits is the complementary color of the absorbed. Because when something absorbs, say, blue, it emits the other colors, which when mixed appear as the complementary color.

Wait, but the question is about the color that's absorbed. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, what color is it absorbing?

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the photon emitted when it drops from an excited state to ground state. But the absorbed photon would have an energy equal to the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So the wavelength would correspond to the same energy.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when a molecule absorbs light, it's the energy that excites it, and the emitted light is when it relaxes. So they should be the same energy. But then why can't I just calculate the wavelength from 2.3393 eV and see its color?

So let's compute the wavelength. E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. E is 2.3393 eV, which is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = approximately 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm. Wait, 531 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, visible light is from about 400 (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 531 nm is green. So if the emitted light is green, then the absorbed must be green as well? Or wait, no, the molecule can't absorb and emit the same color. Because if it absorbs green, it would emit another color, but wait, no, that's not how it works.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, when a substance absorbs light, it doesn't necessarily emit the same color. For example, if a substance absorbs blue light, it might emit red. Or maybe it doesn't emit the same color. But in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the emitted light is usually lower energy than the absorbed. Because the molecule first absorbs a higher energy photon, gets excited, then emits a lower energy photon as it relaxes.

Wait, but in this case, the dye emits with a certain energy, which is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. To find the color absorbed, we need to think about the energy of the absorbed photon.

Wait, no. The absorbed photon's energy would be higher than the emitted. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it emits a photon, it comes down to a lower state, but not necessarily the ground state. So the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and the state it's dropping to.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this again.

The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is the energy of the photon absorbed. The energy of the emitted photon is (HOMO to LUMO energy difference) minus any energy lost as heat or other processes. Wait, but in the case of a simple transition, the emitted photon would have a lower energy than the absorbed.

But the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher than that.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So what color is that?

So let's calculate the wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s, E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = approx 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm. 

Looking at the visible spectrum, 531 nm is green. But wait, wait, no. Let me check. The visible spectrum is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). 531 nm is in the green range. Wait, no, 500 nm is green. Wait, 531 nm is actually blue-green, but perhaps closer to blue. Wait, no, actually, 450 nm is blue, 495 is cyan, 530 is green, 570 is yellow-green, 600 is orange, 700 is red.

Wait, 531 nm is just into the green region. So the emitted light is green. Then, if it's emitting green, that means it absorbed green? But that can't be right because that would imply it doesn't absorb any green. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when something emits a color, it's because it absorbed a complementary color.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing absorption and emission. Let me think: when a substance absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits others. So if a dye emits green light, it must have absorbed a different color—maybe blue or red? Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta.

Wait, let's think again. The color wheel: the complement of green is magenta. So if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed the magenta light. But magenta isn't an option here. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy. The emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. Let's see what that corresponds to in terms of wavelength. So 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green light. That implies that the dye absorbed green, and emitted green. That doesn't seem right. Because if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a molecule absorbs light, it's because the photon's energy matches the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. The energy of the absorbed photon is what excites the molecule. Then, when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy than the absorbed photon. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that, which would be blue or violet.

Wait, wait. Let's compute the energy for the absorbed photon. If the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, that's the energy difference between the excited state and the lower state. The absorbed photon would have higher energy, so let's compute what color that is.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap, which is the energy of the emitted photon. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, then emits a photon when it relaxes. But that would imply the same energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is the same as the absorbed. But that doesn't make sense because then the molecule wouldn't gain any energy. So it must have absorbed a higher energy photon.

Wait, maybe I should look up the conversion between eV and wavelength for colors. Let me think: I remember that 1 eV is about 1240 nm. So 2.3393 eV would be 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. So the dye is emitting green. So what color is it absorbing? Well, if it's emitting green, it must have absorbed something else. But wait, maybe the absorbed light is in the UV, which we can't see, but the emitted is in the visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed light, which may be in the visible range.

Wait, the question says: What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed light must have higher energy than that, meaning a shorter wavelength than green. So higher energy than green is blue or violet.

But the options given are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So green is in the middle. The absorbed color would be blue or violet.

But wait, the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than that. So the wavelength for the absorbed photon would be shorter than 531 nm. So 450 nm is blue, 400 is violet. So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

Which one is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV? Let me compute the energy for blue and violet.

Blue is around 450 nm. E = 1240 nm·eV / 450 nm ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet is around 400 nm. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

So both blue (2.756 eV) and violet (3.1 eV) have higher energy than the emitted green (2.339 eV). So the absorbed light could be either blue or violet.

But which one is the correct answer? The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Hmm, the question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy gap is 2.3393 eV, so the molecule absorbs light of this energy. Wait, no, because the emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the excited state and a lower state. So the absorbed photon's energy is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state, which is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

Wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon. If it emits a photon of the same energy, that would imply that the molecule didn't gain any energy. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

So the emitted is green (2.3393 eV) → absorbed is either blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV). So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So the absorbed light would be in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, both B and C are possible. But the question asks what color is absorbed. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the color of the absorbed light. If the dye emits green, it means it absorbed the complementary color, which would be magenta. But magenta isn't an option. So perhaps the absorbed light is in the blue or violet range.

Wait, but in reality, when a substance emits green light, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. Therefore, the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than green, so higher energy. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, the choices are B (violet) and C (blue). Which one has higher energy? Violet is higher. So the absorbed light would be violet if the energy is higher than green.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits green light. So the absorbed light has higher energy, which is violet.

Wait, but wait. If the dye emits green, then the absorbed light would have to be the complementary color, which is magenta. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking about the absorption of the same energy as emitted. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait another thought: the energy of the photon emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the photon absorbed should be the same as this since the energy difference between the orbitals is that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from HOMO to LUMO, which requires energy E. When it emits a photon, the electron drops back, releasing energy E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy.

Wait, that would mean the absorbed light is also 2.3393 eV, which is green. But the options don't have green as an option. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, so this seems conflicting. So perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength to find the color.

E = hc/lambda → lambda = hc / E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s, E =2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = approx 3.745e-19 J.

Lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.745e-19 → (1.9878e-25) / 3.745e-19 = approx 5.31e-7 meters = 531 nm. 531 nm is in the green region. So the emitted light is green.

So the dye emits green light. Therefore, it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy. Because when it absorbs a photon, it excites to a higher state, then emits a photon when it relaxes.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So it's in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, B is Violet (higher energy than blue), C is Blue.

So which one is correct? Let me think about the energy.

If the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So for example, if the absorbed photon is blue (say, 2.75 eV), then the emitted photon's energy would be 2.75 - (some energy loss) ≈ 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon would be blue. Alternatively, if the absorbed is violet (3.1 eV), the emitted would be 3.1 - loss ≈ 2.3393 → loss of 0.76 eV, which is quite a lot. But it's possible.

But without knowing the exact energy loss, it's hard to tell whether the absorbed photon is blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed?

If the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed color is either violet or blue. So the possible options are B or C.

But the question expects a single answer, so perhaps I should think about typical dyes. For example, when a dye absorbs in the blue region, it emits yellow. Or when it absorbs in the violet, it emits yellow as well.

Wait, but in the case of chlorophyll, it absorbs blue and red, emits yellow-green. But this is a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be complementary to green, which is magenta. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the absorption of the same energy, which would imply the dye is absorbing green, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the correct approach is that the dye emits green, so it's absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta. But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question is implying that the absorbed photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. But the options don't have green.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength. Let me recalculate.

E = 2.3393 eV → convert to Joules: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = approx 3.745e-19 J.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s.

lambda = hc / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.745e-19 → (1.9878e-25) / 3.745e-19 = approx 5.31e-7 meters = 531 nm.

Yes, that's correct. 531 nm is green.

So the emitted light is green. So the absorbed light must be of higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength.

So the absorbed light is either blue (450 nm, ~2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, ~3.1 eV).

The question is, which color is among the options. The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So both B and C are possible. But the question is asking which color is absorbed. So the emitted is green, which is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed must be higher.

So the options are either B or C. Let me think: If the emitted is green, the absorbed would be blue or violet. But which one is more likely?

Wait, another approach. The energy of the absorbed photon is the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap. Wait, but that can't be because if the molecule absorbs a photon and then emits it, then the energy would be the same. But that would imply that the molecule didn't gain any energy, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon only in the case of a two-level system where the molecule absorbs and emits the same energy. But in reality, molecules have more complex transitions and often lose some energy as heat, so the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so blue or violet. Then, the question becomes, which of these options is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, let's compute the energy for each color.

Option B: Violet is around 400 nm. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue is around 450 nm. E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the question is what color is absorbed. So possible options are B and C.

Wait, but in the options, only one is correct. Maybe the correct answer is blue because it's closer in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the wavelength calculated is 531 nm, which is green. The complementary color is magenta, which is not an option. So the other approach is considering that the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, maybe the question is about the color absorbed, not the emitted. The question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light must have higher energy.

So the question is, what color is absorbed, which is either violet or blue.

Looking at the options, B is Violet, and C is Blue.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is violet because it's a higher energy than blue, so the absorbed photon is violet.

Wait, but wait, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon is higher, so it's either blue or violet. But the question is, which color is it.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO. So if a molecule emits a photon of energy E, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than E.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

Thus, the possible colors are Violet (3.1 eV) and Blue (2.75 eV), which are both higher. So the correct answer would be either B or C.

But the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and the correct answer is one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is the opposite: since the molecule emits green, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet region.

But without more information, it's hard to decide between B and C. So perhaps I should think about the colors that are more likely to be absorbed for a conjugated system.

Extensively conjugated pi-electrons typically absorb in the visible range, but where exactly depends on the conjugation length. Longer conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption.

Wait, but wait, the longer the conjugation, the lower the energy of the absorbed photon. Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength.

So if the molecule has extensive conjugation, it would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region. For example, something with a large conjugated system might absorb in the red or near-infrared. But wait, that's for the absorption. So if the dye absorbs in the red, it would emit in the green.

Wait, but in this question, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), which suggests that the absorbed photon is higher energy than that, so blue or violet.

But for a large conjugated system, the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy). So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption would be in the red or even longer. But that would mean the emitted light is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, but in that case, the emitted light would be in the IR, not the visible. But the question says the emitted light is in the visible (2.3393 eV is green), so the absorption must be in the visible as well.

So, the molecule has an extensive conjugated system, but it still absorbs in the visible. So for a large conjugated system, the absorption would be in the red (lower energy). But if the emitted photon is green, the absorption must be higher energy than that.

So, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet range.

But the question is, which one of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the emitted photon is green (531 nm), so the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet. But the question is, which color is absorbed.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). So which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, but the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as emitted. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should just look up the energy levels. The energy of visible light in eV: violet is about 3 eV, blue about 2.7 eV, green about 2.3 eV, yellow about 2 eV, orange about 1.8 eV, red about 1.7 eV.

Wait, so if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green, then the absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so blue or violet.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is in the blue or violet range. So the possible options are B and C.

But the question is, which is it?

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is, say, 2.75 eV (blue) or 3.1 eV (violet).

The question is, which color is absorbed. So the options are B and C.

But without additional information, I can't decide. So perhaps the correct approach is to look at the options.

Wait, if the dye is emitting green, the absorbed light must be of higher energy. So if the choices are violet (B) or blue (C), both are possible.

But the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy absorption (longer wavelength). So the absorption would be in the red or near-infrared.

Wait, but that would mean the emitted photon is even lower in energy. Wait, but the question says the emitted is green. So perhaps the absorption is in the blue or violet.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe it's better to think that the emitted light is green, which would mean the absorbed light is blue or violet. Since the options are B and C, and the question expects one answer, I think it's more likely that the absorbed color is blue.

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and then emits a photon of the same energy when it relaxes. That would mean the absorbed photon is green, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's asking for the emitted color, not the absorbed. But the question states the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so what color is absorbed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so either blue or violet. So the correct answer is the one with higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So, since violet is higher in energy than blue, the absorbed photon is violet.

But wait, another way: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So the absorbed photon is green. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed light, which is the same as the emitted. But that doesn't make sense. Because if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed a different color.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not considering that the emitted light is due to fluorescence, which usually has lower energy than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the color of the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

So, given that the options are B and C, and the question asks which color is absorbed, I think the correct answer is either B or C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example. For instance, a dye that emits green light when excited by blue light. So the absorbed light is blue, and emitted is green.

So in this case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed would be blue (2.75 eV).

So the answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, if the absorbed is violet, the emitted would be violet minus some energy. But 3.1 eV is higher than 2.3393, so the emitted could be 2.3393 eV if all the extra energy is lost. But that's possible.

But without knowing the exact energy loss, it's hard to say. But since blue is higher than green, and the question is about absorption, I think the correct answer is C) Blue.


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. The energy of the emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the dye. Since the emitted photon has an energy of 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than this, as the molecule gains energy when absorbing light and loses some energy (e.g., as heat or during relaxation) when emitting light.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Energy to Wavelength Conversion**:  
   Using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), the wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{2.3393 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 531 \, \text{nm}.
   \]  
   This places the emitted light in the green region of the visible spectrum.

2. **Energy of Absorbed Light**:  
   The absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon. The energy of light is inversely proportional to its wavelength, so the absorbed photon corresponds to a shorter wavelength than 531 nm.  
   - Violet light (~400 nm) corresponds to \( E \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).  
   - Blue light (~450 nm) corresponds to \( E \approx 2.756 \, \text{eV} \).  

   Both violet and blue are higher in energy than green (2.3393 eV), so the absorbed light could be either violet or blue.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) Red**: Red light has a lower energy than green (around 1.7–1.8 eV), so it cannot be the absorbed light.  
   - **B) Violet**: Violet light has higher energy than green (around 3.1 eV), making it a possible candidate for the absorbed light.  
   - **C) Blue**: Blue light has higher energy than green (around 2.756 eV), making it another possible candidate for the absorbed light.  
   - **D) Yellow**: Yellow light has lower energy than green (around 2.0 eV), so it cannot be the absorbed light.

4. **Final Consideration**:  
   Both violet and blue are plausible candidates for the absorbed light. However, the question specifies that the dye has an extensively conjugated π-electron system. Extensive conjugation typically shifts the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy), suggesting that the absorbed light is closer in energy to the emitted green light. Blue light (2.756 eV) is closer in energy to green (2.3393 eV) than violet light (3.1 eV), making blue the more likely absorbed light.

### Conclusion:
The absorbed light is blue.
