Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons in total. Hmm, but wait, substituents can have more than one carbon each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total is 8 carbons in the compound. So benzene (6) plus substituents (2), so substituents have 2 carbons together. That makes sense.

So the FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl or Ar-Br). Oh, so two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. But wait, the substituents must be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Or wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl, and the other is a halogen. But wait, substituents on the benzene ring usually are single groups. So if it's di-substituted, there are two substituents, each connected to the ring.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So each substituent could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), making it a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Let's see: benzene (6) plus two substituents. Let's think about possible substituents.

If one substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br, that's just a single atom, so it doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent would have to be something else that adds two carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 0 (halogen) + 2 (other substituent) = 8. So the other substituent would have two carbons. So what's a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group?

Ah, maybe an acetyl group (CH2CO-?), but wait, benzene is connected to a carbonyl group. So perhaps one substituent is an acetyl group (like -COCH3?), but wait, that's two carbons: the CO is one, and the methyl is another? Wait, no: acetyl is O=C-CH3. So that's two carbons in the substituent (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl). So benzene has two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is an acetyl group.

Wait, but wait. Let me count: benzene (6) + Cl (0 carbons) + COCH3 (2 carbons, because CO is one and CH3 is another, but wait, COCH3 is an acetyl group which is O=C-CH3. So that's one substituent with two carbons (the methyl group is part of the substituent, so the substituent is two carbons in total: the carbonyl (C=O) and the adjacent CH3). So yes, that would make 6 + 0 + 2 = 8 carbons.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a formyl group (CHO), which is one carbon. But that would only add 1 carbon, so the other substituent would have to be one carbon, but halogens are zero. So perhaps another substituent is a methyl group, but that would make the total substituent carbons 1 + 0 =1, which doesn't add up to 8. So the first scenario is more likely: one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), and the other is a two-carbon group, such as an acetyl group.

But wait, another possibility is that one substituent is a ketone, like a carbonyl attached to the ring. So, for example, benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, but that's only one carbon. No, wait, benzaldehyde is Ph-CHO, so the substituent is CHO (one carbon). But then the other substituent would need to be a two-carbon group, like an ethyl group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group, so the substituent must have a C=O. So, for the substituents, one is a C=O-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

So substituent 1: -X (X is Cl, Br, etc.), which doesn't add any carbons. Substituent 2: something with a carbonyl group and two carbons. So substituent 2 could be an acetyl group, as I thought earlier. So substituent 2 is O=C-CH3. But wait, that's a ketone, so it's an acetophenone group.

Wait, let me count the carbons again. Benzene (6 carbons) + substituent 1 (Cl: 0) + substituent 2 (acetyl: 2 carbons) â†’ total 6 + 0 + 2 = 8. Yeah, that works.

So the structure would be 1-chloro-3-acetylbenzene, for example. Alternatively, the substituents could be in any positions, but since it's di-substituted, the positions matter for the NMR.

Now, looking at the options, we need to find the NMR that matches this structure. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm. The singlet at 9.9 is probably a carbonyl adjacent proton, like an aldehyde. But wait, the substituent is an acetyl group, which is a ketone. Aldehydes have protons, but ketones don't. So maybe this is an aldehyde group, but that would require substituent 2 to be CHO, which is only one carbon. Wait, but earlier, we thought substituent 2 is two carbons. So maybe substituent 2 is not an acetyl group. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an aldehyde and another group. Hmm, but earlier, substituent 2 would need to be two carbons. So perhaps this option is not correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). This looks like a di-substituted group, maybe ethylene glycol or something, but I don't see aromatic protons here. Since the compound is an aromatic ring with two substituents, we should expect aromatic protons in the NMR. Option B doesn't show any aromatic peaks, so I think this is incorrect.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons look like a pair of doublets, which suggests a para-substituted pattern for the substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is likely a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, like a carbonyl. So, for example, an acetyl group (O=C-CH3) would have a singlet at around 2.1-2.3 ppm for the methyl. So this could fit. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. But wait, where are they positioned? If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. So if the ring has Cl and COCH3 at para positions, the remaining two sets of protons would each be a pair of doublets. So the aromatic H NMR would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the 7.8 and 7.6 ppm peaks. And the 2.3 ppm is the methyl group. So this option looks promising.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aromatic proton if there's a substituent causing symmetry. But if the substituents are in the meta positions, perhaps leading to a single proton. But I'm not sure. The other peaks look like they're from an ethylene group, maybe an ethyl group attached to something else. But again, without aromatic protons, this doesn't fit. Wait, no, the 6.9 is an aromatic proton. So if there's a substituent in the para position, and another substituent perhaps next to it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substituent. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The compound has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and the other is a halogen (like Cl).

If the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern. For example, if one substituent is at position 1 and the other at position 3 (if 1,3-disubstituted), but wait, that's not para. Para would be positions 1 and 4. So in that case, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. Then, the remaining protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the protons adjacent to each substituent would be in positions 2 and 6 for substituent 1, and positions 3 and 5 for substituent 4. So the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is what option C shows.

So the aromatic protons in C are two doublets (2H each) at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That fits the scenario of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. So that would be the structure.

But wait, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So if the substituents are para, then the carbonyl and halogen are opposite each other. So the NMR would show aromatic protons as two doublets, which is what option C has.

But let me check option C again. The substituent would be Cl and COCH3 in para positions. Then, the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to each substituent. Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 4, the protons adjacent would be at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1), and at 3 and 5 (meta to substituent 4, which is para to substituent 1). So those protons would each couple with their adjacent substituents. But in this case, the two substituents are both deactivating (Cl is meta director, COCH3 is a strong deactivating group). So the NMR would show each set of protons as doublets.

So in the NMR, the four aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets. The upfield and downfield shifts would depend on the substituents. The protons ortho to the carbonyl (which is a strong deactivating group) would be more downfield. The protons ortho to the Cl would also be deshielded and appear downfield, but perhaps not as much as those near the carbonyl.

Wait, but in option C, the two doublets are at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That suggests that each pair is downfield, which makes sense with substituents that are deactivating. The methyl group at 2.3 ppm is consistent with an acetyl group.

So option C seems correct. But let me look back at the options. Option C's NMR shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). So that's four aromatic protons and a methyl. Benzene has six protons, so two substituents would make four aromatic protons. So that fits.

But wait, the carbonyl group is part of the substituent. So if the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then yes, that would give two substituents. So the structure would be para-chloroacetophenone, I think. Then, the NMR would match option C.

Wait, but another possibility: what if the substituent is an acetyl group and a methyl group? No, because the IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the correct NMR would be option C.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since benzene contributes 6 carbons, the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (e.g., Ar-X, where X is Cl or Br). This suggests one substituent is a halogen (0 carbons) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, likely an acetyl group (-COCH3, 2 carbons). Thus, the structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituents -Cl and -COCH3.

The NMR spectrum must reflect this structure. The aromatic protons will appear as two doublets (2H each) due to the para-substitution pattern, with the protons ortho to the carbonyl group being more deshielded and appearing downfield. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the acetyl group. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lacks aromatic protons, which are expected for an aromatic compound. Incorrect.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group, matching the expected pattern for para-chloroacetophenone. Correct.
- **Option D**: Includes peaks characteristic of an ethylene group, which are not present in the compound. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons in total. Hmm, but wait, substituents can have more than one carbon each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total is 8 carbons in the compound. So benzene (6) plus substituents (2), so substituents have 2 carbons together. That makes sense.

So the FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl or Ar-Br). Oh, so two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. But wait, the substituents must be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Or wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl, and the other is a halogen. But wait, substituents on the benzene ring usually are single groups. So if it's di-substituted, there are two substituents, each connected to the ring.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So each substituent could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), making it a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Let's see: benzene (6) plus two substituents. Let's think about possible substituents.

If one substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br, that's just a single atom, so it doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent would have to be something else that adds two carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 0 (halogen) + 2 (other substituent) = 8. So the other substituent would have two carbons. So what's a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group?

Ah, maybe an acetyl group (CH2CO-?), but wait, benzene is connected to a carbonyl group. So perhaps one substituent is an acetyl group (like -COCH3?), but wait, that's two carbons: the CO is one, and the methyl is another? Wait, no: acetyl is O=C-CH3. So that's two carbons in the substituent (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl). So benzene has two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is an acetyl group.

Wait, but wait. Let me count: benzene (6) + Cl (0 carbons) + COCH3 (2 carbons, because CO is one and CH3 is another, but wait, COCH3 is an acetyl group which is O=C-CH3. So that's one substituent with two carbons (the methyl group is part of the substituent, so the substituent is two carbons in total: the carbonyl (C=O) and the adjacent CH3). So yes, that would make 6 + 0 + 2 = 8 carbons.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a formyl group (CHO), which is one carbon. But that would only add 1 carbon, so the other substituent would have to be one carbon, but halogens are zero. So perhaps another substituent is a methyl group, but that would make the total substituent carbons 1 + 0 =1, which doesn't add up to 8. So the first scenario is more likely: one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), and the other is a two-carbon group, such as an acetyl group.

But wait, another possibility is that one substituent is a ketone, like a carbonyl attached to the ring. So, for example, benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, but that's only one carbon. No, wait, benzaldehyde is Ph-CHO, so the substituent is CHO (one carbon). But then the other substituent would need to be a two-carbon group, like an ethyl group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group, so the substituent must have a C=O. So, for the substituents, one is a C=O-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

So substituent 1: -X (X is Cl, Br, etc.), which doesn't add any carbons. Substituent 2: something with a carbonyl group and two carbons. So substituent 2 could be an acetyl group, as I thought earlier. So substituent 2 is O=C-CH3. But wait, that's a ketone, so it's an acetophenone group.

Wait, let me count the carbons again. Benzene (6 carbons) + substituent 1 (Cl: 0) + substituent 2 (acetyl: 2 carbons) â†’ total 6 + 0 + 2 = 8. Yeah, that works.

So the structure would be 1-chloro-3-acetylbenzene, for example. Alternatively, the substituents could be in any positions, but since it's di-substituted, the positions matter for the NMR.

Now, looking at the options, we need to find the NMR that matches this structure. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm. The singlet at 9.9 is probably a carbonyl adjacent proton, like an aldehyde. But wait, the substituent is an acetyl group, which is a ketone. Aldehydes have protons, but ketones don't. So maybe this is an aldehyde group, but that would require substituent 2 to be CHO, which is only one carbon. Wait, but earlier, we thought substituent 2 is two carbons. So maybe substituent 2 is not an acetyl group. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an aldehyde and another group. Hmm, but earlier, substituent 2 would need to be two carbons. So perhaps this option is not correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). This looks like a di-substituted group, maybe ethylene glycol or something, but I don't see aromatic protons here. Since the compound is an aromatic ring with two substituents, we should expect aromatic protons in the NMR. Option B doesn't show any aromatic peaks, so I think this is incorrect.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons look like a pair of doublets, which suggests a para-substituted pattern for the substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is likely a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, like a carbonyl. So, for example, an acetyl group (O=C-CH3) would have a singlet at around 2.1-2.3 ppm for the methyl. So this could fit. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. But wait, where are they positioned? If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. So if the ring has Cl and COCH3 at para positions, the remaining two sets of protons would each be a pair of doublets. So the aromatic H NMR would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the 7.8 and 7.6 ppm peaks. And the 2.3 ppm is the methyl group. So this option looks promising.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aromatic proton if there's a substituent causing symmetry. But if the substituents are in the meta positions, perhaps leading to a single proton. But I'm not sure. The other peaks look like they're from an ethylene group, maybe an ethyl group attached to something else. But again, without aromatic protons, this doesn't fit. Wait, no, the 6.9 is an aromatic proton. So if there's a substituent in the para position, and another substituent perhaps next to it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substituent. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The compound has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and the other is a halogen (like Cl).

If the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern. For example, if one substituent is at position 1 and the other at position 3 (if 1,3-disubstituted), but wait, that's not para. Para would be positions 1 and 4. So in that case, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. Then, the remaining protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the protons adjacent to each substituent would be in positions 2 and 6 for substituent 1, and positions 3 and 5 for substituent 4. So the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is what option C shows.

So the aromatic protons in C are two doublets (2H each) at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That fits the scenario of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. So that would be the structure.

But wait, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So if the substituents are para, then the carbonyl and halogen are opposite each other. So the NMR would show aromatic protons as two doublets, which is what option C has.

But let me check option C again. The substituent would be Cl and COCH3 in para positions. Then, the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to each substituent. Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 4, the protons adjacent would be at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1), and at 3 and 5 (meta to substituent 4, which is para to substituent 1). So those protons would each couple with their adjacent substituents. But in this case, the two substituents are both deactivating (Cl is meta director, COCH3 is a strong deactivating group). So the NMR would show each set of protons as doublets.

So in the NMR, the four aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets. The upfield and downfield shifts would depend on the substituents. The protons ortho to the carbonyl (which is a strong deactivating group) would be more downfield. The protons ortho to the Cl would also be deshielded and appear downfield, but perhaps not as much as those near the carbonyl.

Wait, but in option C, the two doublets are at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That suggests that each pair is downfield, which makes sense with substituents that are deactivating. The methyl group at 2.3 ppm is consistent with an acetyl group.

So option C seems correct. But let me look back at the options. Option C's NMR shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). So that's four aromatic protons and a methyl. Benzene has six protons, so two substituents would make four aromatic protons. So that fits.

But wait, the carbonyl group is part of the substituent. So if the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then yes, that would give two substituents. So the structure would be para-chloroacetophenone, I think. Then, the NMR would match option C.

Wait, but another possibility: what if the substituent is an acetyl group and a methyl group? No, because the IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the correct NMR would be option C.
