Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's read it again. They say that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with various exponents on r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is the distance. Or wait, no, let me get that straight. The formula is r = 1 / plx. So if the parallax is small, the distance is large, and vice versa. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1 / plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, I can express N in terms of r.

Substitute plx = 1/r into N. So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/(1/(r^5)) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait a second. Because if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that seems like a lot. Does that make sense?

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So maybe they're asking about the differential, like the change in N per change in r. If N is proportional to r^5, then the change dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4, but wait, the question is phrased a bit differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the differential. Let me think. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars in a region as a function of r would be N(r) = k r^5, where k is some constant. But when you're looking at a range of distances, say from r to r + dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the difference N(r + dr) - N(r) = k ( (r + dr)^5 - r^5 ). Assuming dr is small compared to r, this can be approximated as k * 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) would be approximately proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (per dr) is increasing with r^4, meaning option C is ~r^4.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, more stars. But the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So if you have more stars as r increases, but the change per unit distance would depend on the derivative. Let me compute dN/dr.

dN/dr = d/dr (k r^5) ) = 5 k r^4. So yes, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But plx is 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So for a given distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But when considering how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range), that would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4. So the per unit change in distance (dr) would be proportional to r^4.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is not about the differential, but simply about the trend. If N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, the number increases as the fifth power. So per unit distance, the rate would be higher for larger r, hence option C is correct.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So the correct answer is C.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.
