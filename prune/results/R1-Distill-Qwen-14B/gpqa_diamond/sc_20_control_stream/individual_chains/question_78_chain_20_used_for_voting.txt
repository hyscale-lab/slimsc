Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving charge. Hmm, I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a given time and position. Let me think about what I remember from my electromagnetism classes.

The problem says there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at time t where t is greater than tr, which is the time when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with retarded potentials, especially for a moving charge, both the scalar and vector potentials depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time. The scalar potential V is usually similar to the Coulomb potential but adjusted for the retarded time, and the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge.

So the scalar potential V for a charge in motion is given by something like V = q/(4πε0 r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But wait, r' isn't directly given here. Oh, the vector d is from the retarded position to r, so I think the distance d is involved. Alternatively, maybe d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, which would make the distance |d|.

Wait, the expressions in the options have terms like (d c - d·v) in the denominator. So perhaps V involves something like dividing by (d c minus the dot product of d and v). Let me think about the form of the potentials.

The scalar potential for a charge in motion is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|r - r retarded|)], where r retarded is the position of the charge at the earlier time tr. But since the charge is moving, its position at tr is s(tr), and the field is observed at r, so the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So the distance is |d|.

But wait, I also remember that when the charge is moving, there's a correction term involving the velocity. Or wait, no. The scalar potential is more about the charge's position at the retarded time, while the vector potential involves the charge's velocity.

Wait, the general expressions for the potentials in terms of the charge's motion are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ (1/|r - r(tr)|) ) ] evaluated at the retarded time. But when the charge is moving, the potential depends on the point where the field was generated, which is at a different time.

Alternatively, more accurately, the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1 / (|d|)] * [ 1 / (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)) ) ]? Hmm, not sure. Wait, that's probably not right. Wait, perhaps the denominator includes (d c - v·d), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: I remember that for the scalar potential, it's just like the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V would be (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r - s(tr))], but since r is the field point and s(tr) is the position at time tr, the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So |d| is the distance between them. So V would be (q)/(4πε0 |d|) ?

Wait, but |d| is dependent on the charge's position and the observation point. Now, the vector potential A is given by A = (μ0 q)/(4π) * (v / (c²)) evaluated at the retarded time, but perhaps scaled by some factor involving d.

Wait, the vector potential from a moving charge is given by A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * v(r', t_r) / |r - r'|, where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time. So, substituting, since d is the vector from r' to r, |r - r'| is |d|, so A would be (μ0 q v) / (4π c² |d|) ) .

But looking at the options, option C has vector A as (μ0 qc v) / [4π (d c - d·v) ] . Hmm, but I don't see the dependence on |d| in the denominator. Oh wait, the denominator in C is (d c - d·v). Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe the denominator isn't |d| but something involving (d c - d·v). Let me think about the exact expression for the potentials.

Wait, perhaps the potentials are derived using the Liénard's result. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|))) ] ?

No, wait, I think that's more along the lines of how the fields are transformed under Lorentz contraction. Alternatively, maybe the denominator in V is (d c - v · d), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall the general form of the potentials. The scalar potential V and vector potential A of a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/(c)) ) ] 

Wait, no. Alternatively, considering the time delay and the motion, the expression for V would involve 1/(d(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about the expressions in the options. Option C has V(r,t) as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), and A as (mu0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d ·v )).

Wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v), which is c*d - v·d. So that's a scalar term, since d is a vector and c is scalar. Wait, no, d is a vector, so (d c) would be a vector scaled by c, and (d · v) is a scalar. So the denominator would be c*d minus the scalar product. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Oh wait, maybe d is a scalar—no, the question says d is a vector.

Wait a second, perhaps the correct expressions are derived using the Lorentz transformations or the retarded potentials formula.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V = (q)/(4πε0) * [1 / (|r - r(tr)|) ] 

But since r(tr) is the position of the charge at tr, the vector from r(tr) to r is d. So |r - r(tr)|= |d|.

So V = q/(4πε0 |d| )

But looking at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)). Hmm, but in the denominator, d c is a vector multiplied by c, and d·v is a scalar. So the denominator is a vector plus a scalar, which doesn't make sense because you can't add a vector and a scalar.

Wait, no, that can't be correct. All the terms in the denominator must be scalars. So perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (v · d̂) |d| ), which would factor out |d|, giving |d| (c - v·d̂ ), which is |d| (c - (v · d)/|d| ). So the denominator would be |d| (c - (v · d)/|d| ) = |d| c - (v · d).

Wait, that's interesting. So the denominator becomes (c |d| - v · d ), which is the same as (d c - v · d ) where d is |d|? Or wait, no, d is the vector, but in the denominator, maybe it's (c |d| - v · d ), which is a scalar.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in option C is actually c|d| - (v · d). Let me think again. Let me write d as the vector from r(tr) to r: d = r - r(tr). So |d| is the magnitude of this vector.

So the denominator in V would be (c |d| - v · d). Because v is the velocity at time tr, and d is the vector from r(tr) to r.

So option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v)).

Wait, but in the denominator, d c is a vector multiplied by c, which is a scalar. So d c is a vector, and d · v is a scalar. So adding a vector and a scalar doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps option C is written incorrectly, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is c |d| - v · d. Because c is a scalar, |d| is a scalar, and v · d is a scalar. So the denominator is a scalar, which makes sense. So perhaps option C's denominator is (c |d| - (v · d) ), which would be written as (d c - d · v), but d here is the magnitude, not the vector.

Wait, but option C's denominator is written as (d c - d · v), which seems to imply that d is a scalar. Hmm, that's confusing. Because d is a vector, unless they're using d to denote the magnitude. Maybe that's a notation issue.

Let me think of the options again. Option C:

V(r, t) = (qc) / [4πε0 (d c - d · v) ]

If d is the vector, then the denominator would have vector terms, which can't be right. So perhaps in this option, d is the magnitude of the vector d. So d would be |d|.

So the denominator is (|d| c - (v · d)).

Yes, that makes sense. So the denominator is |d| multiplied by c minus the dot product of v and d.

So in option C, V is (qc)/(4πε0 (|d| c - v · d) ), and A is (μ0 qc v)/(4π (|d| c - v · d) )

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the denominator, |d| c is a scalar, and v · d is a scalar, so their difference is a scalar.

So now, looking at the potentials:

The scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε0 (|d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c) )) )  ?

Wait, but from the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v) ) which can be written as (q c) / [4πε0 (c |d| - (v · d) ) ].

Wait, but I thought the scalar potential is similar to the Coulomb potential but with this denominator. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall the expressions from J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε0) * [1 / (|r - r(tr)|)] 

But since r(tr) is the position of the charge at the retarded time, and the vector from there to r is d, |r - r(tr)| = |d|.

So V(r, t) = q/(4πε0 |d| )

Wait, but that's what option A says for V. But option A's A is (v squared over c squared) times V. That can't be right because the vector potential should involve the velocity.

Wait, option A says A is (v²/c²) V. That doesn't make sense because A would have units of velocity times charge/(something), whereas this would make it (velocity squared times 1/velocity), which might not fit.

Alternatively, I'm probably missing some factors here. Let me think again.

The vector potential A is given by (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * (v / |d| )

So A = (μ0 q v) / (4π c² |d| )

But looking at the options, option C's A is (μ0 q c v) / [4π (d c - d · v) ]

Hmm, if we factor out |d| from the denominator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's plug in the expressions for V and A.

From option C, V is (q c)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v) )

Wait, but if d is |d|, then the denominator is |d| (c) - (v · d )

So denominator is |d| c - (v · d )

So V = (q c ) / [4π ε0 ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

Similarly, A is (μ0 q c v ) / [4π ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

So looking at the units:

For V, the unit is (C) * (C/(N·m²)) ) * (m) ) / ( m )?

Wait, no. Let's compute the units:

ε0 has units of C²·s²/(N·m³). So 1/(4π ε0) has units (N·m³)/(C²·s²).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should write it as:

V's unit is volts, which is J/C.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the denominator.

If V's denominator is (d c - d·v ), and c is m/s, and d is m, then (d c) is m²/s, and v·d is (m/s)·m = m²/s. So the denominator is in m²/s.

So V = ( q * c ) / [4π ε0 * (m²/s) ) ]

q is Coulombs.

So V has units (C * (m/s)) ) / ( (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) )

Wait, let's compute:

N is kg·m/s².

So ε0 is C²·s²/(N·m³) = C² s²/( (kg m/s²) m³ ) ) = C² s²/( kg m^4/s² ) ) = (C² s^4)/( kg m^4 )

So 1/(4π ε0 ) has units (kg m^4 )/( C² s^4 )

So V = [ q * c ] / [ (kg m^4 )/( C² s^4 ) ) * (m²/s) ) ]

Wait, q is in C, c is m/s.

So numerator: C * m/s

Denominator: [ kg m^4 / (C² s^4) ) * (m²/s) ) ] → kg m^6/( C² s^5 )

So V = (C m/s ) / ( kg m^6 / ( C^2 s^5 ) )) → (C m/s ) * ( C^2 s^5 ) / (kg m^6 ) )

Simplify:

C^3 s^4 / ( kg m^5 ) → Let's see, the unit for V is kg·m²/(s³·A·m) → Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the units are correct if I think in terms of the known expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compare the options to the standard expressions.

The standard expression for the vector potential A due to a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q )/(4π) * ( v(r', t_r) ) / (c² |r - r'| )

So here, r' is the position of the charge at time tr. Since d = r - r', |r - r'| is |d|. So A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

But in the options, option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) )

Wait, if I factor |d| from the denominator, (d c - d · v ) = |d| (c - (v · d̂) )

So A would be (μ0 q c v )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is (μ0 q c )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂)) ) ) * v

Wait, but the standard expression has v in the numerator and |d| in the denominator. So option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) )

Which is (μ0 q c v )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂)) )

Hmm. So that's different from the standard expression, which is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Wait, unless in option C, the denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂) ), which is |d| ( (c |d| - v · d ) / |d| ) ) = c |d| - v · d. So yes, that would be correct.

So if the denominator in A is |d| (c - (v · d̂) ), then A would be (μ0 q c v ) / [4π |d| ( c - (v · d̂) ) ) ]

But the standard expression has (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Wait, so unless my memory is wrong, perhaps the correct expressions have the denominator as |d| times (1 - (v · d̂)/c ), which would come from the Lorentz factor.

Wait, another thought: the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/( r' ) ] where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But when the charge is moving, the potential may have a correction factor. But I think that the scalar potential is just (q/(4πε0 r')), where r' is |d|.

But according to the problem, the options don't have any time derivatives or other factors in V, except for option C and D, which have terms involving c and v in the denominator.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the vector d is from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So the distance is |d|, and the V should be (q)/(4πε0 |d| ). So that would make V as in options A and C and D, but only option C has that term with a denominator that's not just |d|; but option A's V is (q)/(4πε0 r), which I think is correct.

But wait, in option A, A is (v² / c²) V. But that would make A a vector proportional to v squared, which doesn't make sense because A depends linearly on the velocity.

So option B has V as Coulomb's law, and A as (v/c²) * V. Let's think about the units here. 

The vector potential A has units of T·m²/A (or equivalently, V·s/m). Let's see:

If V is in volts, then (v/c²) * V has units (m/s) * (V) / (m²/s²) ) → (V s/m) )

Which matches the units for A. So option B's A is (v/c²) V.

But from the standard expression, A is (μ0 q v)/(4π c² |d| ). Let's compute that.

μ0 has units H/m = V·s/A. So μ0 q has units (V·s/A) * A = V·s.

v is m/s.

So numerator is V s * m/s → V m.

Denominator is 4π c^2 |d| → (m/s)^2 * m → m^3/s².

So overall, A has units (V m) / (m^3/s² ) ) → V s²/m².

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should instead think about the correct expressions for V and A.

Wait, from Maxwell's equations, the potentials satisfy:

E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t
B = ∇×A

For a point charge in motion, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1 / |r - r(tr)| ]

A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * [ v(r(tr), t_r) / |r - r(tr)| ]

So substituting r(tr) as the position at the retarded time, and |r - r(tr)| is |d|.

So, V is (q/(4πε0 |d| ) )

A is (μ0 q v) / (4π c² |d| )

Looking at the options, which option matches this?

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v) )

Wait, but in my expression, V is (q)/(4πε0 |d| ), which is option B's V.

Option B: V= q/(4πε0 r ), but wait in the problem, r is the field point, but d is the vector from the retarded point to r. So V should be in terms of d, not r. Therefore, none of the options directly match this.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let's re-express V and A in terms of d.

d is the vector from the retarded point to r, so |d| is the distance. So V is (q/(4πε0 |d| ) )

A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: V = qc/(4π ε0 ( d c - d·v) )

But if I factor |d| from denominator, it becomes |d| (c - (v·d̂) )

So V is (qc )/(4π ε0 |d| ( c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| ( c - (v · d̂) ) )

Wait, but my expression for V is (q)/(4π ε0 |d| )

So unless c/( c - (v·d̂) ) =1, which it's not, unless v is zero.

Hmm. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

What about option B: V is same as Coulomb, and A is (v/c^2) V.

So A = (v/c²) (q/(4π ε0 |d| )) )

Which would be ( q v )/(4π ε0 c² |d| )

But according to the standard expression, A is ( μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Hmm, so comparing the two:

Standard A: μ0 q v / (4 π c² |d| )

Option B's A: (q v)/(4 π ε0 c² |d| )

Are μ0 and ε0 related? Yes, because c² = 1/(μ0 ε0 )

So μ0 = 1/( ε0 c² )

So substituting into standard A:

( (1/( ε0 c² )) q v ) / (4 π c² |d| )

Which is ( q v )/(4 π ε0 c^4 |d| )

Which is not the same as option B's A, which is (q v )/(4 π ε0 c² |d| )

Hmm, so option B's A is larger by a factor of c².

So that suggests option B is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the potentials in terms of their definitions.

The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential evaluated at the retarded time, so V = q/(4πε0 |d| )

The vector potential A is given by (μ0/(4π)) * (q v)/(c² |d| )

So, A = ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² |d| )

So looking at the options, none of them directly match this except option C when the denominator is |d| multiplied by (c - (v · d̂) ), but the numerator is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, option C's vector A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v) )

If d c is |d| c, and d · v is v · d (since dot product is commutative), then denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂) )

So A = (μ0 q c v ) / [4π |d| (c - (v · d̂)) ]

But from the standard expression, A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

So unless c (c - (v · d̂) ) = c², which is not generally true.

Wait, but in the denominator of option C's A, we have |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) = |d| [ c - (v · (d/|d|) ) ]

Which is |d| c - (v · d )

So if I write A as (μ0 q c v ) / [4π ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

Which is (μ0 q c v ) / [4π ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

But the standard A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

So unless there's a relationship between ( |d| c - v · d ) and c² |d|.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem statement again. The options are at time t, where t > tr, and the vector d is from the retarded position to r.

So, in this scenario, the scalar potential V is the Coulomb potential due to the charge at its position at tr, so V = q/(4πε0 |d| )

Wait, but option C's V is (q c )/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v) )

Which would be (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

So V is (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is (q/(4π ε0 |d| )) * [ c/(c - (v · d̂) ) ]

So that's V = [ q/(4π ε0 |d| ) ] * [ c/(c - (v · d̂) ) ]

Hmm, that's different from the standard expression. So perhaps this is not the right V.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potentials are affected by the motion of the charge, and the expressions involve the term (1 - (v · d̂)/c ), which is the Lorentz factor denominator.

So, V would be (q/(4πε0 |d| )) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

Which would be (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is what option C's V is, except in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which if d is |d|, becomes |d| (c - (v · d̂) )

So V in option C is correct if that term is considered.

Similarly, the vector potential A would have the same denominator term.

So A would be (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) )

Which is (μ0 q v c )/(4π c² |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Simplifying, (μ0 q v )/(4π c |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Wait, but option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) ) → which, with d as |d|, is (μ0 q c v )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

So comparing, the standard expression for A would have (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ), which is (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [1/( 1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ]

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should instead look for the option that correctly includes both V and A with the same denominator term, which would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Perhaps I should think about the sources.

Wait, I think the correct expressions involve the denominator (c |d| - v · d ), which is the same as (d c - d · v ), assuming d is |d|. So that's option C.

So V is (qc)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v) ), and A is (μ0 qc v )/(4π (d c - d · v) )

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and the vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) for a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), we analyze the given options based on the standard expressions for retarded potentials.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{|d| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)},
     \]
     where \( |d| \) is the distance between the retarded position of the charge and the observation point, and \( \hat{d} = \frac{\vec{d}}{|d|} \) is the unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \). Expanding the denominator, this becomes:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]
     Here, \( d = |\vec{d}| \), and the denominator is \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential for a moving charge is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2 |d| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)}.
     \]
     Using the same denominator as for \( V \), this becomes:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 / c^2 \), which does not match the standard expression.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. While \( V \) matches the Coulomb potential, \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} / c^2 \), which omits the necessary factor of \( \mu_0 \) and the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - **Option C:** Correct. Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are expressed with the correct denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), and the numerator matches the standard expressions.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect. The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is incorrect, as it introduces an unphysical sign in the denominator.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) are given in **Option C**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving charge. Hmm, I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a given time and position. Let me think about what I remember from my electromagnetism classes.

The problem says there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at time t where t is greater than tr, which is the time when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with retarded potentials, especially for a moving charge, both the scalar and vector potentials depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time. The scalar potential V is usually similar to the Coulomb potential but adjusted for the retarded time, and the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge.

So the scalar potential V for a charge in motion is given by something like V = q/(4πε0 r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But wait, r' isn't directly given here. Oh, the vector d is from the retarded position to r, so I think the distance d is involved. Alternatively, maybe d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, which would make the distance |d|.

Wait, the expressions in the options have terms like (d c - d·v) in the denominator. So perhaps V involves something like dividing by (d c minus the dot product of d and v). Let me think about the form of the potentials.

The scalar potential for a charge in motion is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|r - r retarded|)], where r retarded is the position of the charge at the earlier time tr. But since the charge is moving, its position at tr is s(tr), and the field is observed at r, so the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So the distance is |d|.

But wait, I also remember that when the charge is moving, there's a correction term involving the velocity. Or wait, no. The scalar potential is more about the charge's position at the retarded time, while the vector potential involves the charge's velocity.

Wait, the general expressions for the potentials in terms of the charge's motion are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ (1/|r - r(tr)|) ) ] evaluated at the retarded time. But when the charge is moving, the potential depends on the point where the field was generated, which is at a different time.

Alternatively, more accurately, the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1 / (|d|)] * [ 1 / (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)) ) ]? Hmm, not sure. Wait, that's probably not right. Wait, perhaps the denominator includes (d c - v·d), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: I remember that for the scalar potential, it's just like the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V would be (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r - s(tr))], but since r is the field point and s(tr) is the position at time tr, the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So |d| is the distance between them. So V would be (q)/(4πε0 |d|) ?

Wait, but |d| is dependent on the charge's position and the observation point. Now, the vector potential A is given by A = (μ0 q)/(4π) * (v / (c²)) evaluated at the retarded time, but perhaps scaled by some factor involving d.

Wait, the vector potential from a moving charge is given by A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * v(r', t_r) / |r - r'|, where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time. So, substituting, since d is the vector from r' to r, |r - r'| is |d|, so A would be (μ0 q v) / (4π c² |d|) ) .

But looking at the options, option C has vector A as (μ0 qc v) / [4π (d c - d·v) ] . Hmm, but I don't see the dependence on |d| in the denominator. Oh wait, the denominator in C is (d c - d·v). Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe the denominator isn't |d| but something involving (d c - d·v). Let me think about the exact expression for the potentials.

Wait, perhaps the potentials are derived using the Liénard's result. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|))) ] ?

No, wait, I think that's more along the lines of how the fields are transformed under Lorentz contraction. Alternatively, maybe the denominator in V is (d c - v · d), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall the general form of the potentials. The scalar potential V and vector potential A of a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/(c)) ) ] 

Wait, no. Alternatively, considering the time delay and the motion, the expression for V would involve 1/(d(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about the expressions in the options. Option C has V(r,t) as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), and A as (mu0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d ·v )).

Wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v), which is c*d - v·d. So that's a scalar term, since d is a vector and c is scalar. Wait, no, d is a vector, so (d c) would be a vector scaled by c, and (d · v) is a scalar. So the denominator would be c*d minus the scalar product. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Oh wait, maybe d is a scalar—no, the question says d is a vector.

Wait a second, perhaps the correct expressions are derived using the Lorentz transformations or the retarded potentials formula.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V = (q)/(4πε0) * [1 / (|r - r(tr)|) ] 

But since r(tr) is the position of the charge at tr, the vector from r(tr) to r is d. So |r - r(tr)|= |d|.

So V = q/(4πε0 |d| )

But looking at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)). Hmm, but in the denominator, d c is a vector multiplied by c, and d·v is a scalar. So the denominator is a vector plus a scalar, which doesn't make sense because you can't add a vector and a scalar.

Wait, no, that can't be correct. All the terms in the denominator must be scalars. So perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (v · d̂) |d| ), which would factor out |d|, giving |d| (c - v·d̂ ), which is |d| (c - (v · d)/|d| ). So the denominator would be |d| (c - (v · d)/|d| ) = |d| c - (v · d).

Wait, that's interesting. So the denominator becomes (c |d| - v · d ), which is the same as (d c - v · d ) where d is |d|? Or wait, no, d is the vector, but in the denominator, maybe it's (c |d| - v · d ), which is a scalar.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in option C is actually c|d| - (v · d). Let me think again. Let me write d as the vector from r(tr) to r: d = r - r(tr). So |d| is the magnitude of this vector.

So the denominator in V would be (c |d| - v · d). Because v is the velocity at time tr, and d is the vector from r(tr) to r.

So option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v)).

Wait, but in the denominator, d c is a vector multiplied by c, which is a scalar. So d c is a vector, and d · v is a scalar. So adding a vector and a scalar doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps option C is written incorrectly, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is c |d| - v · d. Because c is a scalar, |d| is a scalar, and v · d is a scalar. So the denominator is a scalar, which makes sense. So perhaps option C's denominator is (c |d| - (v · d) ), which would be written as (d c - d · v), but d here is the magnitude, not the vector.

Wait, but option C's denominator is written as (d c - d · v), which seems to imply that d is a scalar. Hmm, that's confusing. Because d is a vector, unless they're using d to denote the magnitude. Maybe that's a notation issue.

Let me think of the options again. Option C:

V(r, t) = (qc) / [4πε0 (d c - d · v) ]

If d is the vector, then the denominator would have vector terms, which can't be right. So perhaps in this option, d is the magnitude of the vector d. So d would be |d|.

So the denominator is (|d| c - (v · d)).

Yes, that makes sense. So the denominator is |d| multiplied by c minus the dot product of v and d.

So in option C, V is (qc)/(4πε0 (|d| c - v · d) ), and A is (μ0 qc v)/(4π (|d| c - v · d) )

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the denominator, |d| c is a scalar, and v · d is a scalar, so their difference is a scalar.

So now, looking at the potentials:

The scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε0 (|d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c) )) )  ?

Wait, but from the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v) ) which can be written as (q c) / [4πε0 (c |d| - (v · d) ) ].

Wait, but I thought the scalar potential is similar to the Coulomb potential but with this denominator. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall the expressions from J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε0) * [1 / (|r - r(tr)|)] 

But since r(tr) is the position of the charge at the retarded time, and the vector from there to r is d, |r - r(tr)| = |d|.

So V(r, t) = q/(4πε0 |d| )

Wait, but that's what option A says for V. But option A's A is (v squared over c squared) times V. That can't be right because the vector potential should involve the velocity.

Wait, option A says A is (v²/c²) V. That doesn't make sense because A would have units of velocity times charge/(something), whereas this would make it (velocity squared times 1/velocity), which might not fit.

Alternatively, I'm probably missing some factors here. Let me think again.

The vector potential A is given by (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * (v / |d| )

So A = (μ0 q v) / (4π c² |d| )

But looking at the options, option C's A is (μ0 q c v) / [4π (d c - d · v) ]

Hmm, if we factor out |d| from the denominator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's plug in the expressions for V and A.

From option C, V is (q c)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v) )

Wait, but if d is |d|, then the denominator is |d| (c) - (v · d )

So denominator is |d| c - (v · d )

So V = (q c ) / [4π ε0 ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

Similarly, A is (μ0 q c v ) / [4π ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

So looking at the units:

For V, the unit is (C) * (C/(N·m²)) ) * (m) ) / ( m )?

Wait, no. Let's compute the units:

ε0 has units of C²·s²/(N·m³). So 1/(4π ε0) has units (N·m³)/(C²·s²).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should write it as:

V's unit is volts, which is J/C.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the denominator.

If V's denominator is (d c - d·v ), and c is m/s, and d is m, then (d c) is m²/s, and v·d is (m/s)·m = m²/s. So the denominator is in m²/s.

So V = ( q * c ) / [4π ε0 * (m²/s) ) ]

q is Coulombs.

So V has units (C * (m/s)) ) / ( (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) )

Wait, let's compute:

N is kg·m/s².

So ε0 is C²·s²/(N·m³) = C² s²/( (kg m/s²) m³ ) ) = C² s²/( kg m^4/s² ) ) = (C² s^4)/( kg m^4 )

So 1/(4π ε0 ) has units (kg m^4 )/( C² s^4 )

So V = [ q * c ] / [ (kg m^4 )/( C² s^4 ) ) * (m²/s) ) ]

Wait, q is in C, c is m/s.

So numerator: C * m/s

Denominator: [ kg m^4 / (C² s^4) ) * (m²/s) ) ] → kg m^6/( C² s^5 )

So V = (C m/s ) / ( kg m^6 / ( C^2 s^5 ) )) → (C m/s ) * ( C^2 s^5 ) / (kg m^6 ) )

Simplify:

C^3 s^4 / ( kg m^5 ) → Let's see, the unit for V is kg·m²/(s³·A·m) → Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the units are correct if I think in terms of the known expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compare the options to the standard expressions.

The standard expression for the vector potential A due to a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q )/(4π) * ( v(r', t_r) ) / (c² |r - r'| )

So here, r' is the position of the charge at time tr. Since d = r - r', |r - r'| is |d|. So A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

But in the options, option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) )

Wait, if I factor |d| from the denominator, (d c - d · v ) = |d| (c - (v · d̂) )

So A would be (μ0 q c v )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is (μ0 q c )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂)) ) ) * v

Wait, but the standard expression has v in the numerator and |d| in the denominator. So option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) )

Which is (μ0 q c v )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂)) )

Hmm. So that's different from the standard expression, which is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Wait, unless in option C, the denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂) ), which is |d| ( (c |d| - v · d ) / |d| ) ) = c |d| - v · d. So yes, that would be correct.

So if the denominator in A is |d| (c - (v · d̂) ), then A would be (μ0 q c v ) / [4π |d| ( c - (v · d̂) ) ) ]

But the standard expression has (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Wait, so unless my memory is wrong, perhaps the correct expressions have the denominator as |d| times (1 - (v · d̂)/c ), which would come from the Lorentz factor.

Wait, another thought: the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/( r' ) ] where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But when the charge is moving, the potential may have a correction factor. But I think that the scalar potential is just (q/(4πε0 r')), where r' is |d|.

But according to the problem, the options don't have any time derivatives or other factors in V, except for option C and D, which have terms involving c and v in the denominator.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the vector d is from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So the distance is |d|, and the V should be (q)/(4πε0 |d| ). So that would make V as in options A and C and D, but only option C has that term with a denominator that's not just |d|; but option A's V is (q)/(4πε0 r), which I think is correct.

But wait, in option A, A is (v² / c²) V. But that would make A a vector proportional to v squared, which doesn't make sense because A depends linearly on the velocity.

So option B has V as Coulomb's law, and A as (v/c²) * V. Let's think about the units here. 

The vector potential A has units of T·m²/A (or equivalently, V·s/m). Let's see:

If V is in volts, then (v/c²) * V has units (m/s) * (V) / (m²/s²) ) → (V s/m) )

Which matches the units for A. So option B's A is (v/c²) V.

But from the standard expression, A is (μ0 q v)/(4π c² |d| ). Let's compute that.

μ0 has units H/m = V·s/A. So μ0 q has units (V·s/A) * A = V·s.

v is m/s.

So numerator is V s * m/s → V m.

Denominator is 4π c^2 |d| → (m/s)^2 * m → m^3/s².

So overall, A has units (V m) / (m^3/s² ) ) → V s²/m².

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should instead think about the correct expressions for V and A.

Wait, from Maxwell's equations, the potentials satisfy:

E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t
B = ∇×A

For a point charge in motion, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1 / |r - r(tr)| ]

A(r, t) = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) * [ v(r(tr), t_r) / |r - r(tr)| ]

So substituting r(tr) as the position at the retarded time, and |r - r(tr)| is |d|.

So, V is (q/(4πε0 |d| ) )

A is (μ0 q v) / (4π c² |d| )

Looking at the options, which option matches this?

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v) )

Wait, but in my expression, V is (q)/(4πε0 |d| ), which is option B's V.

Option B: V= q/(4πε0 r ), but wait in the problem, r is the field point, but d is the vector from the retarded point to r. So V should be in terms of d, not r. Therefore, none of the options directly match this.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let's re-express V and A in terms of d.

d is the vector from the retarded point to r, so |d| is the distance. So V is (q/(4πε0 |d| ) )

A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: V = qc/(4π ε0 ( d c - d·v) )

But if I factor |d| from denominator, it becomes |d| (c - (v·d̂) )

So V is (qc )/(4π ε0 |d| ( c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| ( c - (v · d̂) ) )

Wait, but my expression for V is (q)/(4π ε0 |d| )

So unless c/( c - (v·d̂) ) =1, which it's not, unless v is zero.

Hmm. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

What about option B: V is same as Coulomb, and A is (v/c^2) V.

So A = (v/c²) (q/(4π ε0 |d| )) )

Which would be ( q v )/(4π ε0 c² |d| )

But according to the standard expression, A is ( μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

Hmm, so comparing the two:

Standard A: μ0 q v / (4 π c² |d| )

Option B's A: (q v)/(4 π ε0 c² |d| )

Are μ0 and ε0 related? Yes, because c² = 1/(μ0 ε0 )

So μ0 = 1/( ε0 c² )

So substituting into standard A:

( (1/( ε0 c² )) q v ) / (4 π c² |d| )

Which is ( q v )/(4 π ε0 c^4 |d| )

Which is not the same as option B's A, which is (q v )/(4 π ε0 c² |d| )

Hmm, so option B's A is larger by a factor of c².

So that suggests option B is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the potentials in terms of their definitions.

The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential evaluated at the retarded time, so V = q/(4πε0 |d| )

The vector potential A is given by (μ0/(4π)) * (q v)/(c² |d| )

So, A = ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² |d| )

So looking at the options, none of them directly match this except option C when the denominator is |d| multiplied by (c - (v · d̂) ), but the numerator is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, option C's vector A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v) )

If d c is |d| c, and d · v is v · d (since dot product is commutative), then denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂) )

So A = (μ0 q c v ) / [4π |d| (c - (v · d̂)) ]

But from the standard expression, A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

So unless c (c - (v · d̂) ) = c², which is not generally true.

Wait, but in the denominator of option C's A, we have |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) = |d| [ c - (v · (d/|d|) ) ]

Which is |d| c - (v · d )

So if I write A as (μ0 q c v ) / [4π ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

Which is (μ0 q c v ) / [4π ( |d| c - v · d ) ]

But the standard A is (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| )

So unless there's a relationship between ( |d| c - v · d ) and c² |d|.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem statement again. The options are at time t, where t > tr, and the vector d is from the retarded position to r.

So, in this scenario, the scalar potential V is the Coulomb potential due to the charge at its position at tr, so V = q/(4πε0 |d| )

Wait, but option C's V is (q c )/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v) )

Which would be (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

So V is (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is (q/(4π ε0 |d| )) * [ c/(c - (v · d̂) ) ]

So that's V = [ q/(4π ε0 |d| ) ] * [ c/(c - (v · d̂) ) ]

Hmm, that's different from the standard expression. So perhaps this is not the right V.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potentials are affected by the motion of the charge, and the expressions involve the term (1 - (v · d̂)/c ), which is the Lorentz factor denominator.

So, V would be (q/(4πε0 |d| )) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

Which would be (q c )/(4π ε0 |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Which is what option C's V is, except in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which if d is |d|, becomes |d| (c - (v · d̂) )

So V in option C is correct if that term is considered.

Similarly, the vector potential A would have the same denominator term.

So A would be (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) )

Which is (μ0 q v c )/(4π c² |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Simplifying, (μ0 q v )/(4π c |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

Wait, but option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) ) → which, with d as |d|, is (μ0 q c v )/(4π |d| (c - (v · d̂) ) )

So comparing, the standard expression for A would have (μ0 q v )/(4π c² |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ), which is (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [1/( 1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ]

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should instead look for the option that correctly includes both V and A with the same denominator term, which would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Perhaps I should think about the sources.

Wait, I think the correct expressions involve the denominator (c |d| - v · d ), which is the same as (d c - d · v ), assuming d is |d|. So that's option C.

So V is (qc)/(4π ε0 (d c - d · v) ), and A is (μ0 qc v )/(4π (d c - d · v) )

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and the vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) for a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), we analyze the given options based on the standard expressions for retarded potentials.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{|d| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)},
     \]
     where \( |d| \) is the distance between the retarded position of the charge and the observation point, and \( \hat{d} = \frac{\vec{d}}{|d|} \) is the unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \). Expanding the denominator, this becomes:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]
     Here, \( d = |\vec{d}| \), and the denominator is \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential for a moving charge is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2 |d| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)}.
     \]
     Using the same denominator as for \( V \), this becomes:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 / c^2 \), which does not match the standard expression.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. While \( V \) matches the Coulomb potential, \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} / c^2 \), which omits the necessary factor of \( \mu_0 \) and the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - **Option C:** Correct. Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are expressed with the correct denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), and the numerator matches the standard expressions.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect. The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is incorrect, as it introduces an unphysical sign in the denominator.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) are given in **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
