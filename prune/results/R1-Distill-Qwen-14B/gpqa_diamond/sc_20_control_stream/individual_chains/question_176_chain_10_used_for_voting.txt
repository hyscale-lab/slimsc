Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a system. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. In quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, but the elements are complex numbers, right? Or can they be real? I think real is fine too. But the vector given here has elements -1, 2, 1. So that's a 3-component vector. So the system is in a three-dimensional space, probably.

The operators for P and Q are given as matrices. Let me write those down.

Operator P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix, which suggests it's a set of eigenvalues: 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes of measuring Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. But wait, actually, the measurements are in the order P followed by Q. So first measure P, then Q. So the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no. The question says, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measured in that order.

So the steps are: first, measure P. If we get 0, then the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, using that new state, measure Q and get -1.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this as first finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

But wait, since Q is diagonal, its eigenvalues are on the diagonal. So eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Let me think about operator P. Let me call it matrix P.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But maybe it's easier to compute possible outcomes when measuring P. The possible eigenvalues are the possible outcomes.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's state is given. Let's denote the state vector as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Wait, but wait—that's a column vector, so it's a 3x1 matrix. But when dealing with quantum states, vectors are typically normalized such that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components equals 1.

Wait, let me check the given vector. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squared norm is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1,2,1]^T. But the question says the state is (-1, 2,1), so I think the actual vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1]^T, but not normalized. Wait no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized, so perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, but the question is about probabilities, so perhaps the state is not normalized. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think: when we compute probabilities, we usually consider the state as a unit vector. So if the state isn't normalized, perhaps the probabilities are scaled accordingly.

But perhaps the given state is just a vector, and I can proceed without worrying about normalization as the probabilities might come out correctly.

But let's see. So the first step is to measure P. The possible eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes. Let me find the eigenvalues of P.

Finding eigenvalues of P: solve det(P - λI) =0.

Matrix P - λI is:

[
-λ, 1/√2, 0
1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
0, 1/√2, -λ
]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant:

The matrix is a 3x3 with diagonal entries -λ, and off-diagonal non-zero entries where either row and column indices are adjacent or via certain connections.

Alternatively, perhaps P has some symmetry which I can exploit. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it has real eigenvalues. Also, perhaps it's a circulant matrix or something. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by finding eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors. Let me try for λ=0.

If λ=0, the equations are:

Row 1: 0x + (1/√2)y + 0z = 0 → (1/√2)y =0 → y=0.

Row 2: (1/√2)x +0y + (1/√2)z =0 → (1/√2)(x + z) =0 → x + z=0.

Row 3: 0x + (1/√2)y +0 z =0 → same as row 1: y=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 have y=0, and x = -z. So any vector of the form (x, 0, -x) is an eigenvector for λ=0. Let's pick x=1, so (1, 0, -1). But wait, the state given is (-1,2,1). Hmm, perhaps not, but perhaps this is the eigenvector.

Wait, but perhaps I can check if this is correct. Let me multiply P by this vector.

P * [1,0,-1]^T.

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0 → 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 -1/√2 )=0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1) → 0.

So yes, this vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So when measuring P, one of the possible outcomes is 0, with the eigenvector being (1, 0, -1)^T, up to a scalar multiple. Or any scalar multiple, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar.

Wait, but the given state is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me compute the inner product between this state and the eigenvector (1,0,-1)^T. Because the probability of getting 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.

Wait, but first, I should check if the state is normalized. The given state has components (-1,2,1). Its norm squared is 1 +4 +1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1,2,1)^T.

But the question doesn't specify whether the state is normalized. Hmm. But for probabilities, it's necessary because probabilities depend on the projection.

So perhaps I should normalize the state first. Let me proceed with that.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * |ψ>.

Now, the eigenvector for P=0 is |v_0> = [1, 0, -1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 0, -1]^T.

The probability of measuring P=0 is |<v_0 | ψ_normalized>|^2.

Compute the inner product:

< v_0 | ψ_normalized > = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Which is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/(sqrt(12))) * (-1 -1) = (1/(2*sqrt(3))) * (-2) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but the measurement of P could have other eigenvalues. Let me check if there are other possible eigenvalues besides 0.

But for the current problem, when we measure P, we get 0 with probability 1/3, and the state collapses to |v_0> (after normalization), which is [1,0,-1]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

Then, the next step is to measure Q.

Wait, but the problem states that after measuring P and getting 0, we measure Q and get -1. So we need the probability of this entire sequence: P=0 followed by Q=-1.

So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and the probability of Q=-1 given that P was 0.

But wait, no. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to |v_0>, so the state after measurement is |v_0> (up to normalization). Then, when measuring Q on this new state, what's the probability of getting -1.

So the steps:

1. Compute probability of P=0: 1/3.

2. For the state after P=0, compute the probability of Q=-1.

Then, multiply these probabilities to get the total probability.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the state after P=0 is |v_0>, so we can compute the expectation for Q in that state.

Let me first find the state after P=0. As per earlier, |v_0> is [1,0,-1]^T normalized by 1/sqrt(2).

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, measure Q. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvectors are |e1> = [1,0,0]^T (for eigenvalue 1), |e2> = [0,1,0]^T (eigenvalue 0), and |e3> = [0,0,1]^T (eigenvalue -1).

So the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

But wait, the state after P=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So when measuring Q on this state, the probabilities are:

- For Q=1: |<e1 | state>|^2 = |1/sqrt(2) * 1 |^2 = 1/2.

- For Q=0: |<e2 | state>|^2 = |0|^2 =0.

- For Q=-1: |<e3 | state>|^2 = |1/sqrt(2) * (-1)|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but that's interesting. So when the state is (1/sqrt(2))(1,0,-1), the probability to get Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3. Then, given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when P is measured and found to be 0, the state collapses to |v_0>, which is (1/sqrt(2))(1,0,-1). So when Q is measured, the outcome depends on the projection onto Q's eigenstates.

So the probability of Q=-1 is |<e3 |v_0>|^2.

Which is |(0,0,1) ⋅ (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))|² = | (-1/sqrt(2)) |² = 1/2.

So the calculation is correct.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps I messed up the measurement order. Because sometimes, the order of measurements can affect the outcome probabilities if the operators don't commute. But in this case, I think the approach is correct because after measuring P, the state is projected into an eigenvector of P, and then Q is measured on that state.

So the answer is D) 1/6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The initial state of the system is given as the column vector \( | \psi \rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \), and the operators \( P \) and \( Q \) are represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to find the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state \( | \psi \rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \) has a norm squared of \( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \), so the normalized state is:
\[
| \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
By analyzing \( P \), it is found that one of its eigenvalues is \( \lambda = 0 \), with the corresponding eigenvector:
\[
| v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \) onto \( | v_0 \rangle \):
\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2.
\]
Calculating the inner product:
\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 - 1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The absolute value squared is:
\[
P(P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( | v_0 \rangle \), normalized as:
\[
| v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors \( | e_1 \rangle = [1, 0, 0]^T \), \( | e_2 \rangle = [0, 1, 0]^T \), and \( | e_3 \rangle = [0, 0, 1]^T \).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( | v_0 \rangle \) onto \( | e_3 \rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \langle e_3 | v_0 \rangle \right|^2.
\]
Calculating the inner product:
\[
\langle e_3 | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-1) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The absolute value squared is:
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Overall probability
The overall probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \) is:
\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
