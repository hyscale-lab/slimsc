Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian plays a big role. 

Wait, the potential looks like it has two parts. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks familiar. Oh right, that's similar to the harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, how can I interpret that? Maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts.

So, the total potential V(r,θ) can be written as V(r) + V'(r,θ), where V(r) is the first term and V'(r,θ) is the second. Wait, but the second term is 3/2 k r² cos²θ. Let me think about how this splits in the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is (p²/(2m)) + V(r,θ), right? So p² is the momentum squared, which in polar coordinates expands into -(ħ²)(∂²_r + (1/r) ∂_r + (1/r²) ∂²_θ). 

Wait, maybe I can separate this into radial and angular parts. Let me see. The potential can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r² cos²θ). Hmm, maybe I can factor out r². So, V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2 k cos²θ) ].

Wait, that doesn't immediately help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the potential in terms of cos(2θ), since cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me try that: 

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Wait, let's compute that. So, (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3k r²/4)(1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential becomes:

V(r) = (1/2) k r² + (3k/4) r² * 1 + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, combining the terms without cos2θ: (1/2 k r² + 3k/4 r²) = ( (2k +3k)/4 ) r² = (5k/4) r². So, V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might be useful. So, the potential depends on cos2θ. Now, considering the angular part of the Hamiltonian. The kinetic energy part in the angular direction is -(ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²). But when you have a potential that includes cos2θ, it affects the angular part of the equation. 

Wait, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, when you have a central potential, you can separate into radial and angular parts. But when the potential has angular dependencies, it complicates things. Alternatively, maybe this potential can be rewritten in a way that looks like a perturbation or perhaps a shifted oscillator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of new coordinates. For example, sometimes when dealing with central potentials with angular terms, it's helpful to use a shift in the radial direction or consider polar coordinates in a different way.

Wait, another thought: The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Breaking that into terms, that's (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ. So, V(r, θ) becomes (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute it correctly. 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2. So, (1/2)k r² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ] = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that:

= (k r²/2) [1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ]

= (k r²/2) [ (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2 cos2θ) ]

= (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ]

= (k r²) (5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ).

So, V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but how does this affect the Hamiltonian?

The total Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ).

Wait, but when you have a potential that includes cos2θ, it can be expressed as a function of cos2θ, which might lead to an angular part of the Hamiltonian that can be solved more easily.

Let me think about the angular part. The angular part of the Hamiltonian is ( - ħ²/(2m r²) ) d²/dθ² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution for the angle. Let me think. Suppose I let φ = 2θ, then maybe the potential becomes a function of cosφ. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the potential in terms of a new variable or shift the problem into a different coordinate system. Wait, another approach: sometimes potentials with cos2θ can be rewritten using a shift in the angle, but I'm not recalling the exact method.

Wait, maybe if I express the entire potential as a function of cosθ, but I don't see an immediate simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted harmonic oscillator. Let me think. Suppose I make a substitution for the radial variable. Let me define a new variable y = r sqrt(k/m), perhaps. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another angle: the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (k r²/2), so V = (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm, so V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ].

Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = (2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2.

So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5k r²/4) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

Hmm, so the potential has a term proportional to r² and another to r² cos2θ. Now, the kinetic energy in polar coordinates is (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ).

But if the potential has a cos2θ term, this might mix with the angular momentum part. Let me think about this.

The angular part of the kinetic energy is (L²)/(2m r²), where L is the angular momentum. L² is ħ² n(n+1), where n is the angular quantum number.

Wait, but the potential has a term involving cos2θ. So, maybe we can write the potential as (3k r²/4) cos2θ, which might couple with the angular momentum term.

Wait, but cos2θ can be expressed in terms of L. Because, I remember that in spherical coordinates, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is [ - (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²/dθ²) + (ħ² cosθ/(2m r²)) (d/dθ) ... wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the potential as (3k r²/4) cos2θ and see how it affects the Hamiltonian. Let me think about the angular part.

The angular part of the Hamiltonian is ( - ħ²/(2m r²) ) (d²/dθ²) + V(θ), where V(θ) is the angular part of the potential. So here, V(θ) = 3k r² cos2θ / 4.

Wait, but the angular part of the potential is V_θ(θ) = (3k r²/4) cos2θ. 

Hmm, but the angular part of the kinetic energy is [ -(ħ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² ].

So, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is:

H_θ = - (ħ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

Hmm, this looks a bit like the standard angular momentum problem but with an added potential term. Let me try to find the eigenstates for H_θ.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let φ = 2θ. Then, d/dθ = 2 d/dφ. So, d²/dθ² = 4 d²/dφ².

So, substituting into H_θ:

H_θ = - (ħ²/(2m r²)) * 4 d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

So, H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. Now, the equation becomes:

H_θ ψ = [ - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) (d²/dφ²) + (3k r²/4) cosφ ] ψ = E_θ ψ.

Wait, but E_θ would be the eigenvalue for the angular part. Now, I'm trying to recall if there's an equation that looks like this. The standard equation for the angular part in the hydrogen atom or harmonic oscillator is different, but perhaps this resembles the Mathieu equation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps this can be interpreted as a shifted oscillator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can rewrite this Hamiltonian as a standard harmonic oscillator plus a constant shift. Let me see.

Let me factor out the (ħ²/(m r²)) term from the kinetic part. So,

H_θ = (ħ²/(m r²)) [ -2 d²/dφ² ] + (3k r²/4) cos φ.

Hmm, I'm not seeing an immediate way to make this a standard harmonic oscillator. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the variable to center the potential.

Wait, another idea: the potential V(φ) = (3k r²/4) cosφ. So, the angular part includes a cosφ term, which is similar to the potential in a shifted oscillator. Maybe we can perform a substitution such as ψ(φ) = e^{i a φ} χ(φ), where a is a constant chosen to eliminate the first-order term in the equation.

Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written in terms of an effective angular momentum shift.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let's consider the total potential:

V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the potential in terms of a new variable. Let me think about it. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the variables in terms of r and θ, but the presence of both terms complicates things.

Wait, another approach: in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian can sometimes be written in terms of the radial and angular parts. The total Hamiltonian is H = H_r + H_θ, where H_r is the radial part and H_θ is the angular part.

But in this case, the potential depends on both r and θ, so H_r depends on θ as well, which makes separation more difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a transformation to a new set of variables where the potential becomes separable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can define a new angle variable, say, ψ = 2θ, and then see if the potential becomes a function of ψ. Then, perhaps the angular part can be treated as a harmonic oscillator.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the angular part again. The angular part's H_θ is:

H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how to solve this. Maybe I should make an ansatz for the solution ψ(φ) and see if it can be expressed in terms of known functions.

Wait, perhaps I can think about this equation as a modified harmonic oscillator. The standard harmonic oscillator in φ would have H = - (m ω²/2) d²/dφ² + (1/2) m ω² φ². But in our case, the potential is proportional to cosφ, which is not the same as φ².

Wait, that's a problem. Maybe I can consider a shift in the variable. Let me try substituting φ = x + y, where y is a constant shift.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that would help. Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as:

H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ = E_θ.

Hmm, perhaps this is similar to the equation for a particle in a potential well with a cosine term. But I'm not familiar with the exact solution method.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the entire Hamiltonian and see if the potential can be expressed as a sum of two harmonic oscillators. Let me think: the potential is V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, if I can write this as a sum of functions, perhaps each of which is a function that allows for separation of variables. For example, perhaps using a shifted r coordinate.

Wait, another idea: Let me define a new radial variable, say, y = r * sqrt(k/m). Then, the kinetic energy term in terms of y would be something like (p_y^2)/(2m) * (m/k) ), but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the total potential as a product of functions in r and θ. But in this case, the potential has r squared multiplied by cos2θ, so it's not separable. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should diagonalize the angular part first, treating r as a parameter. Then, the angular part's energy eigenvalues can be expressed in terms of r, and then I can combine that with the radial part.

So, H_θ ψ = E_θ ψ.

But solving H_θ is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to make it look like a standard oscillator equation.

Wait, H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

Let me rearrange this equation:

d²ψ/dφ² = [ (m r² (E_θ - (3k r²/4) cosφ )) / (2 ħ²) ] ψ.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the wavefunction. Let me let ψ(φ) = e^{i a φ} χ(φ), where a is chosen to eliminate some terms.

But I'm not seeing an obvious way to proceed here. Maybe it's time to think differently. Perhaps the given potential can be interpreted as a combination of radial and angular harmonic oscillators.

Wait, another approach: think about the potential as a sum of two terms: the radial term and the angular term. The radial part is (5k/4) r², which is like a harmonic oscillator. The angular part is (3k/4 r²) cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps the angular part can be treated as a perturbation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part itself is another harmonic oscillator in disguise.

Wait, another idea: Let me express cos2θ in terms of L². Because I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is related to the angular momentum L, and perhaps the potential can be written in terms of L.

Wait, cosθ can be expressed in terms of L·z, where z is the unit vector in the z direction. Because L·z = ħ cosθ. So, cosθ = (L·z)/ħ.

Wait, but in our case, the potential has cos2θ. So, cos2θ = 2 cos²θ - 1 = 2 ( (L·z)/ħ )² -1.

Hmm, so the angular part of the potential is (3k r²/4) (2 (L·z)^2/(ħ²) -1 ) = (3k r²/4)( 2 (L_z)^2/ħ² -1).

So, V_angle = (3k r²/4) * (2 (L_z)^2/ħ² -1) = (3k r²/2) (L_z²/ħ²) - (3k r²/4).

Wait, so the total potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4 r² cos2θ) 

= (5k/4) r² + [ (3k r²/2) (L_z²/ħ²) - (3k r²/4) ] 

= (5k/4) r² - 3k r²/4 + (3k r²/2) (L_z²/ħ² )

Simplify the constants:

(5k/4 - 3k/4) r² = (2k/4) r² = (k/2) r².

So, V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² + (3k r²/2) (L_z^2)/(ħ^2).

Hmm, this looks interesting. Now, the potential is written as a sum of a radial harmonic oscillator term and a term involving L_z squared. 

So, the Hamiltonian can be written as:

H = H_radial + V(r,θ), where H_radial is the radial part of the kinetic energy plus (k/2) r².

Wait, H_radial would be (p_r²)/(2m) + (k/2) r².

H_radial = (1/(2m)) ( -ħ² d²/dr² + (ħ²/m r) ) + (k/2) r².

Wait, but wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² + (3k r²/2) (L_z²)/(ħ²).

So, the total Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (k/2) r² + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2.

Now, since L_z is the angular momentum operator in the z direction, which commutes with the radial parts of the Hamiltonian, perhaps we can separate the variables.

So, the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as:

H = [ (p_r²)/(2m) + (k/2) r² ] + [ (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2 ].

Hmm, but wait, the term (3k r² L_z²)/(2 ħ²) is a function of r and θ, which complicates things. Because L_z is ħ times the angular momentum quantum number n (n is an integer), but r is a variable here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express L_z^2 in terms of n, but since L_z is an operator, it's more involved.

Wait, perhaps the term (3k r² L_z^2)/(2 ħ²) can be expressed as (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) (n^2 ħ^2), where n is the angular quantum number. Because L_z^2 |n⟩ = n^2 ħ^2 |n⟩.

Wait, but then that term becomes (3k r² n^2)/(2 m r²) ), because the denominator has ħ squared. Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) * L_z^2 = (3k r² n^2 ħ^2 )/( 2 ħ^2 ) = (3k n^2 r² )/(2).

So, the angular part of the potential becomes (3k n^2 r² )/(2).

Wait, but that's a function of r, which complicates separation. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire term involving L_z^2 can be treated as part of the angular momentum, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as a sum of two terms, each of which is a harmonic oscillator. Let me think.

Looking back, the radial part of the Hamiltonian is H_r = (p_r²)/(2m) + (k/2) r². That's the standard one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The angular part is H_θ = (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2.

Wait, but the angular part H_θ also depends on r, which is a variable. So, it's challenging to separate the variables. 

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution for the angular part. Let me define a new variable, say, y = r^2. Then, the angular part would depend on y, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be expressed as another harmonic oscillator in terms of a new variable. Let me see:

The angular part is H_θ = (p_θ^2)/(2m r²) + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2.

Wait, but L_z^2 is proportional to n^2 ħ^2, so substituting that in, perhaps the angular part becomes (p_θ^2)/(2m r²) + (3k n^2 r^2 )/(2 m).

Hmm, but then this is still a function of r, which is a variable, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can redefine the angular momentum term by introducing a new variable that combines r and θ. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the entire problem in terms of a product of functions, each depending on r and θ. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy spectrum. The options given are combinations of n_x and n_y, but wait, wait, no, the options have n_x and n_y as quantum numbers, but wait, in two dimensions, the quantum numbers are usually n_r (radial) and n_θ (angular), but perhaps the problem is using different quantum numbers.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: (2n_x + 3n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)
Option B: (n_x + 3n_y + 3/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)
Option C: (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)
Option D: (3n_x + 2n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)

Hmm, the energy seems to have terms linear in n_x and n_y multiplied by sqrt(k/m), which suggests that each direction contributes a harmonic oscillator term.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Let me try that.

The potential in Cartesian coordinates would be (since r^2 = x^2 + y^2, and cosθ = x/r). So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y^2).

Wait, because cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r².

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y²) )

Simplify: The second term becomes (3/2)k x².

So, V(x,y) = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x².

Combining like terms:

= (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y².

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Ah! Now that's a separable potential. That makes things easier. Because in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions.

So, in x-direction: harmonic oscillator with frequency sqrt(2k/m), because the potential is (1/2) m ω² x², where ω² = (2k/m), so ω = sqrt(2k/m).

In y-direction: harmonic oscillator with frequency sqrt(k/m), since potential is (1/2) m ω² y², ω² = k/m.

Wait, but wait: the potential in x is 2k x², so to write in standard form (1/2 m ω² x² ), we have (1/2 m ω² x² ) = 2k x².

So, 1/2 m ω² = 2k → ω² = 4k/m → ω = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, in y-direction: (1/2 m ω² y²) = (1/2)k y² → ω² = k/m → ω = sqrt(k/m).

So, the x and y directions are independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies 2 sqrt(k/m) and sqrt(k/m), respectively.

In quantum mechanics, the energy levels for each direction are quantized. For a harmonic oscillator in x, the energy is E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x. Similarly for y: E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

So, the total energy E is E_x + E_y.

Substituting the frequencies:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) = (2 n_x + 1) ħ sqrt(k/m) * (sqrt(4k/m) / sqrt(k/m)) ? Wait, wait, maybe better to compute ω_x and ω_y:

ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So, E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)).

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ (sqrt(k/m)).

Total energy E = E_x + E_y = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let's compute that:

E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m)

= [ 2 n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ħ sqrt(k/m)

= (2 n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, that's option C: (2n_x +n_y +3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos\theta = x/r \). Substituting these, the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k x^2.
   \]  
   Simplifying, this separates into:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This shows that the potential consists of two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

2. **Energy Quantization**:  
   For a harmonic oscillator in the \( x \)-direction, the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
   \]  
   Similarly, for the \( y \)-direction:  
   \[
   E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   The total energy is the sum of these contributions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, the correct match is:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to **Option C**.

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum of the particle is determined by the independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, leading to the energy expression in Option C.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian plays a big role. 

Wait, the potential looks like it has two parts. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks familiar. Oh right, that's similar to the harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, how can I interpret that? Maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts.

So, the total potential V(r,θ) can be written as V(r) + V'(r,θ), where V(r) is the first term and V'(r,θ) is the second. Wait, but the second term is 3/2 k r² cos²θ. Let me think about how this splits in the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is (p²/(2m)) + V(r,θ), right? So p² is the momentum squared, which in polar coordinates expands into -(ħ²)(∂²_r + (1/r) ∂_r + (1/r²) ∂²_θ). 

Wait, maybe I can separate this into radial and angular parts. Let me see. The potential can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r² cos²θ). Hmm, maybe I can factor out r². So, V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2 k cos²θ) ].

Wait, that doesn't immediately help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the potential in terms of cos(2θ), since cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me try that: 

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Wait, let's compute that. So, (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3k r²/4)(1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential becomes:

V(r) = (1/2) k r² + (3k/4) r² * 1 + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, combining the terms without cos2θ: (1/2 k r² + 3k/4 r²) = ( (2k +3k)/4 ) r² = (5k/4) r². So, V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might be useful. So, the potential depends on cos2θ. Now, considering the angular part of the Hamiltonian. The kinetic energy part in the angular direction is -(ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²). But when you have a potential that includes cos2θ, it affects the angular part of the equation. 

Wait, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, when you have a central potential, you can separate into radial and angular parts. But when the potential has angular dependencies, it complicates things. Alternatively, maybe this potential can be rewritten in a way that looks like a perturbation or perhaps a shifted oscillator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of new coordinates. For example, sometimes when dealing with central potentials with angular terms, it's helpful to use a shift in the radial direction or consider polar coordinates in a different way.

Wait, another thought: The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Breaking that into terms, that's (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ. So, V(r, θ) becomes (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute it correctly. 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2. So, (1/2)k r² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ] = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that:

= (k r²/2) [1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ]

= (k r²/2) [ (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2 cos2θ) ]

= (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ]

= (k r²) (5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ).

So, V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but how does this affect the Hamiltonian?

The total Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ).

Wait, but when you have a potential that includes cos2θ, it can be expressed as a function of cos2θ, which might lead to an angular part of the Hamiltonian that can be solved more easily.

Let me think about the angular part. The angular part of the Hamiltonian is ( - ħ²/(2m r²) ) d²/dθ² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution for the angle. Let me think. Suppose I let φ = 2θ, then maybe the potential becomes a function of cosφ. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the potential in terms of a new variable or shift the problem into a different coordinate system. Wait, another approach: sometimes potentials with cos2θ can be rewritten using a shift in the angle, but I'm not recalling the exact method.

Wait, maybe if I express the entire potential as a function of cosθ, but I don't see an immediate simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted harmonic oscillator. Let me think. Suppose I make a substitution for the radial variable. Let me define a new variable y = r sqrt(k/m), perhaps. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another angle: the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (k r²/2), so V = (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm, so V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ].

Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = (2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2.

So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5k r²/4) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

Hmm, so the potential has a term proportional to r² and another to r² cos2θ. Now, the kinetic energy in polar coordinates is (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ).

But if the potential has a cos2θ term, this might mix with the angular momentum part. Let me think about this.

The angular part of the kinetic energy is (L²)/(2m r²), where L is the angular momentum. L² is ħ² n(n+1), where n is the angular quantum number.

Wait, but the potential has a term involving cos2θ. So, maybe we can write the potential as (3k r²/4) cos2θ, which might couple with the angular momentum term.

Wait, but cos2θ can be expressed in terms of L. Because, I remember that in spherical coordinates, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is [ - (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²/dθ²) + (ħ² cosθ/(2m r²)) (d/dθ) ... wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the potential as (3k r²/4) cos2θ and see how it affects the Hamiltonian. Let me think about the angular part.

The angular part of the Hamiltonian is ( - ħ²/(2m r²) ) (d²/dθ²) + V(θ), where V(θ) is the angular part of the potential. So here, V(θ) = 3k r² cos2θ / 4.

Wait, but the angular part of the potential is V_θ(θ) = (3k r²/4) cos2θ. 

Hmm, but the angular part of the kinetic energy is [ -(ħ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² ].

So, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is:

H_θ = - (ħ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

Hmm, this looks a bit like the standard angular momentum problem but with an added potential term. Let me try to find the eigenstates for H_θ.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let φ = 2θ. Then, d/dθ = 2 d/dφ. So, d²/dθ² = 4 d²/dφ².

So, substituting into H_θ:

H_θ = - (ħ²/(2m r²)) * 4 d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

So, H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. Now, the equation becomes:

H_θ ψ = [ - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) (d²/dφ²) + (3k r²/4) cosφ ] ψ = E_θ ψ.

Wait, but E_θ would be the eigenvalue for the angular part. Now, I'm trying to recall if there's an equation that looks like this. The standard equation for the angular part in the hydrogen atom or harmonic oscillator is different, but perhaps this resembles the Mathieu equation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps this can be interpreted as a shifted oscillator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can rewrite this Hamiltonian as a standard harmonic oscillator plus a constant shift. Let me see.

Let me factor out the (ħ²/(m r²)) term from the kinetic part. So,

H_θ = (ħ²/(m r²)) [ -2 d²/dφ² ] + (3k r²/4) cos φ.

Hmm, I'm not seeing an immediate way to make this a standard harmonic oscillator. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the variable to center the potential.

Wait, another idea: the potential V(φ) = (3k r²/4) cosφ. So, the angular part includes a cosφ term, which is similar to the potential in a shifted oscillator. Maybe we can perform a substitution such as ψ(φ) = e^{i a φ} χ(φ), where a is a constant chosen to eliminate the first-order term in the equation.

Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written in terms of an effective angular momentum shift.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let's consider the total potential:

V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the potential in terms of a new variable. Let me think about it. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the variables in terms of r and θ, but the presence of both terms complicates things.

Wait, another approach: in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian can sometimes be written in terms of the radial and angular parts. The total Hamiltonian is H = H_r + H_θ, where H_r is the radial part and H_θ is the angular part.

But in this case, the potential depends on both r and θ, so H_r depends on θ as well, which makes separation more difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a transformation to a new set of variables where the potential becomes separable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can define a new angle variable, say, ψ = 2θ, and then see if the potential becomes a function of ψ. Then, perhaps the angular part can be treated as a harmonic oscillator.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the angular part again. The angular part's H_θ is:

H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how to solve this. Maybe I should make an ansatz for the solution ψ(φ) and see if it can be expressed in terms of known functions.

Wait, perhaps I can think about this equation as a modified harmonic oscillator. The standard harmonic oscillator in φ would have H = - (m ω²/2) d²/dφ² + (1/2) m ω² φ². But in our case, the potential is proportional to cosφ, which is not the same as φ².

Wait, that's a problem. Maybe I can consider a shift in the variable. Let me try substituting φ = x + y, where y is a constant shift.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that would help. Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as:

H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ = E_θ.

Hmm, perhaps this is similar to the equation for a particle in a potential well with a cosine term. But I'm not familiar with the exact solution method.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the entire Hamiltonian and see if the potential can be expressed as a sum of two harmonic oscillators. Let me think: the potential is V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, if I can write this as a sum of functions, perhaps each of which is a function that allows for separation of variables. For example, perhaps using a shifted r coordinate.

Wait, another idea: Let me define a new radial variable, say, y = r * sqrt(k/m). Then, the kinetic energy term in terms of y would be something like (p_y^2)/(2m) * (m/k) ), but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the total potential as a product of functions in r and θ. But in this case, the potential has r squared multiplied by cos2θ, so it's not separable. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should diagonalize the angular part first, treating r as a parameter. Then, the angular part's energy eigenvalues can be expressed in terms of r, and then I can combine that with the radial part.

So, H_θ ψ = E_θ ψ.

But solving H_θ is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to make it look like a standard oscillator equation.

Wait, H_θ = - (2 ħ²/(m r²)) d²/dφ² + (3k r²/4) cosφ.

Let me rearrange this equation:

d²ψ/dφ² = [ (m r² (E_θ - (3k r²/4) cosφ )) / (2 ħ²) ] ψ.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the wavefunction. Let me let ψ(φ) = e^{i a φ} χ(φ), where a is chosen to eliminate some terms.

But I'm not seeing an obvious way to proceed here. Maybe it's time to think differently. Perhaps the given potential can be interpreted as a combination of radial and angular harmonic oscillators.

Wait, another approach: think about the potential as a sum of two terms: the radial term and the angular term. The radial part is (5k/4) r², which is like a harmonic oscillator. The angular part is (3k/4 r²) cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps the angular part can be treated as a perturbation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part itself is another harmonic oscillator in disguise.

Wait, another idea: Let me express cos2θ in terms of L². Because I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is related to the angular momentum L, and perhaps the potential can be written in terms of L.

Wait, cosθ can be expressed in terms of L·z, where z is the unit vector in the z direction. Because L·z = ħ cosθ. So, cosθ = (L·z)/ħ.

Wait, but in our case, the potential has cos2θ. So, cos2θ = 2 cos²θ - 1 = 2 ( (L·z)/ħ )² -1.

Hmm, so the angular part of the potential is (3k r²/4) (2 (L·z)^2/(ħ²) -1 ) = (3k r²/4)( 2 (L_z)^2/ħ² -1).

So, V_angle = (3k r²/4) * (2 (L_z)^2/ħ² -1) = (3k r²/2) (L_z²/ħ²) - (3k r²/4).

Wait, so the total potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4 r² cos2θ) 

= (5k/4) r² + [ (3k r²/2) (L_z²/ħ²) - (3k r²/4) ] 

= (5k/4) r² - 3k r²/4 + (3k r²/2) (L_z²/ħ² )

Simplify the constants:

(5k/4 - 3k/4) r² = (2k/4) r² = (k/2) r².

So, V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² + (3k r²/2) (L_z^2)/(ħ^2).

Hmm, this looks interesting. Now, the potential is written as a sum of a radial harmonic oscillator term and a term involving L_z squared. 

So, the Hamiltonian can be written as:

H = H_radial + V(r,θ), where H_radial is the radial part of the kinetic energy plus (k/2) r².

Wait, H_radial would be (p_r²)/(2m) + (k/2) r².

H_radial = (1/(2m)) ( -ħ² d²/dr² + (ħ²/m r) ) + (k/2) r².

Wait, but wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² + (3k r²/2) (L_z²)/(ħ²).

So, the total Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (k/2) r² + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2.

Now, since L_z is the angular momentum operator in the z direction, which commutes with the radial parts of the Hamiltonian, perhaps we can separate the variables.

So, the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as:

H = [ (p_r²)/(2m) + (k/2) r² ] + [ (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2 ].

Hmm, but wait, the term (3k r² L_z²)/(2 ħ²) is a function of r and θ, which complicates things. Because L_z is ħ times the angular momentum quantum number n (n is an integer), but r is a variable here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express L_z^2 in terms of n, but since L_z is an operator, it's more involved.

Wait, perhaps the term (3k r² L_z^2)/(2 ħ²) can be expressed as (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) (n^2 ħ^2), where n is the angular quantum number. Because L_z^2 |n⟩ = n^2 ħ^2 |n⟩.

Wait, but then that term becomes (3k r² n^2)/(2 m r²) ), because the denominator has ħ squared. Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) * L_z^2 = (3k r² n^2 ħ^2 )/( 2 ħ^2 ) = (3k n^2 r² )/(2).

So, the angular part of the potential becomes (3k n^2 r² )/(2).

Wait, but that's a function of r, which complicates separation. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire term involving L_z^2 can be treated as part of the angular momentum, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as a sum of two terms, each of which is a harmonic oscillator. Let me think.

Looking back, the radial part of the Hamiltonian is H_r = (p_r²)/(2m) + (k/2) r². That's the standard one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The angular part is H_θ = (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2.

Wait, but the angular part H_θ also depends on r, which is a variable. So, it's challenging to separate the variables. 

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution for the angular part. Let me define a new variable, say, y = r^2. Then, the angular part would depend on y, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be expressed as another harmonic oscillator in terms of a new variable. Let me see:

The angular part is H_θ = (p_θ^2)/(2m r²) + (3k r²)/(2 ħ²) L_z^2.

Wait, but L_z^2 is proportional to n^2 ħ^2, so substituting that in, perhaps the angular part becomes (p_θ^2)/(2m r²) + (3k n^2 r^2 )/(2 m).

Hmm, but then this is still a function of r, which is a variable, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can redefine the angular momentum term by introducing a new variable that combines r and θ. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the entire problem in terms of a product of functions, each depending on r and θ. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy spectrum. The options given are combinations of n_x and n_y, but wait, wait, no, the options have n_x and n_y as quantum numbers, but wait, in two dimensions, the quantum numbers are usually n_r (radial) and n_θ (angular), but perhaps the problem is using different quantum numbers.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: (2n_x + 3n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)
Option B: (n_x + 3n_y + 3/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)
Option C: (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)
Option D: (3n_x + 2n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)

Hmm, the energy seems to have terms linear in n_x and n_y multiplied by sqrt(k/m), which suggests that each direction contributes a harmonic oscillator term.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Let me try that.

The potential in Cartesian coordinates would be (since r^2 = x^2 + y^2, and cosθ = x/r). So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y^2).

Wait, because cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r².

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y²) )

Simplify: The second term becomes (3/2)k x².

So, V(x,y) = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x².

Combining like terms:

= (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y².

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Ah! Now that's a separable potential. That makes things easier. Because in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions.

So, in x-direction: harmonic oscillator with frequency sqrt(2k/m), because the potential is (1/2) m ω² x², where ω² = (2k/m), so ω = sqrt(2k/m).

In y-direction: harmonic oscillator with frequency sqrt(k/m), since potential is (1/2) m ω² y², ω² = k/m.

Wait, but wait: the potential in x is 2k x², so to write in standard form (1/2 m ω² x² ), we have (1/2 m ω² x² ) = 2k x².

So, 1/2 m ω² = 2k → ω² = 4k/m → ω = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, in y-direction: (1/2 m ω² y²) = (1/2)k y² → ω² = k/m → ω = sqrt(k/m).

So, the x and y directions are independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies 2 sqrt(k/m) and sqrt(k/m), respectively.

In quantum mechanics, the energy levels for each direction are quantized. For a harmonic oscillator in x, the energy is E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x. Similarly for y: E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

So, the total energy E is E_x + E_y.

Substituting the frequencies:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) = (2 n_x + 1) ħ sqrt(k/m) * (sqrt(4k/m) / sqrt(k/m)) ? Wait, wait, maybe better to compute ω_x and ω_y:

ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So, E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)).

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ (sqrt(k/m)).

Total energy E = E_x + E_y = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let's compute that:

E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m)

= [ 2 n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ħ sqrt(k/m)

= (2 n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, that's option C: (2n_x +n_y +3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos\theta = x/r \). Substituting these, the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k x^2.
   \]  
   Simplifying, this separates into:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This shows that the potential consists of two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

2. **Energy Quantization**:  
   For a harmonic oscillator in the \( x \)-direction, the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
   \]  
   Similarly, for the \( y \)-direction:  
   \[
   E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   The total energy is the sum of these contributions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, the correct match is:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to **Option C**.

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum of the particle is determined by the independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, leading to the energy expression in Option C.
