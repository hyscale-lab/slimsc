Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, photosphere and LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That probably means I should use the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states. The formula I remember is something like n_i over n_j equals (g_i/g_j) times exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is about the value of Boltzmann's constant k, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is equal to k multiplied by some temperature difference? Wait, no, because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, same as k. So maybe ΔE = k * T something.

Wait, the problem states that the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each star, the number of excited atoms is proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

Let me think: Let's denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as n1, and in star_2 as n2. According to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2.

Assuming that the ground state is much more populated, but since the question is about the ratio between the two excited states, maybe the ground state can be considered similar for both stars. Oh wait, no, because the problem is about the same energy level in each star. Hmm, maybe better to think in terms of the ratio of their populations.

Alternatively, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in each star would follow the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the lower state as j and the excited state as i. Then for each star, n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But if the ground state is much more populated, perhaps in this case, the g factors (statistical weights) are the same or the same for both stars, so they might cancel out.

Wait, the problem says it's the same specific energy level in each star. So the energy difference is the same for both stars. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach it step by step.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio n1 / n2 = 2.

Each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2. The Boltzmann factor for each is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star 1: n1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * n_j
For star 2: n2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * n_j'

Wait, but I'm assuming that the ground state populations are the same, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n1 / n2) is equal to (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ), assuming g factors are the same.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same (1.38e-23 J) for both stars. So ΔE is the same for both.

So the ratio n1 / n2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So [ exp(a) ] / [ exp(b) ] = exp(a - b). So here, a is -ΔE/(k T1), and b is -ΔE/(k T2). So a - b = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Given that n1/n2 is 2, so 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural log of both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, rearranging the terms:

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T_??? Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k) → (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting, ln(2) = (1 K) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, so that's ln(2) = (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1) ) ) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that matches.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. Because sometimes signs can be tricky. The ratio n1/n2 is 2. So n1 = 2 n2.

Using the Boltzmann factor for each star, the ratio n1/n2 is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Set this equal to 2: exp( ... ) = 2 → ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 −1/T1 )

Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k = 1 K. So yes, ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's option D.

Wait, look at the options. Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's correct. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the number of atoms in different energy states, given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the states, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star 1 and star 2, the ratio of excited to ground state populations is proportional to:

\[
\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) \bigg/ \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The problem states that the excited state in star 1 is twice as populated as in star 2, so \(\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = 2\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship.
