Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let's start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and their dimensions.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are dimensionless because they're just coefficients in the Dirac equation. So the structure of σ_{μν} doesn't change the dimension much; it's more about how the fields behave.

I think each field has a certain mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the dimension is 3/2 because in 4-dimensional spacetime, the action must be dimensionless. The Dirac Lagrangian is L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and the mass term has dimension 3. So ψ must have dimension (3-1)/2 = 1, wait no, wait, the mass term is m ψ̄ ψ, and m has dimension 1 in mass units. So ψ̄ ψ has dimension 3, so each ψ is dimension 3/2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4), the action has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have [term] = 4. For the kinetic term, i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So the term is [ψ]^2 [∂] = [ψ]^2 [1] = 4. Therefore, [ψ]^2 =4, so [ψ] = 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought ψ was 3/2. Hmm, I must be getting confused.

Wait, no, wait. Let's be precise. The fields have certain mass dimensions. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. Because the term ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension 4. Let me compute that: [ψ̄] is [ψ]^*, which is same as [ψ] = d. Then [ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ] = [ψ]^2 [∂] = d² * 1. So d² =4, so d=2? But wait, that can't be right because the mass term is m ψ̄ ψ. The mass m has dimension 1, so [m ψ̄ ψ] must be 4. So [ψ̄ ψ] = [m]^{-1} [Lagrangian term] ? Wait, no. The mass term is just part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4. So m ψ̄ ψ has dimension 4. [m] is 1, [ψ̄ ψ] must be 3, so each ψ is (3/2). So that's correct. So [ψ] is 3/2.

Wait, but the kinetic term is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [∂_mu] is 1, [ψ] is 3/2. So total dimension is 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4. Yes, that makes sense. So ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, looking back at the given Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2. ψ̄ is also 3/2. So the product ψ̄ ψ has dimension 3. Now σ_{μν} is [γ matrices], which are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} doesn't change the dimension. So the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) multiplied by F^{μν}.

What's F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So Aμ is a gauge field, which has mass dimension 1, because the term (∂μ Aν) must have dimension [A] + 1. But since F^{μν} is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. Wait, the Maxwell term is (1/4) F^{μν} F_{μν}, which must have dimension 4. So [F^2] =4. So [F] is 2. Because (F)^2 has dimension (2)(2)=4.

Wait wait, no, [F^{μν}] is [∂μ Aν], so A has dimension 1, because ∂ has dimension 1, and A is 1. So [F^{μν}] = [∂ A] = 1 +1=2. So F has dimension 2.

So going back to L_int: each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) =3.

Multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the whole term is (κ) * (3) * (2) = 4, because the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4.

Wait, no, because L is dimension 4. So each term in L must have dimension 4. So the product κ ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4.

So let's compute the dimensions: [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2)*2 + [F]. Wait, [ψ̄ σ ψ] = [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2)(dimensionless)(3/2) = (3/2)^2? Wait no, σ is built from [γ_μ, γ_ν], which are dimensionless, so [σ_{mu nu}] is 0. So [ψ̄ sigma psi] = [psi]^2 = (3/2)^2? Wait no, no, because [psi] is 3/2, [psi bar] is 3/2. So [psi bar sigma psi] = [psi bar][psi] = (3/2)^2. Wait, but that can't be right because that would give 9/4. But the Lagrangian term is [kappa] * [psi bar sigma psi] * [F] = [kappa] + (3/2 +3/2) + [F] = [kappa] +3 +2 = 5? But the term must be 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me recalculate:

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. The product ψ̄ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. So [ψ̄ ψ] =3.

But sigma_{mu nu} is made of gamma matrices, which don't contribute to the dimension. So [sigma_{mu nu}] is 0. So [ψ̄ sigma_{mu nu} psi] is [ψ̄] [sigma] [psi] = 3/2 + 0 +3/2 =3.

Then, F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So the term is κ * (3) * (2) = 6 [kappa].

But L must have dimension 4. So 6 [kappa] =4 → [kappa] =4/6 = 2/3. Wait, that can't be right. Because none of the options have 2/3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions. Let's try again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dimension of each term in the Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each factor:

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: dimensionless (since it's made of gammas, which are dim 0)

ψ: 3/2

F^{μν}: dimension of 2.

So the product: (3/2) * 1 * (3/2) * 2 = (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4)*2 = 9/2.

So the entire term is [κ] + (9/2) = 4 → [κ] =4 -9/2 = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.

Wait, but the options are about [kappa] being -1 or 1. Hmm, so my calculation gives [kappa] = -1/2. But none of the options match that. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I counted the dimensions incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the dimensions. Let me think about the term again.

The Lagrangian term is (κ) multiplied by (ψ̄ sigma_{mu nu} psi) multiplied by F^{mu nu}.

So the product (ψ̄ sigma psi) is a scalar (since sigma is antisymmetric and F is antisymmetric, but as a tensor product), but the dimension would be [ψ̄][sigma][psi].

But sigma is built from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [psi bar sigma psi] = [psi bar][psi] = 3/2 +3/2 =3.

So this part is dimension 3.

Then, F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So the product (3) * (2) =6. So the term is [kappa] *6 =4 → [kappa] =4/6=2/3. But again, that's not any of the options.

Wait, but the options have [kappa] being either -1 or 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the field dimensions.

Wait another approach: in four spacetime dimensions, the mass dimension of a coupling constant in a term is determined by requiring the Lagrangian has dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So our term is κ (ψ̄ σ ψ)(F). Let's compute the dimensions of (ψ̄ σ ψ) and F.

(ψ̄ σ ψ) is a scalar product. Since each ψ is (3/2), the product is (3/2) + (3/2) =3. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] =3.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. Its dimension is 2, as earlier.

So the term's dimension is [κ] +3 +2 = [κ]+5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah! Okay, that makes sense now. So [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant's mass dimension. In general, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have positive mass dimension (or zero), because that means the interaction terms have dimension less than or equal to 4, which are renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling determines the renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable only if the coupling has mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term).

Wait, no, more precisely, in 4 dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ (4 - sum of the fields' dimensions). Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, another approach: each interaction term must have a coupling with a mass dimension that is non-negative. Because for each interaction, the vertex must be dimensionless (if the theory is renormalizable in 4 dimensions), but in general, the mass dimension of the coupling is given by [g] = D - (sum of fields' dimensions), where D is the spacetime dimension. For renormalizability, [g] must be ≥ 0.

Wait, but 4 dimensions. So for a term like g ψ̄ σ ψ F, the sum of the fields' dimensions is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2=5. So [g] =4 -5= -1. So [g]=-1.

Wait, that would mean the coupling is dimensionful with negative mass dimension. Wait, a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is non-renormalizable because the interaction becomes weaker at higher energies. Wait, no, actually, the opposite. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, then the interaction term has positive mass dimension, meaning that the amplitude increases with energy, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, I think the rule is that a term with coupling of mass dimension d is renormalizable only if d ≥0. Because the coupling becomes less relevant (more irrelevant) as the energy increases, but if d is negative, the term becomes more relevant. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in terms of renormalizability, in 4D, the interaction term is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling is ≥ 0. Because for a term g ψ^n, in 4D, [g] =4 - (n × [ψ]) must be ≥0.

In this case, the interaction is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is a term with two ψs and one F. So the fields' dimensions are 3/2 (ψ̄) +3/2 (ψ) +2 (F) = 3 +2=5.

Wait, [Lagrangian term] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2 +3/2 +2) → [κ] +5. But [Lagrangian term] must be 4, so [κ] is -1.

So the coupling is dimension -1. Now, whether the theory is renormalizable depends on whether the coupling has non-negative mass dimension. Because if [g] is negative, the term has dimension higher than 4, implying non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, in 4D, the term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for the term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension such that [term] =4. So in this case, the term is allowed because κ is -1, and the rest sum to 5, so total is 4.

But wait, no. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension that allows the term to have dimension 4 in 4D. So for a term like ψ^m A^n, the coupling’s dimension is 4 - (m × [ψ] + n × [A]).

So in our case, the term is (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. So it's (ψ^2) F. So the fields contribute 2*(3/2) +2 =3 +2=5. So the coupling must have [κ] =4 -5 =-1.

Since [κ] is -1, which is less than zero, the term is non-renormalizable. Because the theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. In 4D, an interaction term is renormalizable only if the coupling has positive mass dimension or zero. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction becomes more significant at lower energies, which suggests that the theory is effective and only valid below a certain energy scale (the cutoff).

So in our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. Therefore, the interaction is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No.

B) [κ]=1 → No.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable → Yes.

D) [κ]=1, not → No.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimensions of the fields are:
- Dirac spinor $\psi$: $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- Field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$: $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = [\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$ (dimensionless, as it is built from $\gamma$ matrices).
- $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

Thus, the total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. A coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term has a dimension greater than 4, making the theory non-renormalizable. Such theories typically require an infinite number of counterterms and are only valid as effective field theories below a certain energy scale.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
