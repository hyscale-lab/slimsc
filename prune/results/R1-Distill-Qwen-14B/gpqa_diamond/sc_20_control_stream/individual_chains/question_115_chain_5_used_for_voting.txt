Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one in the upper-right and the other in the lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals total energy divided by rest mass energy. So the electron's gamma is 4, and the positron's gamma is 2. Since positrons are the antimatter counterparts of electrons, they have the same mass but opposite charge.

So first, I should calculate their energies and momenta. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 0.511 MeV, but maybe I can just work with units where c=1 and other constants are normalized for simplicity.

For the electron moving left to right: its Lorentz factor is gamma_e =4. So its energy E_e = gamma * m c². But since c=1, E_e =4m. Similarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so E_p =2m, but wait, wait. Wait, positron is moving from the right towards the collision point, so perhaps its direction is opposite to the electron's? Or wait, no—the problem says positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right), so in opposite directions.

Wait, that's crucial because their momenta would be opposite. So let me model their momenta.

Momentum p is gamma * m * v, but since for relativistic particles, p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, and with c=1, E² = p² + m². So for the electron: E_e =4m, so p_e = sqrt( (4m)^2 - m^2 ) = sqrt(16m² - m²) = sqrt(15 m²) = m√15. Similarly, the positron's energy is 2m, so p_p= sqrt( (2m)^2 -m^2 ) = sqrt(4m² -m²) = sqrt(3 m² )= m√3.

Wait, but wait—what's the direction of their momenta? The electron is moving left to right (positive x-direction), so p_e is positive. The positron is moving right to left, which is negative x-direction. So p_p is negative. So p_p = - m√3.

Now, when they collide and annihilate, they produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. Let me think about conservation laws here. The total energy and momentum before collision must equal those after.

So before collision, the total energy is E_e + E_p = 4m + 2m =6m.

The total momentum is p_e + p_p = m√15 (positive x) + (- m√3 ) (negative x) = m(√15 - √3 ). So directionally, √15 is about 3.87, √3 is about 1.732; so √15 - √3 ≈ 2.14, so positive. So net momentum is in the positive x-direction.

After the collision, two photons are emitted. Each photon has energy E_photon, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So they must form some angle θ above and below the x-axis, symmetric in a way, but the problem states that the directions measured are upper-right and lower-right. One in upper-right and another in lower-right. Wait, but since the total momentum must be conserved, the net momentum of the two photons should be equal to the initial momentum.

But since the photons are identical in energy, their directions must be such that their momenta add up vectorially to the initial momentum vector.

Each photon's momentum is equal in magnitude to their energy (since for photons, E = pc, and p = E/(c) which, with c=1, p=E). So each photon has momentum E_photon in their respective direction.

Wait, but the two photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum. Let me denote their momenta as vectors.

Let me consider the two photons as vectors. Let’s say photon 1 has momentum vector p1 = E (cos α, sin α ), and photon 2 has p2 = E (cos β, sin β ). But wait, their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps one has an angle α above the x-axis, and the other has an angle β below. But since both are moving to the right (as their directions are upper-right and lower-right), their x-components will be positive.

Wait, but because the initial system's momentum is in the positive x-direction, that makes sense.

So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial momentum.

So p_total_initial = m(√15 - √3 ) in x-direction, and zero in y-direction.

So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero. That is, p1y + p2y =0.

Since both photons have same energy E, their y-components are E sin α and E sin β.

So E sin α + E sin β =0 → sin α + sin β =0.

Which implies sin β = - sin α. So either β = -α, or β = π + α. But since both are moving in the right direction, their angles are measured from the x-axis towards positive y and negative y. So, for photon 1, α is say +θ, and photon 2, β is -θ. So their y-components are E sin θ and -E sin θ. So sum is zero.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, but with same magnitude. So their angles are θ and -θ.

So the sum of their momenta vectors would have x-components 2 E cos θ, and y-components canceling out.

Wait, but wait, the initial momentum is along x. So the sum of the y-components of the photons must be zero. That's already handled by making their angles symmetric.

Now, the sum of the x-components must equal the initial momentum.

So p_photon_total_x = 2 E cos θ = m (√15 - √3 )

But wait, the initial momentum was m (√15 - √3 ), which is a positive value. Let me compute that numerically.

√15 is about 3.872, √3 is about 1.732. So √15 - √3 ≈ 2.14. So m times that is m * 2.14.

So 2 E cos θ = m * 2.14.

But the total energy after collision is 2 E, since each photon has energy E, and there are two. But the total energy before collision is 6m. So 2E =6 m → E=3m.

Wait, that's a key point: energy conservation. The initial total energy is 6m, so the photons' total energy must be 6m. Since each photon has energy E_photon, 2 E_photon =6m → E_photon =3m.

Ah, so each photon has energy 3m. So substituting that into the previous equation:

2 (3m) cos θ = m (2.14) → 6 m cos θ = 2.14 m → cos θ = 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So θ = arccos(0.3567). Let me calculate that. Arccos(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(90)=0. So 69 is about the right ballpark.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, because in the initial setup, the positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m√15 (positive x) + (- m√3 ) (negative x). So that becomes m(√15 - √3 ), which is positive because √15 is bigger than √3. So that's correct.

Total energy before is E_e + E_p =4m +2m=6m. So after collision, the photons have total energy 6m, so each has E_photon=3m.

Then, the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta is 2 E cosθ, and that equals the initial momentum, which is m (√15 - √3 ) ≈ m * 2.14.

So 2 *3m cosθ = m *2.14 → 6m cosθ = 2.14 m → cosθ = 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So θ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but since each photon has angle θ above and below the x-axis, the angle between the two photons is 2θ. So 2 *69=138 degrees. So the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me compute cosθ more accurately.

(√15 - √3 ) = approx 3.872983 - 1.73205 = 2.140933.

So 2.140933 /6 = 0.356822.

So arccos(0.356822) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me calculate using a calculator approach.

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584. Which is very close to 0.3568. So indeed, θ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2θ, which is about 138 degrees. So the answer should be C) 138.

Wait, but let me think again about the momentum vectors. Each photon has momentum E (in magnitude) in direction θ and -θ.

So photon 1: E (cosθ, sinθ )

Photon 2: E (cosθ, -sinθ )

Adding the two, the y-components cancel, and the x-components add to 2 E cosθ.

Which equals the initial momentum, which is m (√15 -√3 ) ≈ 2.14 m.

So 2 E cosθ = 2.14 m.

E is 3m, so 2*3m * cosθ =2.14 m → 6 m cosθ =2.14 m → cosθ=2.14/6≈0.3567.

Which gives θ≈69 degrees as before.

So the angle between the two photons is 2θ=138 degrees. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the two photons, given that they have the same energy and one moves in the upper-right direction while the other in the lower-right direction.

### Step 1: Conservation of Energy
The total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. Using the Lorentz factor, the total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m + \gamma_p m = 4m + 2m = 6m
\]

After the collision, this energy is carried by the two photons. Since the photons have the same energy, each photon has energy:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m
\]

### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum before the collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and the positron. For relativistic particles, the momentum is given by:

\[
p = \sqrt{\gamma^2 m^2 - m^2}
\]

For the electron (\(\gamma_e = 4\)):

\[
p_e = \sqrt{4^2 m^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{15m^2} = m\sqrt{15}
\]

For the positron (\(\gamma_p = 2\)):

\[
p_p = \sqrt{2^2 m^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{3m^2} = m\sqrt{3}
\]

Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. Thus, the total momentum before the collision is:

\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m\sqrt{15} - m\sqrt{3} = m(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

### Step 3: Momentum of the Photons
After the collision, the two photons have equal energies and move in directions symmetric about the x-axis. Let the angle of one photon above the x-axis be \(\theta\), and the angle of the other photon below the x-axis be \(-\theta\). The momentum of each photon is equal to its energy (since \(E = pc\) for photons), and their directions are:

\[
\text{Photon 1: } p_1 = E_{\text{photon}} (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)
\]
\[
\text{Photon 2: } p_2 = E_{\text{photon}} (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta)
\]

The total momentum of the photons is:

\[
p_{\text{total, photons}} = p_1 + p_2 = 2E_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta \, (\hat{x})
\]

### Step 4: Equating Total Momentum
The total momentum before and after the collision must be equal. Thus:

\[
2E_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = m(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

Substitute \(E_{\text{photon}} = 3m\):

\[
2(3m) \cos\theta = m(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

Simplify:

\[
6m \cos\theta = m(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

Cancel \(m\):

\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
\]

Compute \(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732
\]
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140
\]

Thus:

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \(\theta\)
The angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ
\]

The angle between the two photons is:

\[
\text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta = 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
