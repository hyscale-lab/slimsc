Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to think it through.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is like a 3D version of a simple harmonic oscillator, so the energy levels are quantized.

The problem is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to figure out the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I recall that in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. For each dimension (x, y, z), the energy is (n_x + 1/2) ħω, where n_x is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). But since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so we can model it using the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but it's easier to think in terms of the total quantum number n, where n = nx + ny + nz. 

Wait, wait. Or is it the principal quantum number? Wait no, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So the energy E is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = nx + ny + nz. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and adding them up gives (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

So the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n can be 0,1,2,... So the ground state (n=0) is (3/2) ħω. The first excited state (n=1) is (5/2) ħω. Second excited (n=2) is (7/2) ħω, third excited is n=3, which gives (9/2) ħω. Oh, so the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) ħω. So looking at the options, the energy part would be either option A or C.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. So, the number of eigenfunctions (eigenstates) corresponding to a particular energy level. For a given n, how many states are there with the same energy E_n? Because the energy depends only on the sum n = nx + ny + nz, each set of (nx, ny, nz) that sums to the same n gives a different state, but same energy.

So the number of such states is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers. That's a combinatorics problem. For a given n, the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2), or (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = n is given by the combination formula C(n + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(n+2,2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2.

Wait, but wait. For the third excited state, n is 3. So the number of states would be (3 + 2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. So that's correct for both parts.

Wait, but let me double-check. The third excited state would correspond to the fourth energy level, right? Because the ground state is n=0 (first state), first excited n=1, second excited n=2, third excited n=3. So yes, n=3, E=(3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. And the number of states is (3 +2)(3 +1)/2? Wait, (n + 2)(n +1)/2? Wait n is 3, so (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2=10. Yeah, that's right.

So the correct option is A: (9/2) ħω, 10.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The energy of a state is given by:

\[
E_n = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is a non-negative integer. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second excited state to $n = 2$, and the third excited state to $n = 3$. For $n = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E_3 = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to a given energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of ways to write $n = 3$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Number of states} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

For $n = 3$, this becomes:

\[
\text{Number of states} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$.**
