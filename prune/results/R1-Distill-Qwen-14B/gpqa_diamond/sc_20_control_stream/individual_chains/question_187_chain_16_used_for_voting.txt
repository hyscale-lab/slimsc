Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I guess the key here is figuring out which stars meet that S/N threshold.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). I think it's known for its high efficiency and the ability to get good spectra even for fainter stars. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics of its performance.

Wait, the link provided might have given some details. Oh, right, from what I recall, ESPRESSO can reach a certain S/N for a given star's magnitude and exposure time. The V magnitude is important because it relates to the star's brightness as seen from Earth.

So, each option is a star with certain parameters. Let's list them out:

a) Canopus: I know Canopus is a very bright star. It's the second brightest star in the night sky, V magnitude around -0.7. So this should be easily detectable.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star, also quite bright. I think its V magnitude is about 1.95. So that's brighter than many stars, but not as bright as Canopus.

c) Star with V mag 15 at 10 pc: Wait, the question gives Absolute V magnitude (Mv) as 15 mag. So, the apparent magnitude (mv) depends on distance. The formula is mv = Mv + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So for 10 pc: mv =15 +5 +5*(1) → wait, is that right? Wait, log10(10) is 1. So 5*log10(10) is 5. So 15 +5 +5 =25? Wait, no: the formula is mv = Mv +5 log10 (d/10). So d=10: log(10/10)=0. So mv= Mv + 0 =15. So apparent magnitude is 15.

d) Same Mv 15, but distance 200 pc. So d=200, log(200/10)=log(20)=1.301. So mv=15 +5*1.301=15+6.505=21.505. So apparent magnitude about 21.5.

e) Mv 15, distance 5 pc. So d=5, log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.301. So mv=15 -1.505 ≈13.495.

f) Mv 15, distance 50 pc. d=50, log(50/10)=1.69897. So 5*1.699 =8.495. mv=15+8.495=23.495.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the formula. Oh yes, the correct formula is mv = Mv +5 log10(d) -5. Because Mv is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 parsecs. So, for any distance d in parsecs, mv = Mv +5*(log10(d) -1) → which is the same as Mv +5*log10(d/10).

So for each case:

c) d=10: log10(10/10)=0 → mv=15+0=15.

d) d=200: log10(200/10)=log10(20)=1.301 → mv=15 +5*1.301=15+6.505=21.505.

e) d=5: log10(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.301 → mv=15 +5*(-0.301)=15-1.505=13.495.

f) d=50: log10(50/10)=1.699 → mv=15+5*1.699=15+8.495=23.495.

Now, I need to figure out which of these stars would have an S/N of at least 10 with ESPRESSO in 1 hour.

I remember that the S/N ratio depends on the brightness of the star. The fainter the star (higher apparent magnitude), the lower the S/N. Also, higher exposure time increases S/N, but here it's fixed at 1 hour.

ESPRESSO's performance is such that it can achieve a given S/N for a star of a certain magnitude in a certain exposure time. I think the standard performance curve for ESPRESSO's spectrograph is that it can reach S/N per pixel of about 10 for a V magnitude around 19 in 1 hour, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers.

Wait, another approach: I should probably look up the ESPRESSO S/N per hour vs magnitude. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to reach S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for bright stars (like V=8) in a few minutes. But for fainter stars, it's less. So for a 1-hour exposure, maybe it can reach lower magnitudes.

Wait, I found a paper or a document once that stated that ESPRESSO can reach S/N of about 10 per pixel for stars around V=20 in 1 hour. So if a star's apparent magnitude is about 20, then S/N=10 after 1 hour.

Wait, another thought: the formula for S/N is generally proportional to sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4*(mv - mv0)), where mv0 is the magnitude at which S/N is 1 per second. Or maybe the formula is S/N = k * (exposure time) * 10^(-0.4*(mv - mv0)), with k being some constant.

Alternatively, I found that for ESPRESSO, the expected S/N per hour for a star is given by a certain relation. Let me think: I once read that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N~10 for V=19 in 1 hour. So if that's the case, any star with mv ≤19 would have S/N ≥10, and mv>19 would be below.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is even fainter. So if a star has an apparent magnitude of, say, 20, then S/N would be lower than 10.

Wait, let's think about the numbers. Let's say for a star of V=19, S/N is 10 in 1 hour. Then for a star at V=20, since each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness, S/N would decrease by sqrt(2.512) ≈1.585. So 10 /1.585 ≈6.3. So at V=20, S/N would be ~6.3, which is below 10. So that star would not be detectable.

Wait, but how exactly does the S/N scale with magnitude?

The S/N ratio is proportional to the square root of the number of photons collected, which in turn depends on the star's flux. Since flux decreases with magnitude by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude, the S/N ratio (which scales with sqrt(flux)) would decrease by sqrt(2.512) per magnitude.

So, if S/N is 10 at V=19, then for each magnitude brighter, S/N increases by sqrt(2.512), and for each magnitude fainter, it decreases by the same factor.

So, for a star at V=20, S/N would be 10 / sqrt(2.512) ≈10/1.585≈6.3, which is below 10.

Similarly, V=18: S/N=10 * sqrt(2.512)≈15.85.

So, in our options, which stars have mv ≤19?

Let's list the mv for each option:

a) Canopus: V mag is about -0.7 → definitely brighter than 19.

b) Polaris: V mag 1.95 → way brighter than 19.

c) mv=15 → way brighter than 19 → S/N would be way higher than 10.

d) mv≈21.5 → worse than 19. So S/N would be 10*(2.512)^((19-21.5)/2.5). Wait, maybe a better way: the formula is S/N ∝ 10^(-0.4*(mv - mv0)), where mv0 is the magnitude at which S/N is 10. So, if mv0 is 19, then for mv=21.5, the S/N would be 10 * 10^(-0.4*(21.5-19)) =10 * 10^(-0.4*2.5) → 10^(-1) → 10 * (0.1) =1. So S/N=1. So way below 10.

e) mv≈13.5 → much brighter than 19. So S/N would be more than 10.

f) mv≈23.5 → way fainter, so S/N would be 10 * (10^(-0.4*(23.5-19))) = 10 * 10^(-0.4*4.5) → 10^( -1.8) → approximately 0.158. So S/N≈1.58, below 10.

So, which stars have mv ≤19? Let's see:

a) mv=-0.7 → yes.

b) mv=1.95 → yes.

c) mv=15 → yes.

d) mv=21.5 → no.

e) mv≈13.5 → yes.

f) mv≈23.5 → no.

So the stars a, b, c, e are detectable (mv ≤19), d and f are not.

Wait, but wait a second. How about the distances? Are all these stars within the observable range of the VLT? Oh, but the question says 'located at' certain distances, but the VLT can observe stars up to very far, so distance shouldn't be a problem except maybe for how bright they appear.

So, stars a, b, c, e would have S/N ≥10, and d, f would be too faint.

Wait, but wait: for option c, mv=15, which is much brighter than 19, so S/N would be much higher than 10.

Wait, but wait, I'm assuming that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N=10 at V=19. But I'm not 100% sure about that number. Let me think again.

I think ESPRESSO has a certain baseline performance. According to the ESO website, ESPRESSO is designed to reach S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for V=8 stars in a few minutes. So for a 1-hour exposure, it can go much deeper.

Wait, another approach: the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. For a given star, if you have 10 S/N in 1 hour, then in 1 hour, that's the same as the question says. But I need to think about the instrumental performance.

Alternatively, I found a resource that says: "ESPRESSO is capable of reaching an S/N ratio of 100 per pixel for a V=8 star in 3 minutes, and it can achieve a S/N of 10 per pixel for a V=20 star in one hour."

Wait, if that's the case, then any star with mv ≤20 would have S/N ≥10 in 1 hour. So, stars with mv ≤20 would be detectable.

Let me check the mvs again:

a) -0.7 → detectable.

b) 1.95 → detectable.

c) 15 → detectable.

d) 21.5 → above 20 → not detectable.

e) 13.5 → detectable.

f) 23.5 → not detectable.

So that's four stars: a, b, c, e.

Wait, but wait, option e is at 5 pc and Mv=15, so mv=13.5. That's way brighter than 20. So S/N would be much higher than 10.

So according to this, four stars are detectable: a, b, c, e.

But wait, I thought I read that for mv=20, S/N=10. So stars brighter than 20 (like 15, 13.5) would have higher S/N.

So the stars with mv ≤20 are a,b,c,e. So four stars.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be C)4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Polaris (option b) has V mag 1.95. But I'm not sure whether Polaris is a variable star or if the V mag is sometimes different. But the question states it's a specific value, so I'll go with that.

Also, note that the RA and DEC for options c, d, e, f are all RA=0, DEC=0, which is the same as the VLT's location, I think. So they would be at the zenith, which is the best possible position, so the exposure would be optimal.

So the detectable stars are a, b, c, e. So four stars.

But wait, looking back at the options, the choices are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

So option C is 4. So the answer should be C.

To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude ($m_v$) of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where $M_v$ is the absolute magnitude and $d$ is the distance in parsecs. A star is detectable if its $m_v \leq 20$, as ESPRESSO is designed to achieve an S/N of 10 for stars with $m_v \approx 20$ in 1 hour.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Canopus (a)**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of approximately $m_v = -0.7$. Since this is much brighter than $m_v = 20$, it is easily detectable.

2. **Polaris (b)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of $m_v = 1.95$. This is also much brighter than $m_v = 20$, so it is detectable.

3. **Star c**: This star has $M_v = 15$ and is located at $d = 10$ pc. Using the formula:
   \[
   m_v = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 0 = 15
   \]
   Since $m_v = 15$ is much brighter than $m_v = 20$, this star is detectable.

4. **Star d**: This star has $M_v = 15$ and is located at $d = 200$ pc. Using the formula:
   \[
   m_v = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 = 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 21.505
   \]
   Since $m_v = 21.505$ is fainter than $m_v = 20$, this star is not detectable.

5. **Star e**: This star has $M_v = 15$ and is located at $d = 5$ pc. Using the formula:
   \[
   m_v = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 = 15 + 5(-0.301) - 5 = 13.495
   \]
   Since $m_v = 13.495$ is much brighter than $m_v = 20$, this star is detectable.

6. **Star f**: This star has $M_v = 15$ and is located at $d = 50$ pc. Using the formula:
   \[
   m_v = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 = 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 23.495
   \]
   Since $m_v = 23.495$ is fainter than $m_v = 20$, this star is not detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), and stars c and e. This gives a total of **4 detectable stars**.
