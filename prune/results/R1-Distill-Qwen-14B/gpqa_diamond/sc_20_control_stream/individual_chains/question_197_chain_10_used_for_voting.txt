Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a product formed after a reaction. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A to D. The data given are IR and NMR spectra of Compound X. Hmm, right, so first, I should probably analyze the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is, and then determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data: strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm-1. That usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The peaks at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid). The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and maybe some substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, which fits here. So maybe a COOH group?

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, so that fits. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm probably confirms that. So, maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group?

Wait, but let me check the other parts. The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, doublet (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet, but lower down, which suggests perhaps para substitution on the benzene ring.

So, maybe the aromatic ring is para-substituted. So, two substituents on para positions. Wait, but how many? Let me think. The H NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, if you have a substituent in the para position, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each with two protons. So, the substituents are probably in the para positions.

But wait, what substituents? Let me think. In a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are across from each other. So, the aromatic region in NMR shows two doublets of 2H each, so that's a total of 4H. That would make sense if the substituents on the benzene are in the para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So, the substituents on the benzene are probably in para positions. Now, what are they? Let's look at the other peaks in the NMR.

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, integrating for 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen or maybe a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH adjacent to a branching, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, but in a carbonyl group, like a ketone, the adjacent CH would be around 2.1-2.6 ppm. Hmm, but this is 2.9, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's part of an isopropyl group attached to something else.

Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, multiplet. That could be adjacent to a branching point. Maybe part of a chain, like CH2 next to a CH or branching.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet? Wait, 3H as a doublet suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. A common scenario is a tert-butyl group, but wait, that's usually a singlet because all the methyl groups are equivalent. Alternatively, if it's a methyl attached to a CH that's split by neighboring protons. Wait, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group. For example, in a sec-butyl group, the methyl would be attached to a CH, which would cause splitting. Or maybe it's part of an isopropyl group.

Wait, 1.4 ppm is a bit low for a methyl group. More likely, it's a methyl attached to something. The d (doublet) suggests that the methyl is adjacent to a CH group, which is split into a doublet by another proton. So, perhaps a structure like CH(CH3)CH2-.

The last peak is at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. This is typical of a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group. A triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2 group. So, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together: The NMR suggests an aromatic ring with substituents, a carbonyl group (probably carboxylic acid given IR), some branching in the chain attached to the ring, and a terminal ethyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, that peak would be about right. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. So, that would make sense. So, the compound has a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring, and another substituent in the para position.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. If the benzene has two substituents in para positions, perhaps one is a COOH group and the other is something else.

Wait, but how does that fit with the other NMR signals?

Looking at the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and 1.7 ppm (m,2H): That seems like a chain of CH-CH2- something. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, perhaps as in CH(CH3), and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl (CH2CH3).

So, putting this together: perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group in one para position and a substituent that's a chain leading to a terminal ethyl group. The substituent would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or similar.

Wait, but let's think about the chain. Let's build it. Let's say the substituent is a propyl group attached via a branching. Let's consider the NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): Maybe a CH group connected to a carbonyl. Wait, but wait, if it's a COOH, maybe the chain is attached to the ring via the carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzene with a COCH2CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that might not explain the 2.9 ppm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH3. So, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a branching point.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But that would make the chain longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would show the CH group (maybe the 2.9 ppm peak), the CH2 (1.7 ppm), and the terminal methyl (0.9 ppm). The methyl attached to the CH would be at around 1.4 ppm as a doublet (since it's adjacent to the CH group, which is split by neighboring protons).

Wait, let's draw this substituent:

- The benzene ring has a substituent that's a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but where is the connection? Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's a different branching.

Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would not give the right branching.

Alternatively, substituent is -(CH2)CH2CH(CH3). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. But that's a tertiary structure.

Wait, let me think again. The substituent attached to the benzene would have a chain that includes a CH group that's split into a multiplet (2.9 ppm, 1H), then a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), and a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet). The methyl at 1.4 ppm (d,3H) must be attached to the CH group, making the structure something like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. So, that's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Actually, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2, which is an isobutyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, but that's a secondary carbon. So, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene ring. But that's only a two-carbon chain. No, wait, a butyl group is four carbons. So, maybe the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, think of the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a four-carbon chain with a branch, but perhaps that's not the right structure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to figure out the structure based on the NMR.

So, the aromatic region suggests para-substituted benzene, perhaps with a substituent in one position and another group in the para. Wait, but the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So, substituents in para positions. Let's say substituents are X and Y, each in para positions.

But wait, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). The upfield protons (7.2 ppm) are probably adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So, if one substituent is a carbonyl group (like COOH), that would de-shield the adjacent aromatic protons, making them appear downfield. So, the 8.0 ppm would be the protons ortho to the COOH group, and the 7.2 ppm would be the ones ortho to the other substituent, which is perhaps an electron-donating group.

So, the substituents are probably a COOH group and an isopropyl or ethyl group, but given the NMR, more likely a substituent with a chain leading to an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a way that gives the NMR signals.

Wait, another approach: The NMR has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d,3H). That's a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is then attached to another CH2 or something.

So, maybe the structure is benzene with a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH2CH3). But that would only be three carbons, making it a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reactions. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but wait, another reaction: maybe a Birch reduction? No, Birch is with sodium and NH3 in ethanol. Alternatively, using HI and red phosphorus is for the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and heat, then strong base. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, wait, another reaction: when a carbonyl group (like ketone, aldehyde) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes an elimination reaction, perhaps forming an alkene via the elimination of H2O or HX.

Wait, no, maybe it's the reduction of esters or acids. Oh! Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. Because in the presence of HI and P, the carboxylic acid is first converted to an acid chloride, and then reduced. Or wait, is it more of a Clemmensen-like reduction? Clemmensen is for ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI is used for the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would convert it to a hydrocarbon. Let me think: when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it typically gets reduced to a hydrocarbon. For example, RCOOH + HI (excess) → RCH2I? Or RCH2- something? Wait, perhaps it's more like a two-step process: first, the acid is converted to an acyl chloride with PCl5 or something, but in this case, maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a deoxygenation, converting the carboxylic acid into an alkane. So, the COOH group becomes a CH2 group. Because, for example, RCOOH → RCH3 via some reduction.

Wait, but how does that fit with the options provided?

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid — that's a benzoic acid derivative.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene — that's a toluene derivative with substituents.

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid — another benzoic acid.

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene — another toluene derivative.

Wait, so options B and D are substituted toluenes, while A and C are benzoic acids.

So, if the starting material is a benzoic acid (so options A or C), and the reaction reduces the COOH to something else, perhaps a CH3 group.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with excess HI and red phosphorus, it gets converted to a bromide? Or perhaps a substitution occurs. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of an acyl chloride followed by something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile with red phosphorus and HI. But wait, the starting material doesn't seem to have a nitrile. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: considering the IR data, the 1720 cm-1 peak could be an ester or a ketone. Earlier, I thought it was a carboxylic acid, but maybe it's an ester.

If the IR's 1720 is an ester, then the 10.5 ppm peak might not be a carboxylic acid but perhaps an alcohol or something else. Wait, but 10.5 is quite high for an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually sharp singlets. The 10.5 is a broad singlet, so more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a phenyl ester. For example, methyl benzoate would have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, and the aromatic protons would be as in the NMR.

But that doesn't fit the NMR data because in the case of methyl benzoate, the aromatic protons would be different. Let me think: benzoate esters usually have the aromatic protons as two doublets, but the substituents would be the ester group. Wait, but in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H), which suggests two substituents in the para positions, but maybe one is an ester and the other is a substituent.

Alternatively, if the substituents are an ester group and another group, like an isopropyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. But the NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a methyl attached to a CH group, which is then attached to another CH2, and then a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a propyl group with a branch. Let me imagine:

Benzene ring with a substituent in para position. The substituent is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's four carbons, so it's a butyl group.

Alternatively, it's a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, perhaps that's a 3-pentyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's an isobutyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm not getting it clearly.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, that's a pentyl group with branching.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. If the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, I recall that HI can act as a nucleophile. In the presence of red phosphorus, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride followed by something else.

Wait, another thought: the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could be a hydrolysis, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is being converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the reduction of a carboxylic acid to a hydrocarbon. For example, RCOOH → RCH3. How? Using LiAlH4 would reduce a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, but not all the way to a hydrocarbon.

Wait, but I think that using HI and red phosphorus can deoxygenate the carboxylic acid. For example, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) can be converted to a CH2 group. So, RCOOH → RCH3.

Wait, but wait, let's see. The starting material has a COOH group, and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes RCH3. So, the product would have a CH3 group where the COOH was.

So, if the starting material is 4-(substituent)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-(substituent)toluene, but that's not exactly right. Wait, more accurately, the product would be a toluene derivative where the COOH group is replaced by a CH3.

Wait, but in the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group in position 1 and a methyl in position 4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let me clarify: in benzene rings, the positions are numbered based on substituents. So, if the starting material has a COOH group at position 4 and a substituent in position 1, after reduction, the COOH becomes CH3, so the product would have a CH3 in position 4 and the substituent in position 1.

But I'm not sure about the substituent's structure. Let's think about the substituent.

Looking back at the NMR data, the substituent attached to the benzene (assuming the COOH is in position 4) would be in position 1. The substituent's structure would be some kind of butyl group.

The substituent's NMR signals are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

So, let's model this substituent.

Starting from the terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t), it's connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m), which is connected to a CH (2.9 ppm, m), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d). So, the chain is:

CH2CH3 - CH2 - CH(CH3) - [attached to benzene]

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group? Let me count: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's too long. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's a isobutyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 ppm (d). The CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m), and the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m), which is a bit high, but possible if it's near an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a 2-methylpropyl group, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the substituent's NMR shows a CH that's next to a CH2 and a CH3.

Structure: CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, putting it together:

The substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the next part is CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? That would be a pentyl group, but the NMR only shows up to the CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2, which is an isobutyl group. Let me see: the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the methyl groups, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests that the methyl is attached to a CH that's split by neighboring protons. In isobutyl, the CH is connected to two methyl groups, which would make the CH's protons a septet, but that's not what the NMR shows.

Wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests that the methyl group is attached to a CH that's split by one neighboring proton. So, perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch at the second carbon. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that's a four-carbon substituent, which is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe it's a 3-methylbutyl group. Structure: CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2- attached to the ring. But that would have a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, which is an isopropyl group attached via a CH2.

Wait, but the NMR data suggests a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), and a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d) connected to the CH.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH2 and then a CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. But that's a six-carbon chain, which seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So, that's a four-carbon substituent (butyl group) with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group. Let me think: the structure would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, that's a four-carbon substituent where the second carbon has a methyl branch. That would be a 2-methylpropyl group, but I'm not sure about the terminology.

Alternatively, it's a 3-pentyl group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the product after the reaction. If the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction converts the COOH to CH3, then the product would be a toluene derivative with the substituent.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene has a methyl group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position 1.

If the starting material was 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH would be converted to CH3. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (option D).

Wait, that makes sense. So, the starting compound is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), which after reaction becomes option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene).

But wait, I should double-check the reaction conditions. Does red phosphorus and HI reduce a benzoic acid to toluene?

I think that red phosphorus and HI can be used to deoxygenate carboxylic acids, converting them into alkanes. For example, the reaction RCOOH + excess HI and red phosphorus → RCH3.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, the product would be option D.

Wait, but let me confirm the reaction. Another possibility is that the reaction is a hydrolysis or some substitution, but I think the deoxygenation is more likely.

So, putting it all together, the starting material is option C, and after reaction, it becomes option D. So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The spectral data provided for Compound X is analyzed as follows:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a branching point.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, suggesting a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, typical of a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃) as substituents. This matches **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes via deoxygenation. Thus, the -COOH group in Compound X is converted to a methyl group (-CH₃). The resulting product is a para-substituted benzene ring with a methyl group (-CH₃) and a sec-butyl group as substituents. This corresponds to **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Conclusion:
The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)**, and the final product after the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Option D)**.

Answer: D
