Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and break it down step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, so I'll need to think this through.

First, let me outline the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid (like HCl, H2SO4), and G is a weak acid (like acetic acid, HCN).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. I need to figure out what these substances could be. Let's start by considering possible reactions.

The first reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and used in large amounts, maybe B is something like O2, Cl2, or another diatomic gas. The product C is bright red, which is a clue. I remember that some metal sulfides or oxides are red, but more importantly, certain metal oxides when combined with other elements can form colored compounds.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is chlorine gas (Cl2). If A is a metal, say copper, then reacting with Cl2 might form CuCl2, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, if A is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a formation of a complex or something else.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to give A plus two acids F and G. So, C is likely a compound that, when hydrolyzed, breaks down into A and two acids. For example, maybe a metal chloride hydrolyzes into a metal hydroxide (or oxide) and HCl, but the presence of two different acids suggests that perhaps C has two different anions.

Wait, wait. Let's think of a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. One of them is strong, the other weak. For example, suppose C is a salt that contains two different anions. When it reacts with water, each anion could form its respective acid. So, maybe C is a nitride or some other compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with water to produce carbon (or another element) and some acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Wait, but sulfide reactions tend to produce H2S, which is a gas, but we have two acids here.

Wait, another angle: looking at reaction 2, C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. D and B forming H, which is a solvent—maybe H is something like H2O, but B is a gas, so perhaps B is H2 and D is O2? Then H would be H2O. Wait, but D and B would be H2 and O2, which in a 1:1 ratio form H2O, which is a solvent. That's a possibility.

Wait, but D reacting with B to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B would be O2 and H2, which react to form H2O. But that's a possible scenario.

So if B is H2, then reaction 1 is A + 8 H2 → C. What would A be then? Maybe A is something that reacts with hydrogen in a high ratio. Perhaps a transition metal. For example, iron reacting with H2 in some context. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Then, reaction 1 would be A + 8 Cl2 → C. What if A is copper metal? 2 Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2 (but that's 1:1 ratio, not 8). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state with Cl. For example, maybe it's a reaction like aluminum reacting with Cl2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, let's think about the products. C, when reacted with water, gives A plus two acids. So if C is a chloride, perhaps it's a mixture of different chlorides. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex ion, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something like: A is carbon. B is oxygen. 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with carbon to form CO? But that's only 1 O2 per C, so 8 O2 would mean 8 * 2 = 16 O atoms. But carbon and O2 reacting to form CO would be 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. Again, not matching 8 equivalents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous, so maybe it's something like phosgene (but I'm not certain), or perhaps something like dioxin, but more likely, it's a common hazardous compound.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with D to form E, and D is a gas. So perhaps D is something like Cl2 or another halogen. C could be a metal carbide, as they can react with halogens. Hmm.

Wait, going back to the fourth reaction: D + B → H, which is a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like H2O, ethanol, or something else. But if H is a product of D and B, and B is a gas, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, forming H2O as solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else.

Wait, let's consider D and B producing H as a solvent. Suppose B is O2 and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else. But that might not fit as well.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the product E. It's produced when C reacts with D. E is extremely hazardous. So E might be a toxic gas, or a highly reactive compound.

Wait, let's think of possible reactions where C and D form E. Perhaps D is Cl2, and C is a metal oxide, leading to some acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to outline each reaction with possible compounds. Let me make a table:

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (solid to gas reaction, product is solid C)

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G weak acid)

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

Let me try to find possible compounds.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1.

Possible H: H2O, ethanol, NH3, etc. If H is H2O, then D and B could be O2 and H2.

Wait, for example:

If B is H2 (gas), D is O2 (gas). Then D + B → H2O (solvent, H). But H2O is a solvent, so that's possible.

So then:

Reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O (H is H2O)

If that's the case, D is O2, B is H2.

Then Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C.

What's A reacting with H2 in 8 equivalents? Maybe A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. For example, consider a metal that forms a hydride or some compound with H2.

Wait, another way: perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is a metal oxide, and H2 is a reducing agent.

Wait, but 8 H2 would mean 8 moles of H2 per mole of A. That's a lot. Maybe A is a metal in a high oxidation state, like Fe^3+ or something else.

Wait, when a metal reacts with H2, it might form a metal hydride. For example, sodium reacts with H2 to form NaH. But sodium hydride is a strong base. But in this case, perhaps with 8 H2 per A, maybe a more complex reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and the reaction is something like A + H2 → AH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when A is a metal and reacts with H2 in high amounts, it could form a complex. Alternatively, maybe it's not a metal but a non-metal, like sulfur. Sulfur reacts with H2 in the presence of a catalyst to form H2S, but that's a gas, and C is a solid, so that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps B isn't H2. Let me think of another possibility.

What if B is Cl2? Then in reaction 1: A + 8 Cl2 → C.

What could A be? If A is a metal, perhaps it's reacting with Cl2 to form a chloride. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions, but the stoichiometry may not match. Let's see: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So, 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. But here, it's 8 Cl2 per 1 A. So maybe A is a metal that forms a higher chloride, like PbCl4?

Wait, another possibility: A is a metal that forms a complex when reacted with Cl2. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a chloro compound with multiple Cl atoms.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

Since F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt of two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite or something else that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids.

Wait, another thought: if C is a mixed salt, like a metal carbonate reacting with water? No, because carbonate would produce CO2 and a hydroxide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with water to produce HCl and SiO2? Wait, SiC + H2O → SiO2 + CH4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 and Ca(OH)2. But that's not two acids.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)S (or Fe(OH)2/Fe(OH)3) and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So if F is a strong acid, perhaps another component is involved.

Wait, but how would C produce two acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe C is a salt containing two different anions that each form an acid. For example, a salt like NH4Cl and another acid. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps C is a double salt, like Ca(ClO)Cl. Upon hydrolysis, it could produce HCl and HClO. HCl is a strong acid, and HClO is a weak acid (but not as weak as something like acetic acid, though). Alternatively, maybe the salt is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce two different acids. But most metal oxides either produce a single acid (like Na2O → 2 NaOH) or don't react (like SiO2, which is inert). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, AlN reacts with water to produce NH3 and Al(OH)3. But again, that gives a base and a hydroxide, not acids.

Another possibility: C is a mixed carbonate, like calcium carbonate, but that produces CO2 and a hydroxide upon reaction with water. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonyl. For example, perhaps nickel carbonyl, but I don't see how that would give two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxynitride or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps C is a metal chloride that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and another acid. For example, if C is a mixture of chlorides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think of the products when C reacts with D. If D is Cl2, and C is a metal, then E could be a higher chloride. For example, if C is FeCl2, reacting with Cl2 might form FeCl3. But E is extremely hazardous, which suggests maybe it's a more dangerous compound.

Wait, another idea: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like phosgene (but that's COCl2), or maybe something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small quantities. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe E is a product of a reaction between C and D that's explosive or highly toxic. For example, if C is a metal sulfide and D is Cl2, perhaps they react to form SO2 and metal chloride, but SO2 is toxic, but I'm not sure if that's E.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide reacting with D (Cl2) to form an acid (like HCl), but that's probably not E.

Wait, perhaps E is a dioxin or something, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a result of a substitution reaction. Let's think about D and C.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride and D is a stronger acid, which would displace something. Or maybe C is a halide that reacts with another halogen.

Hmm, perhaps C is a chloride, and D is another halogen like F2, which could cause some displacement. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is Cl2, leading to SO2 and metal chloride. But let's see.

Wait, another angle: the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

I'm a bit rusty on my point groups. Let me recall:

- C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis. Symmetrical along that axis.

- D4h: dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and reflections. High symmetry.

- D∞h: infinite dihedral, like a cylinder with many mirror planes and rotational symmetry.

- C2v: has a 2-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So which of these would E have?

If E is something like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If E is something like phosgene (O=CCl2), what's its symmetry? Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two Cl atoms. Its point group is D∞h because it has a C∞ axis perpendicular to the Cl atoms, and mirror planes.

But I'm not certain if that's the case, but let's see.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is bent (like O=C=O), but SO2 has a D∞h symmetry as well. Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2 axis, so its point group is D2h or C2v? Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2 axis (the axis through the sulfur and the midpoint between the two oxygens), and two mirror planes (each containing the axis and one of the O atoms). So its point group is D2h or perhaps C2v. Wait, I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible E. If E is something like phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a structure where the central carbon is bonded to an O (double bond) and two Cl atoms. The molecule has a C2v symmetry because it has a mirror plane through the C=O bond and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to that.

Wait, no, phosgene is more accurately described as having D∞h symmetry because it's a planar molecule with a C∞ axis. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up different molecules.

Wait, another way: if E is something like dioxane, which has a D4h symmetry. But dioxane is a solvent, not a product of a reaction that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but let's think about what E could be. If E is a linear molecule, then it would have D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a C2 symmetry, like H2O, which has a C2 symmetry when looking down the axis (but actually, H2O has a C2v symmetry because of the two mirror planes and a C2 axis).

Wait, perhaps E is HCl, but that's a simple molecule with C∞v symmetry. But HCl is a gas, and E is extremely hazardous, which might fit.

Alternatively, if E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxetane), which is a highly toxic compound. But I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should go back to the reactions.

Let me try to outline all reactions with possible substances.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio). Let's assume H is water (H2O). Then D and B must combine to form H2O. So if B is H2 and D is O2, then H is H2O. So B is H2, D is O2.

So in reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O.

Now, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (solid).

So A is a solid that reacts with H2 in 8 equivalents. Let me think of a metal that reacts with H2 in such a high ratio. For example, maybe it's a metal that forms a complex hydride. Or perhaps it's a non-metal like sulfur reacting in a high ratio.

Wait, another possibility: A is carbon, and the reaction is a combustion reaction, but that would require O2, which is not the case here. Or maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe3O4, and H2 is the reducing agent. The reaction would be Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and H2O. But that doesn't produce a solid C. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. Let's say A is CrO3 (a solid). Reacting with H2: CrO3 + H2 → Cr + H2O. But how many equivalents? Let me see.

CrO3 has the formula CrO3. The reaction would need to balance:

CrO3 + H2 → Cr + H2O.

Let's balance it. CrO3 → Cr (reduction: Cr from +6 to 0 oxidation state). H2 is oxidized to H2O (oxidation from 0 to +1).

So each H2 provides 2 H's. Let's see:

CrO3 + 3 H2 → Cr + 3 H2O.

That's 3 equivalents of H2. But in our problem, it's 8 equivalents, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe A is a different compound. Let me think. What if A is a metal that forms a complex with H2? For example, sodium in H2 forms NaH, but the stoichiometry would be 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a high valency, like OsO4. OsO4 + H2 → Os + H2O.

Wait, OsO4 has the formula OsO4. Let's write the reaction:

OsO4 + H2 → Os + 2 H2O.

Balancing:

OsO4 → Os^0, so each Os goes from +8 to 0. So 4 H2O are produced, but let's balance:

OsO4 + 2 H2 → Os + 4 H2O.

So, 2 H2 per OsO4. That's 2 equivalents. But our reaction uses 8 equivalents, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let me think of C. C is a solid that reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

Suppose C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, maybe it's a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is KCN and HCl, but that's not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixed carbonate, but I’m not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal chloride. For instance, if C is a mixture of chlorides, but that doesn't immediately suggest two acids.

Wait, if C is a metal carbonate, perhaps it would produce CO2 and a hydroxide, but that's not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixture of chlorides and another anion.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. H2S is a weak acid. So if F is a strong acid, perhaps the other product is HCl. But where would Cl come from? Unless C has Cl in it.

Wait, perhaps C is FeS and also contains Cl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro-sulfide, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like SiC. SiC reacts with water to produce CH4 and H2SiO3 (which is a weak acid, but I'm not sure if it's considered a strong acid). Alternatively, perhaps another carbide.

Wait, another angle: if C reacts with water to produce a strong acid F and a weak acid G, perhaps F is HCl and G is HCN. To get HCl and HCN, C must contain Cl and CN groups. But then, what would C be?

Wait, perhaps C is CuCNCl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide and a chloride salt. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide and a metal chloride, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about E again. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound. For example, phosgene (O=CCl2) is a toxic gas. What's its molecular symmetry?

Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar, with a C=O double bond. The point group is D∞h because it has an infinite axis of rotation (C∞), a mirror plane (σh), and other symmetry elements.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, how does that fit into the reactions? Let me try to piece it together.

Suppose C is something that when reacted with D (which is O2) produces phosgene. Let's see: C + 2 O2 → phosgene (O=CCl2) + ... ?

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that upon reaction with O2 forms phosgene. Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated hydrocarbon.

Wait, another approach: if D is O2 and C is CCl4, then C + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 Cl2. But that's not phosgene.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CH2Cl2, which when reacted with O2 could form phosgene, but I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to think of another possibility for E.

Another extremely hazardous compound is sarin gas, but that's an organophosphate and not likely to form from the given reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide compound, like HCN, but HCN is a weak acid and not extremely hazardous in small quantities.

Wait, another thought: if E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), which is a strong oxidizer. Ozone has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. So its point group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would E be formed? If C is something like O2 and D is O3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like ClO2, which is a toxic gas. ClO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. So if E is ClO2, its symmetry group would be C2v.

But how would that form from C and D?

Wait, perhaps C is ClO and D is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to find a better approach. Let's see:

From reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So the hydrolysis of C produces a strong acid and a weak acid. So C must contain two different anions that form these acids when hydrolyzed.

For example, if C is a salt of both HCl and HCN, perhaps. But how?

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt like Ca(Cl)(CN). When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Cl- and CN- ions. Cl- would form HCl (strong acid), and CN- would form HCN (weak acid), which is a possibility. But would such a salt be stable?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex like NH4Cl and another component, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal that when hydrolyzed produces two acids. For example, perhaps C is a metal that forms different oxides or hydroxides, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate and a chloride. For example, if C is Na2CO3·2NaCl. Upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (from Na2CO3) and HCl (from NaCl). But NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite and a carbonate. But then the hydrolysis would produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3, which is a weak acid) and carbonic acid (H2CO3, also a weak acid), but not a strong acid.

Hmm. Maybe F is H2SO4 and G is something else. But how would that form from C?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate that when hydrolyzed produces H2SO4 and another acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chlorate (like KClO3) which upon hydrolysis produces HClO3 (a strong acid) and another compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of Cl- and another anion, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaCl and another salt, but that doesn't fit the solid C.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride, but that's perhaps more complex.

At this point, I think I might be missing a key insight, so perhaps I should try to think about the possible symmetry groups and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options again:

A) C2: 2-fold rotation axis.

B) D4h: higher symmetry, includes four-fold rotations and reflections.

C) D∞h: infinite symmetry, like a cylinder.

D) C2v: 2-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes.

If E is a molecule with a D∞h symmetry, like CO2 or phosgene, then the answer would be option C.

But how does that fit into the reaction?

Wait, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas, and C reacts with D (O2) to form it.

Wait, let me think about the reaction: C + 2 D → E.

If D is O2 and E is O=CCl2, then C must be something that reacts with O2 to form phosgene. For example, perhaps C is CH2Cl2 (methylene chloride) reacting with O2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that upon oxidation forms phosgene. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should think about the symmetry groups.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is option C, then perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO2 or phosgene.

In that case, the answer would be C) D∞h.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think that's the most plausible.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The stoichiometry (8 equivalents of B) suggests a high reactivity ratio. B is likely a diatomic gas like H₂ or Cl₂.  
   - The bright red color of C could indicate a compound like CuCl₂ or a related colored compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic compounds like phosgene (O=CCl₂) or sarin gas.  
   - Phosgene is a toxic gas with a planar structure and D∞h symmetry, making it a plausible candidate for E.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.  
   - F is a strong acid (e.g., HCl), and G is a weak acid (e.g., HCN).  
   - This suggests C contains anions that hydrolyze to form these acids, such as Cl⁻ and CN⁻.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.  
   - If H is H₂O, then D and B could be O₂ and H₂, respectively, as they combine to form water.

### Molecular Symmetry of E
- If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), its structure is planar with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two chlorine atoms.  
- Phosgene has a D∞h symmetry group due to its infinite rotational axis (C∞), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and other associated symmetry elements.  
- This matches the description of E as a highly hazardous compound with significant molecular symmetry.

### Conclusion
Based on the reactions and the molecular symmetry analysis, the most plausible candidate for E is phosgene, which has a D∞h symmetry group.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and break it down step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, so I'll need to think this through.

First, let me outline the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid (like HCl, H2SO4), and G is a weak acid (like acetic acid, HCN).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. I need to figure out what these substances could be. Let's start by considering possible reactions.

The first reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and used in large amounts, maybe B is something like O2, Cl2, or another diatomic gas. The product C is bright red, which is a clue. I remember that some metal sulfides or oxides are red, but more importantly, certain metal oxides when combined with other elements can form colored compounds.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is chlorine gas (Cl2). If A is a metal, say copper, then reacting with Cl2 might form CuCl2, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, if A is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a formation of a complex or something else.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to give A plus two acids F and G. So, C is likely a compound that, when hydrolyzed, breaks down into A and two acids. For example, maybe a metal chloride hydrolyzes into a metal hydroxide (or oxide) and HCl, but the presence of two different acids suggests that perhaps C has two different anions.

Wait, wait. Let's think of a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. One of them is strong, the other weak. For example, suppose C is a salt that contains two different anions. When it reacts with water, each anion could form its respective acid. So, maybe C is a nitride or some other compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with water to produce carbon (or another element) and some acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Wait, but sulfide reactions tend to produce H2S, which is a gas, but we have two acids here.

Wait, another angle: looking at reaction 2, C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. D and B forming H, which is a solvent—maybe H is something like H2O, but B is a gas, so perhaps B is H2 and D is O2? Then H would be H2O. Wait, but D and B would be H2 and O2, which in a 1:1 ratio form H2O, which is a solvent. That's a possibility.

Wait, but D reacting with B to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B would be O2 and H2, which react to form H2O. But that's a possible scenario.

So if B is H2, then reaction 1 is A + 8 H2 → C. What would A be then? Maybe A is something that reacts with hydrogen in a high ratio. Perhaps a transition metal. For example, iron reacting with H2 in some context. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Then, reaction 1 would be A + 8 Cl2 → C. What if A is copper metal? 2 Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2 (but that's 1:1 ratio, not 8). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state with Cl. For example, maybe it's a reaction like aluminum reacting with Cl2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, let's think about the products. C, when reacted with water, gives A plus two acids. So if C is a chloride, perhaps it's a mixture of different chlorides. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex ion, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something like: A is carbon. B is oxygen. 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with carbon to form CO? But that's only 1 O2 per C, so 8 O2 would mean 8 * 2 = 16 O atoms. But carbon and O2 reacting to form CO would be 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. Again, not matching 8 equivalents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous, so maybe it's something like phosgene (but I'm not certain), or perhaps something like dioxin, but more likely, it's a common hazardous compound.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with D to form E, and D is a gas. So perhaps D is something like Cl2 or another halogen. C could be a metal carbide, as they can react with halogens. Hmm.

Wait, going back to the fourth reaction: D + B → H, which is a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like H2O, ethanol, or something else. But if H is a product of D and B, and B is a gas, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, forming H2O as solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else.

Wait, let's consider D and B producing H as a solvent. Suppose B is O2 and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else. But that might not fit as well.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the product E. It's produced when C reacts with D. E is extremely hazardous. So E might be a toxic gas, or a highly reactive compound.

Wait, let's think of possible reactions where C and D form E. Perhaps D is Cl2, and C is a metal oxide, leading to some acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to outline each reaction with possible compounds. Let me make a table:

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (solid to gas reaction, product is solid C)

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G weak acid)

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

Let me try to find possible compounds.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1.

Possible H: H2O, ethanol, NH3, etc. If H is H2O, then D and B could be O2 and H2.

Wait, for example:

If B is H2 (gas), D is O2 (gas). Then D + B → H2O (solvent, H). But H2O is a solvent, so that's possible.

So then:

Reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O (H is H2O)

If that's the case, D is O2, B is H2.

Then Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C.

What's A reacting with H2 in 8 equivalents? Maybe A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. For example, consider a metal that forms a hydride or some compound with H2.

Wait, another way: perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is a metal oxide, and H2 is a reducing agent.

Wait, but 8 H2 would mean 8 moles of H2 per mole of A. That's a lot. Maybe A is a metal in a high oxidation state, like Fe^3+ or something else.

Wait, when a metal reacts with H2, it might form a metal hydride. For example, sodium reacts with H2 to form NaH. But sodium hydride is a strong base. But in this case, perhaps with 8 H2 per A, maybe a more complex reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and the reaction is something like A + H2 → AH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when A is a metal and reacts with H2 in high amounts, it could form a complex. Alternatively, maybe it's not a metal but a non-metal, like sulfur. Sulfur reacts with H2 in the presence of a catalyst to form H2S, but that's a gas, and C is a solid, so that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps B isn't H2. Let me think of another possibility.

What if B is Cl2? Then in reaction 1: A + 8 Cl2 → C.

What could A be? If A is a metal, perhaps it's reacting with Cl2 to form a chloride. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions, but the stoichiometry may not match. Let's see: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So, 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. But here, it's 8 Cl2 per 1 A. So maybe A is a metal that forms a higher chloride, like PbCl4?

Wait, another possibility: A is a metal that forms a complex when reacted with Cl2. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a chloro compound with multiple Cl atoms.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

Since F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt of two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite or something else that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids.

Wait, another thought: if C is a mixed salt, like a metal carbonate reacting with water? No, because carbonate would produce CO2 and a hydroxide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with water to produce HCl and SiO2? Wait, SiC + H2O → SiO2 + CH4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 and Ca(OH)2. But that's not two acids.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)S (or Fe(OH)2/Fe(OH)3) and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So if F is a strong acid, perhaps another component is involved.

Wait, but how would C produce two acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe C is a salt containing two different anions that each form an acid. For example, a salt like NH4Cl and another acid. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps C is a double salt, like Ca(ClO)Cl. Upon hydrolysis, it could produce HCl and HClO. HCl is a strong acid, and HClO is a weak acid (but not as weak as something like acetic acid, though). Alternatively, maybe the salt is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce two different acids. But most metal oxides either produce a single acid (like Na2O → 2 NaOH) or don't react (like SiO2, which is inert). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, AlN reacts with water to produce NH3 and Al(OH)3. But again, that gives a base and a hydroxide, not acids.

Another possibility: C is a mixed carbonate, like calcium carbonate, but that produces CO2 and a hydroxide upon reaction with water. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonyl. For example, perhaps nickel carbonyl, but I don't see how that would give two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxynitride or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps C is a metal chloride that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and another acid. For example, if C is a mixture of chlorides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think of the products when C reacts with D. If D is Cl2, and C is a metal, then E could be a higher chloride. For example, if C is FeCl2, reacting with Cl2 might form FeCl3. But E is extremely hazardous, which suggests maybe it's a more dangerous compound.

Wait, another idea: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like phosgene (but that's COCl2), or maybe something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small quantities. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe E is a product of a reaction between C and D that's explosive or highly toxic. For example, if C is a metal sulfide and D is Cl2, perhaps they react to form SO2 and metal chloride, but SO2 is toxic, but I'm not sure if that's E.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide reacting with D (Cl2) to form an acid (like HCl), but that's probably not E.

Wait, perhaps E is a dioxin or something, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a result of a substitution reaction. Let's think about D and C.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride and D is a stronger acid, which would displace something. Or maybe C is a halide that reacts with another halogen.

Hmm, perhaps C is a chloride, and D is another halogen like F2, which could cause some displacement. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is Cl2, leading to SO2 and metal chloride. But let's see.

Wait, another angle: the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

I'm a bit rusty on my point groups. Let me recall:

- C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis. Symmetrical along that axis.

- D4h: dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and reflections. High symmetry.

- D∞h: infinite dihedral, like a cylinder with many mirror planes and rotational symmetry.

- C2v: has a 2-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So which of these would E have?

If E is something like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If E is something like phosgene (O=CCl2), what's its symmetry? Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two Cl atoms. Its point group is D∞h because it has a C∞ axis perpendicular to the Cl atoms, and mirror planes.

But I'm not certain if that's the case, but let's see.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is bent (like O=C=O), but SO2 has a D∞h symmetry as well. Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2 axis, so its point group is D2h or C2v? Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2 axis (the axis through the sulfur and the midpoint between the two oxygens), and two mirror planes (each containing the axis and one of the O atoms). So its point group is D2h or perhaps C2v. Wait, I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible E. If E is something like phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a structure where the central carbon is bonded to an O (double bond) and two Cl atoms. The molecule has a C2v symmetry because it has a mirror plane through the C=O bond and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to that.

Wait, no, phosgene is more accurately described as having D∞h symmetry because it's a planar molecule with a C∞ axis. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up different molecules.

Wait, another way: if E is something like dioxane, which has a D4h symmetry. But dioxane is a solvent, not a product of a reaction that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but let's think about what E could be. If E is a linear molecule, then it would have D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a C2 symmetry, like H2O, which has a C2 symmetry when looking down the axis (but actually, H2O has a C2v symmetry because of the two mirror planes and a C2 axis).

Wait, perhaps E is HCl, but that's a simple molecule with C∞v symmetry. But HCl is a gas, and E is extremely hazardous, which might fit.

Alternatively, if E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxetane), which is a highly toxic compound. But I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should go back to the reactions.

Let me try to outline all reactions with possible substances.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio). Let's assume H is water (H2O). Then D and B must combine to form H2O. So if B is H2 and D is O2, then H is H2O. So B is H2, D is O2.

So in reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O.

Now, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (solid).

So A is a solid that reacts with H2 in 8 equivalents. Let me think of a metal that reacts with H2 in such a high ratio. For example, maybe it's a metal that forms a complex hydride. Or perhaps it's a non-metal like sulfur reacting in a high ratio.

Wait, another possibility: A is carbon, and the reaction is a combustion reaction, but that would require O2, which is not the case here. Or maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe3O4, and H2 is the reducing agent. The reaction would be Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and H2O. But that doesn't produce a solid C. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. Let's say A is CrO3 (a solid). Reacting with H2: CrO3 + H2 → Cr + H2O. But how many equivalents? Let me see.

CrO3 has the formula CrO3. The reaction would need to balance:

CrO3 + H2 → Cr + H2O.

Let's balance it. CrO3 → Cr (reduction: Cr from +6 to 0 oxidation state). H2 is oxidized to H2O (oxidation from 0 to +1).

So each H2 provides 2 H's. Let's see:

CrO3 + 3 H2 → Cr + 3 H2O.

That's 3 equivalents of H2. But in our problem, it's 8 equivalents, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe A is a different compound. Let me think. What if A is a metal that forms a complex with H2? For example, sodium in H2 forms NaH, but the stoichiometry would be 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a high valency, like OsO4. OsO4 + H2 → Os + H2O.

Wait, OsO4 has the formula OsO4. Let's write the reaction:

OsO4 + H2 → Os + 2 H2O.

Balancing:

OsO4 → Os^0, so each Os goes from +8 to 0. So 4 H2O are produced, but let's balance:

OsO4 + 2 H2 → Os + 4 H2O.

So, 2 H2 per OsO4. That's 2 equivalents. But our reaction uses 8 equivalents, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let me think of C. C is a solid that reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

Suppose C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, maybe it's a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is KCN and HCl, but that's not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixed carbonate, but I’m not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal chloride. For instance, if C is a mixture of chlorides, but that doesn't immediately suggest two acids.

Wait, if C is a metal carbonate, perhaps it would produce CO2 and a hydroxide, but that's not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixture of chlorides and another anion.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. H2S is a weak acid. So if F is a strong acid, perhaps the other product is HCl. But where would Cl come from? Unless C has Cl in it.

Wait, perhaps C is FeS and also contains Cl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro-sulfide, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like SiC. SiC reacts with water to produce CH4 and H2SiO3 (which is a weak acid, but I'm not sure if it's considered a strong acid). Alternatively, perhaps another carbide.

Wait, another angle: if C reacts with water to produce a strong acid F and a weak acid G, perhaps F is HCl and G is HCN. To get HCl and HCN, C must contain Cl and CN groups. But then, what would C be?

Wait, perhaps C is CuCNCl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide and a chloride salt. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide and a metal chloride, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about E again. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound. For example, phosgene (O=CCl2) is a toxic gas. What's its molecular symmetry?

Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar, with a C=O double bond. The point group is D∞h because it has an infinite axis of rotation (C∞), a mirror plane (σh), and other symmetry elements.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, how does that fit into the reactions? Let me try to piece it together.

Suppose C is something that when reacted with D (which is O2) produces phosgene. Let's see: C + 2 O2 → phosgene (O=CCl2) + ... ?

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that upon reaction with O2 forms phosgene. Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated hydrocarbon.

Wait, another approach: if D is O2 and C is CCl4, then C + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 Cl2. But that's not phosgene.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CH2Cl2, which when reacted with O2 could form phosgene, but I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to think of another possibility for E.

Another extremely hazardous compound is sarin gas, but that's an organophosphate and not likely to form from the given reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide compound, like HCN, but HCN is a weak acid and not extremely hazardous in small quantities.

Wait, another thought: if E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), which is a strong oxidizer. Ozone has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. So its point group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would E be formed? If C is something like O2 and D is O3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like ClO2, which is a toxic gas. ClO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. So if E is ClO2, its symmetry group would be C2v.

But how would that form from C and D?

Wait, perhaps C is ClO and D is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to find a better approach. Let's see:

From reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So the hydrolysis of C produces a strong acid and a weak acid. So C must contain two different anions that form these acids when hydrolyzed.

For example, if C is a salt of both HCl and HCN, perhaps. But how?

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt like Ca(Cl)(CN). When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Cl- and CN- ions. Cl- would form HCl (strong acid), and CN- would form HCN (weak acid), which is a possibility. But would such a salt be stable?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex like NH4Cl and another component, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal that when hydrolyzed produces two acids. For example, perhaps C is a metal that forms different oxides or hydroxides, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate and a chloride. For example, if C is Na2CO3·2NaCl. Upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (from Na2CO3) and HCl (from NaCl). But NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite and a carbonate. But then the hydrolysis would produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3, which is a weak acid) and carbonic acid (H2CO3, also a weak acid), but not a strong acid.

Hmm. Maybe F is H2SO4 and G is something else. But how would that form from C?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate that when hydrolyzed produces H2SO4 and another acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chlorate (like KClO3) which upon hydrolysis produces HClO3 (a strong acid) and another compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of Cl- and another anion, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaCl and another salt, but that doesn't fit the solid C.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride, but that's perhaps more complex.

At this point, I think I might be missing a key insight, so perhaps I should try to think about the possible symmetry groups and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options again:

A) C2: 2-fold rotation axis.

B) D4h: higher symmetry, includes four-fold rotations and reflections.

C) D∞h: infinite symmetry, like a cylinder.

D) C2v: 2-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes.

If E is a molecule with a D∞h symmetry, like CO2 or phosgene, then the answer would be option C.

But how does that fit into the reaction?

Wait, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas, and C reacts with D (O2) to form it.

Wait, let me think about the reaction: C + 2 D → E.

If D is O2 and E is O=CCl2, then C must be something that reacts with O2 to form phosgene. For example, perhaps C is CH2Cl2 (methylene chloride) reacting with O2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that upon oxidation forms phosgene. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should think about the symmetry groups.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is option C, then perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO2 or phosgene.

In that case, the answer would be C) D∞h.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think that's the most plausible.


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The stoichiometry (8 equivalents of B) suggests a high reactivity ratio. B is likely a diatomic gas like H₂ or Cl₂.  
   - The bright red color of C could indicate a compound like CuCl₂ or a related colored compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic compounds like phosgene (O=CCl₂) or sarin gas.  
   - Phosgene is a toxic gas with a planar structure and D∞h symmetry, making it a plausible candidate for E.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.  
   - F is a strong acid (e.g., HCl), and G is a weak acid (e.g., HCN).  
   - This suggests C contains anions that hydrolyze to form these acids, such as Cl⁻ and CN⁻.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.  
   - If H is H₂O, then D and B could be O₂ and H₂, respectively, as they combine to form water.

### Molecular Symmetry of E
- If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), its structure is planar with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two chlorine atoms.  
- Phosgene has a D∞h symmetry group due to its infinite rotational axis (C∞), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and other associated symmetry elements.  
- This matches the description of E as a highly hazardous compound with significant molecular symmetry.

### Conclusion
Based on the reactions and the molecular symmetry analysis, the most plausible candidate for E is phosgene, which has a D∞h symmetry group.

**Answer: C**
