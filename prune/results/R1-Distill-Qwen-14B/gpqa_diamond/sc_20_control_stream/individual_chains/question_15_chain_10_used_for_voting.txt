Alright, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what I know about transiting exoplanets and the probability of such events.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to us. But wait, how do other factors like the star's size, the planet's orbit, and the mass come into play here?

The question says both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method gives us the minimum mass of a planet because it relies on the Doppler shift. But in this case, both planets have the same mass, so that's a given.

The key factors for transit probability, as I recall, are the size of the star and the size of the planet, but wait, since they're Earth-like, maybe their sizes are similar enough. But the question mentions the star's mass and radius. Oh, and the orbital periods are different, so perhaps the semi-major axes vary as well.

Wait, the transit probability formula I think is something like (R_planet + R_star)² divided by (a_planet²), but no, that's the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Or was it R_star over a_planet, multiplied by some other factors? Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, squared.

Wait, no, the probability of a transit is actually given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but considering only the star's radius because the planet's radius is much smaller. So, it's approximately R_star / a_planet, but that would be a linear term. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up.

Wait, wait. The formula for the transit probability is (R_*/ a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)), where R_* is the star's radius, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and R_p is the planet's radius. But since both planets are Earth-like, R_p is similar, so maybe we can ignore R_p compared to R_*. So the probability is roughly (R_* / a) * something, but wait, that can't be right because when a is larger, the probability should be smaller, which the formula would capture. So, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_* / a).

But wait, I think I'm missing something because I remember that the probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit. The probability that the orbit is aligned to cause a transit is more accurately given by (R_* / a) * (1 / sin i), but if the RV method has already detected the planet, then the inclination isn't perfectly edge-on. Wait, no, the RV method can detect planets even with some inclination, but the actual transit depends on the inclination being near 90 degrees.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits from our point of view) is given by (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So, the probability is (R_* / (a * (1 + m_star / M_planet))), but wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, I think I'm confusing some terms here. Let's think again. The transit probability is the fraction of time when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for us to see the transit. The formula I remember is:

P ≈ (R_* / a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*))

But for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_*, so we can approximate it as P ≈ R_* / a.

Wait, but a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. So a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) / (4π²)) * P². Since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, a^3 ≈ (G M_*) (P/(2π))².

So, a = [ (G M_* ) (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3)

Hmm. So, for each planet, we can compute a in terms of their star's mass and period.

Wait, but the question says that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 = P2 / 3.

And the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2.

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = [ (G M1 ) (P1/(2π))² ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G M2 ) (P2/(2π))² ]^(1/3 )

But since P1 = P2 /3, let's substitute that.

a1 = [ (G (2 M2) ) ( (P2/(3*2π))² ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 G M2 ) ( P2²/(9 (2π)^2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Factor out the constants.

= [ (2 * G M2 * P2² ) / (9 (2π)^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 is:

a2 = [ (G M2 ) ( (P2/(2π))² ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So now, let's compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2 * G M2 * P2² ) / (9 (2π)^2) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to:

[ (2 / 9 (4 π²) ) / (1/ (4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, let me compute the ratio inside the cube root:

Numerator: 2/(9*(4 π²)) 
Denominator: 1/(4 π²) 

Wait, no, the entire term is [ (2 * ... ) / (9 (2π)^2) ) ] / [ ( ... ) / (4 π²) ) ]

Wait, more accurately, the ratio is:

(2 / (9*(2π)^2)) ) / (1/(4 π²)) )

= (2 / (9 *4 π² )) ) * (4 π² / 1 )

= 2/(36 π²) *4 π² 

= (2 *4 π²) / (36 π²) )

= 8 π² / (36 π²) ) 

= 8/(36) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of ~0.222.

What's the cube root of 0.222? Let's approximate:

0.222 is about 0.216, which is (0.6)^3. So cube root is ~0.6. But 0.222 is a bit higher.

So, 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.63^3 = approx 0.25 (since 0.63^3 is about 0.63 * 0.63=0.3969; 0.3969 *0.63≈0.25 (since 0.4 *0.63=0.252), so 0.63^3 ≈0.25. So 0.222 is between 0.62 and 0.63.

Let me compute 0.62^3: 0.62 *0.62=0.3844; 0.3844 *0.62 ≈0.238. Hmm, 0.238 is higher than 0.222. So 0.62^3≈0.238, which is higher than 0.222.

Wait, 0.63^3 is approx 0.25, as before.

So 0.62 gives 0.238, which is higher than 0.222, so we're looking for a number a little less than 0.62.

Let me try 0.61.

0.61^3 = 0.61 * 0.61 = 0.3721. 0.3721 * 0.61 ≈ 0.2269.

That's close to 0.222. So maybe around 0.605.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's better to compute the exact ratio.

But perhaps a better approach is to express a1 and a2 in terms of each other using the parameters.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach the transit probability.

The transit probability is higher when (R_* / a) is larger, because P ≈ R_* / a.

So, for each planet, P1 = R1 / a1, P2 = R2 / a2.

But R1 = R2, so the transit probability is proportional to (1/a1) and (1/a2).

Thus, the probability ratio is (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1.

So if a1 is smaller, then a2/a1 is greater than 1, so planet 2 has a higher probability.

Wait, no: because if a is smaller, R_star is same, so R/a is larger, so higher probability.

So higher transit probability when a is smaller, because R is same.

So, which planet has a smaller a? Let's see.

Wait, a is the semi-major axis. Planet_1 has a shorter period, but is orbiting a more massive star.

So, for the same period, a would be smaller if the mass is larger. Because a^3 is proportional to M * P².

But since Planet_1 has shorter P and a larger M, which effect is stronger?

Let me compute a1 and a2.

Let me write a in terms of M and P.

a = [ (G M P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So, a1 = [ (G (2 M2) (P1)^2 )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

But P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 = [ (2 G M2 (P2²/9) )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 G M2 P2² )/(9 *4 π² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (G M2 P2² )/(4 π² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2/(9*4)) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (1/4) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, let's compute the numerator inside the cube root for a1: (2 G M2 P2^2 )/(36 π² )

Denominator for a2: (1 G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² )

So, a1 is [ 2/(36) ) * (1/4) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps better to factor the constants.

Wait, a1 = [ (2 G M2 P2^2 ) / (36 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, a1 = [ (2/36) * (1/4) )^(... no, wait, the denominator in a1 is 36 π², because 9*4=36.

Wait, let me compute the ratio of a1 to a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2/(36)) / (1/4) ]^(1/3 )

Because a1's numerator is 2, a2's is 1. a1's denominator is 36, a2's is 4.

So the ratio is (2/36) / (1/4) = (2/36) * (4/1) ) = (8)/(36) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.63.

So a1 is about 0.63 times a2.

Which means a1 is smaller than a2.

So transit probability is proportional to R_star/a_planet. Since R1=R2, the probabilities are proportional to 1/a1 and 1/a2.

So P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/(0.63) ≈ 1.587.

So approximately 1.59 times higher probability for Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, the options have some options saying Planet_2 is preferred, others Planet_1.

Wait, so if Planet_1's transit probability is higher (about 1.6 times), then the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Option D: 2.7 times.

Wait, but my calculation gives about 1.59, which is roughly 1.6 times.

So the closest option is option C: 1.65 times.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

The a1/a2 ratio: (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Therefore, 1/a1 = 1/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 times (1/a2).

So transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Thus, Planet_1 is preferred, with about 1.65 times higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct choice.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

Given:
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period),
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star),

we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.63
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.63a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. The ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.63} \approx 1.59
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. While Planet_2 has some transit probability, it is not 1.5 times higher than Planet_1's.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher transit probability.
- **D)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7 times.

**Answer: C**

So, a = [ (G M_* ) (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3)

Hmm. So, for each planet, we can compute a in terms of their star's mass and period.

Wait, but the question says that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 = P2 / 3.

And the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2.

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = [ (G M1 ) (P1/(2π))² ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G M2 ) (P2/(2π))² ]^(1/3 )

But since P1 = P2 /3, let's substitute that.

a1 = [ (G (2 M2) ) ( (P2/(3*2π))² ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 G M2 ) ( P2²/(9 (2π)^2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Factor out the constants.

= [ (2 * G M2 * P2² ) / (9 (2π)^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 is:

a2 = [ (G M2 ) ( (P2/(2π))² ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So now, let's compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2 * G M2 * P2² ) / (9 (2π)^2) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to:

[ (2 / 9 (4 π²) ) / (1/ (4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, let me compute the ratio inside the cube root:

Numerator: 2/(9*(4 π²)) 
Denominator: 1/(4 π²) 

Wait, no, the entire term is [ (2 * ... ) / (9 (2π)^2) ) ] / [ ( ... ) / (4 π²) ) ]

Wait, more accurately, the ratio is:

(2 / (9*(2π)^2)) ) / (1/(4 π²)) )

= (2 / (9 *4 π² )) ) * (4 π² / 1 )

= 2/(36 π²) *4 π² 

= (2 *4 π²) / (36 π²) )

= 8 π² / (36 π²) ) 

= 8/(36) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of ~0.222.

What's the cube root of 0.222? Let's approximate:

0.222 is about 0.216, which is (0.6)^3. So cube root is ~0.6. But 0.222 is a bit higher.

So, 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.63^3 = approx 0.25 (since 0.63^3 is about 0.63 * 0.63=0.3969; 0.3969 *0.63≈0.25 (since 0.4 *0.63=0.252), so 0.63^3 ≈0.25. So 0.222 is between 0.62 and 0.63.

Let me compute 0.62^3: 0.62 *0.62=0.3844; 0.3844 *0.62 ≈0.238. Hmm, 0.238 is higher than 0.222. So 0.62^3≈0.238, which is higher than 0.222.

Wait, 0.63^3 is approx 0.25, as before.

So 0.62 gives 0.238, which is higher than 0.222, so we're looking for a number a little less than 0.62.

Let me try 0.61.

0.61^3 = 0.61 * 0.61 = 0.3721. 0.3721 * 0.61 ≈ 0.2269.

That's close to 0.222. So maybe around 0.605.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's better to compute the exact ratio.

But perhaps a better approach is to express a1 and a2 in terms of each other using the parameters.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach the transit probability.

The transit probability is higher when (R_* / a) is larger, because P ≈ R_* / a.

So, for each planet, P1 = R1 / a1, P2 = R2 / a2.

But R1 = R2, so the transit probability is proportional to (1/a1) and (1/a2).

Thus, the probability ratio is (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1.

So if a1 is smaller, then a2/a1 is greater than 1, so planet 2 has a higher probability.

Wait, no: because if a is smaller, R_star is same, so R/a is larger, so higher probability.

So higher transit probability when a is smaller, because R is same.

So, which planet has a smaller a? Let's see.

Wait, a is the semi-major axis. Planet_1 has a shorter period, but is orbiting a more massive star.

So, for the same period, a would be smaller if the mass is larger. Because a^3 is proportional to M * P².

But since Planet_1 has shorter P and a larger M, which effect is stronger?

Let me compute a1 and a2.

Let me write a in terms of M and P.

a = [ (G M P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So, a1 = [ (G (2 M2) (P1)^2 )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

But P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 = [ (2 G M2 (P2²/9) )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 G M2 P2² )/(9 *4 π² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (G M2 P2² )/(4 π² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2/(9*4)) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (1/4) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, let's compute the numerator inside the cube root for a1: (2 G M2 P2^2 )/(36 π² )

Denominator for a2: (1 G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² )

So, a1 is [ 2/(36) ) * (1/4) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps better to factor the constants.

Wait, a1 = [ (2 G M2 P2^2 ) / (36 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, a1 = [ (2/36) * (1/4) )^(... no, wait, the denominator in a1 is 36 π², because 9*4=36.

Wait, let me compute the ratio of a1 to a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2/(36)) / (1/4) ]^(1/3 )

Because a1's numerator is 2, a2's is 1. a1's denominator is 36, a2's is 4.

So the ratio is (2/36) / (1/4) = (2/36) * (4/1) ) = (8)/(36) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.63.

So a1 is about 0.63 times a2.

Which means a1 is smaller than a2.

So transit probability is proportional to R_star/a_planet. Since R1=R2, the probabilities are proportional to 1/a1 and 1/a2.

So P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/(0.63) ≈ 1.587.

So approximately 1.59 times higher probability for Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, the options have some options saying Planet_2 is preferred, others Planet_1.

Wait, so if Planet_1's transit probability is higher (about 1.6 times), then the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Option D: 2.7 times.

Wait, but my calculation gives about 1.59, which is roughly 1.6 times.

So the closest option is option C: 1.65 times.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

The a1/a2 ratio: (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Therefore, 1/a1 = 1/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 times (1/a2).

So transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Thus, Planet_1 is preferred, with about 1.65 times higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct choice.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

Given:
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period),
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star),

we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.63
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.63a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. The ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.63} \approx 1.59
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. While Planet_2 has some transit probability, it is not 1.5 times higher than Planet_1's.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher transit probability.
- **D)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7 times.

**Answer: C**
