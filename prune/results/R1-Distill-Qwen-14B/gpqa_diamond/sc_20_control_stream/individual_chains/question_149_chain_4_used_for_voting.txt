Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it again and think through.

The scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptide, and I'm looking at its NMR and LC-MS data. The 1H NMR spectrum looks right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks of the same mass, same intensity.

Hmm, so in NMR, when two peaks appear for the same proton, but they integrate to the correct amount, and it's not coupling, what could that mean? One possibility is that the compound is a mixture of something. Wait, if it's a diastereomer, that would cause different NMR signals for some protons. Enantiomers, though, would show the same NMR signals because they're mirror images. But wait, in some cases, maybe the environment isn't perfectly symmetric, so maybe you can see differences. But the question says the shifts are similar, not completely identical. So maybe it's diastereomers.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So perhaps there's some kind of splitting not due to coupling. Or maybe it's due to exchange or something else. Alternatively, if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same signals, but since the problem says two peaks, that might not be it. Unless... maybe it's a diastereomeric mixture, leading to different environments for the protons.

Wait, but the question states that both peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So same proton in different environments. So perhaps the molecule is in a mixture that causes this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, so it's not a precursor. Because a precursor would have a higher mass, perhaps.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. As I thought earlier, enantiomers would have same NMR signals, so you wouldn't see two separate peaks. Unless maybe the NMR is somehow splitting due to something else, but I don't think that's common. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling usually refers to a proton being split by two different types of coupling, like J coupling and another. But in the question, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe this isn't the case. Or maybe it's a different kind of coupling, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different signals. So two peaks for the same alpha-proton would make sense if the molecule exists as diastereomers. For example, if the alpha-proton is in different environments in each diastereomer, you get two different signals. And the integral adds up because each diastereomer contributes one proton. But wait, if there are two diastereomers in equal amounts, the integral of each peak would be 0.5H, adding up to 1H. So that fits the NMR data.

But wait, what about the LC-MS data? The LC shows two peaks of same mass. Diastereomers have the same molecular weight, so their mass spectra would look the same. So two peaks would indicate two different substances with same mass. That would suggest it's not diastereomers, because diastereomers have same molecular weight, so each would be a separate peak. But how would that lead to two peaks in LC-MS?

Wait, no. LC-MS usually separates based on retention time. If a compound is a racemic mixture, the LC would show one peak because the enantiomers may elute at the same time (if the column isn't chiral). Similarly, if it's a diastereomer mixture, the LC might separate them into two peaks. So if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, the LC-MS would show two peaks with the same mass because diastereomers have the same molecular weight but different structures. Oh wait, no, diastereomers have different physical properties, so they might elute at different times on LC, but same mass. So the LC would show two peaks of same mass.

So putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which suggests different environments (so diastereomers). The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, which would fit diastereomers. So option D seems possible.

Option C: Double coupling. Hmm, but the coupling pattern rules that out. So probably not.

So the likely answer is option D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but wait another point. The NMR shows same integral. So if it's a 50:50 mixture of diastereomers, each with one alpha-proton, each would contribute 0.5H, so total integral is 1H. That fits.

Yes, I think D is the correct answer.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound based on its NMR and LC-MS data. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (totaling 1H). This rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. The LC-MS data shows two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass as the expected molecule.

**Option A**: Contamination with a precursor is unlikely because a precursor would have a higher mass, whereas the LC-MS data shows peaks consistent with the expected molecular mass.

**Option B**: A mixture of enantiomers would not explain the two NMR peaks, as enantiomers produce identical NMR signals due to their mirror-image symmetry. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the observations.

**Option C**: 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction could theoretically split a proton into two peaks, but the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Therefore, this explanation is not applicable.

**Option D**: A mixture of diastereoisomers is the most plausible explanation. Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical environments, leading to distinct NMR signals for the same proton. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum could arise from the alpha-proton being in different environments in each diastereomer. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of the same mass, is consistent with diastereomers, as they share the same molecular weight but have different physical properties, causing them to elute at different times in LC.

Thus, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
