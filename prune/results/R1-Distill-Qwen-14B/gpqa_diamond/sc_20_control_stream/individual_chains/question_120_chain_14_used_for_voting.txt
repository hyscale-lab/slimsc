Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean uniformly in space or just on the celestial sphere? Oh right, if they're uniformly distributed in the sky, it probably means their spatial distribution is uniform. So they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular clustering.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax range.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax: distance = 1 / plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a spherical shell at a certain distance would depend on the volume of that shell. But wait, how does parallax relate to the volume?

Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. So for stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr, the number of stars would be proportional to 4πr² dr times the number density (which is constant, say n).

But since parallax plx is 1/r, we can express r as 1/plx. So substituting r = 1/plx into the volume, the number of stars in a shell should be proportional to 4π(1/plx)^2 * (dr). But wait, I'm looking for the number per unit range of plx, not per unit distance.

Hmm, so I need to relate dr (change in distance) to a change in parallax dplx. Because plx is 1/r, so dplx = -1/r² dr. Wait, that negative sign just indicates the direction, but since we're dealing with absolute values, I can ignore the sign. So dr = - r² dplx. Since r is 1/plx, plx is p, so r = 1/p. So dr = -(1/p)^2 dplx = dplx/(p^2).

Wait, let me get that correctly. If p = 1/r, then dp = - (1/r²) dr. So rearranged, dr = - r² dp. The negative sign shows that as p increases (since we're moving to larger p), r is decreasing. But for the magnitude, we can write dr = (1/p²) dp.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr is N = n * 4π r² dr. Substituting dr as (1/p²) dp, N becomes n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, let me double-check that substitution. r = 1/p, so r squared is 1/p². Then dr is (1/p²) dp. So N = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me go step by step. The number of stars in a shell is N = 4π r² dr * n. Since r = 1/p, then r squared is 1/p². So N = 4π (1/p²) dr *n.

But dr = (1/p^2) dp, because dr = (1/p^2) dp as I found earlier. So substituting, N = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p^2) dp *n = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (d p) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So it's the number of stars per unit plx interval. So for a small change in plx, dp, the number of stars would be proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the options don't have 1/plx^4. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be the case if the number per unit plx is ~1/p^4. But wait, another approach: maybe I should consider the number per unit volume in plx space.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think differently.

Parallax p = 1/d. So as d increases, p decreases.

The number of stars per unit volume in space is n, which is constant. The volume element in 3D space is dV = 4π d^2 dd, where d is the distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n *4π d^2 dd.

But we want this in terms of p. Since p=1/d, d = 1/p. So d^2 = 1/p^2. dd = change in d = (1/p^2) dp, where dp is the change in p.

Substituting into N: N = n * 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit range of p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. That would mean the number per unit parallax interval decreases as p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for each small interval dp, the number is ~1/p^4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've seen other problems where the number of stars per unit volume in terms of distance is 1/d^3, but that's when considering the volume increasing with distance.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars between plx p and p+dp. So as p increases, the distance decreases. So the number of stars in a shell at p is proportional to the surface area (4π (1/p)^2 ) times the thickness in distance dr. But dr is (1/p²) dp.

So N = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So for each unit dp, the number is 4π n (1/p^4). So the number per unit plx (dp) is 1/p^4. So the answer is A.

Wait, but another way to think: the number of stars per unit volume in space is n. So the number of stars per unit volume per unit distance is n. The volume per unit distance at distance d is a spherical shell with volume 4πd² dd. So number of stars per unit distance is 4πd² n.

But in terms of p, since d = 1/p, that becomes 4π (1/p^2) n = 4πn/p^2. But that's the number per unit distance. But we're interested in the number per unit parallax.

Wait, so perhaps the approach should be to find the number per unit parallax interval (dp). So integrating over the volume, for a given p, the number in a shell with thickness dp (in p terms) would be N = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp *n = 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So per unit dp, it's 1/p^4.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the number of stars at a particular parallax p. The number of stars per unit volume is n. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV.

The volume element in terms of p is a thin shell in p. But how to express dV in terms of p.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation between distance and parallax. Since p = 1/d, the differential dp = - (1/d²) dd → so dd = - d² dp → since p=1/d, d=1/p, so dd = (1/p²) dp.

So the volume of a thin shell at distance d is 4πd² dd. So substituting, 4πd² * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^2) (1/p^2) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, the number of stars in this shell is 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of p (dp) is ~1/p^4.

But the question is phrased as: how does the number of stars per unit range of plx change with plx? So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the units. If p is in parsecs^-1, then 1/p^4 is in parsec^4. But the number of stars is dimensionless. Hmm, that makes sense because as p increases, the number per unit p decreases.

But another approach: the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is N = n * 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp? Or is it 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp multiplied by some factor?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of flux, but no, that's not relevant here.

Wait, maybe I should consider the solid angle. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is n. So the number in a small volume dV is n dV.

But the volume element in terms of parallax is tricky. Let me think about how the volume changes with parallax.

So if I have a range of parallaxes from p to p+dp, what's the corresponding range of distances?

p = 1/d → d = 1/p. So the distance range is from d =1/p to d= 1/(p+dp). But for very small dp, this can be approximated. Let me compute the volume between d and d + dd, where dd is the change in distance.

The volume between d and d+dd is 4π (d + dd)^2 (dd) - 4π d^2 dd ≈ 4π (d^2 + 2 d dd) (dd) -4π d² dd = 4π (d^2 dd + 2 d dd²) -4π d² dd = 4π (2 d dd²). Hmm, but for small dd, dd² is negligible, so the volume is approximately 4π d^2 dd.

Wait, but that's for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. So the number of stars in this shell is n *4π d² dd.

But how does this relate to a change in parallax dp? Because p = 1/d → d =1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp (since dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp → d is 1/p, so dd = (1/p²) dp (taking absolute values)).

Substituting into the number of stars N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

So N = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So for each unit of dp, the number of stars is 4π n (1/p^4) → so the number per unit range of p is proportional to 1/p^4.

But the question is about how the number per unit range of plx (dp) changes with plx (p). So the number is proportional to 1/p^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but maybe that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises because when you're plotting number vs. parallax, the distribution isn't as straightforward.

Wait, another way: number of stars in a given range of parallax dp is proportional to the area at that distance multiplied by the thickness in distance, which is inversely proportional to p squared. But the thickness in distance is (1/p^2) dp. So the number would be proportional to (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) → 1/p^4.

So yeah, the correct answer is A) ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell \( 4\pi d^2 \) and the number density of stars \( n \), giving \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd \).

Since \( p = 1/d \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = 1/p \), and \( dd \) in terms of \( dp \) as \( dd = (1/p^2) dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = (1/p^2) dp \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot dp = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} \cdot dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This shows that as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of \( p \).

The correct answer is therefore:

**Answer: A**
