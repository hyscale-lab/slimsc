Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they need to be normalized, right? Because the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Hmm, let me check that. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squares would be 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So I think this state isn't normalized. Maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding. Because when I calculate probabilities, the state vector should have a length of 1. Otherwise, the probabilities won't add up correctly.

So the first step is to normalize the state vector. The state vector is ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 4 +1 )= sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Right?

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, let me write that out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm, I need to calculate the probability of measuring 0 when P is measured.

In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So P must be Hermitian. Let me quickly check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Looking at P, all the elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. The transpose of P would swap the off-diagonal elements. Let's see:

The (1,2) element is 1/√2. The (2,1) element is also 1/√2. Similarly, (2,3) and (3,2) are both 1/√2. The (1,3) and (3,1) are 0. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian.

Now, the next step is to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible outcomes. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then project the state ψ onto that eigenvector.

Alternatively, since the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and each has a corresponding eigenvector, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector in the state.

But perhaps another approach is to use the expectation value formula, but that gives the average, not the probability directly. Hmm. Wait, no, expectation value is the sum of each eigenvalue multiplied by its probability. But I'm interested in the probability of a specific eigenvalue, which is 0 here.

Wait, perhaps the observable P can be diagonalized, and each eigenvalue is 0, or some other values. Let me find the eigenvalues of P.

To find the eigenvalues, I'll solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix (P - λ I) is:

[ -λ   1/√2   0     ]
[1/√2  -λ    1/√2 ]
[ 0    1/√2  -λ    ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Calculating determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ something ]

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row.

det = (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ].

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (+ λ / 2 )

Third term is 0.

So determinant becomes:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (lambda/2) = 0.

Expanding (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) gives -λ^3 + (λ / 2 )

So the equation is -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) = 0.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. The second term was +lambda/2, right? Because:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (lambda/2) = 0.

So combining terms:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this: λ ( -λ^2 + 1 ) =0.

So solutions are λ = 0, and -λ^2 +1 =0 → λ^2=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes are 1, -1, 0.

The question is about the probability of getting 0. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We'll solve (P - 0 I ) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

So writing the equations:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → again, v2=0.

So from equation 3, same as equation 1, v2=0.

Thus, v2=0, and v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ v1, 0, -v1 ]^T. Let's set v1 = a, so v3= -a.

So the eigenvector is a* [1, 0, -1]^T. Or any scalar multiple.

But we can normalize it. The norm squared is (1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of this eigenvector in the state ψ.

Wait, but ψ is the given state vector, which we normalized earlier. So ψ is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So to find the amplitude, we take the inner product of ψ and the eigenvector.

Eigenvector u0 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T · (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ].

Calculating this:

= (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) ) [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ]

= (1/sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) (-2 )

So the amplitude is -2/sqrt(12) = -sqrt(12)/6 * 2? Wait, let me compute sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/(6). So the amplitude is (-2) * [1/(2 sqrt(3))] ) = - (2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude. So | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3. So the answer should be option C) 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check the normalization steps. Because I might have made a mistake in the eigenvector or state normalization.

Wait, the state was given as [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. When normalized by 1/sqrt(6), it becomes [ (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

The eigenvector u0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the inner product is [ (-1)/sqrt(6) * 1/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6) * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(6) * (-1)/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]

= [ (-2) / sqrt(12) ]

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this is (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

So the absolute value squared is (1/3).

So yes, the probability is 1/3. So the answer is option C.

The state of the system is given as the column vector \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, as the probabilities of measurement outcomes depend on the square of the components of the vector. The norm of \( \psi \) is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The observable is represented by the matrix operator \( P \), given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since \( P \) is Hermitian (symmetric), its eigenvalues represent the possible measurement outcomes. To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The matrix \( P - \lambda I \) is:

\[
P - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is calculated as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{2} = 0.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The question asks for the probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \). To find this, we determine the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) by solving \( P v = 0 \). The equations are:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \) \( \Rightarrow v_2 = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0 \) \( \Rightarrow v_3 = -v_1 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \) \( \Rightarrow v_2 = 0 \).

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing it, we get:

\[
u_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( u_0 \) in \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle u_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\langle u_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( (-1) + 0 + (-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
\left| \langle u_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
