Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles have quantized energy levels. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. The options are A, B, C, D with different multiples of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²).

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they're fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle has spin-1/2, they can have two possible spin states: up or down.

So, each energy level (n) can hold two particles, each with opposite spins. So for four particles, we need to fill up the lowest energy levels according to the Pauli principle.

First, let's think about the energy levels for a single particle. The energy levels in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²) * (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is n² E, since E is given as that term.

So for a single particle, the ground state is n=1, first excited is n=2, second is n=3, etc. But since we have four fermions, they need to fill these levels with maximum multiplicity.

Let me outline the filling process. Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So:

n=1: can hold 2 particles
n=2: can hold another 2 particles
But wait, wait. Wait, the four particles are identical fermions, so they need to have unique quantum states. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. Wait, but that would mean all four are filled into n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. Let me think: the ground state would have the lowest possible energy. So the first four particles would fill up the lowest available energy levels. But each level can only hold two.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2. So the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) )= 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's the total energy for all four particles. But the question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, wait—each state refers to the entire system's state, so the ground state is the lowest possible energy when all four are placed. Then the first excited state would be the next possible, and second excited the next.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible total energies when the system is in different excited states.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question isn't about the system's energy levels but the individual particles' energy levels. But no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So it's the total energy of the system in those states.

So for the ground state: arrange the four particles in the lowest possible energy configuration.

Each particle is a fermion, so each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So the ground state configuration would be:

n=1, spin up
n=1, spin down
n=2, spin up
n=2, spin down

Wait, no, wait. Wait, n=1 can hold two particles (since spin up and down), same for n=2. So the four particles are in n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy is (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(4 E) )= 2E + 8E =10 E.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So yes, that's correct. So the ground state energy is 10 E.

But wait, what's the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration where the energy is higher than the ground state. So perhaps moving one of the particles from a lower n to a higher n, but ensuring that the Pauli exclusion is maintained.

Wait, but let's think about what's the next possible state after the ground state. The ground state has the four particles filling n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would involve promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Let's see.

Wait, but wait: with four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The first excited state could involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. But since each level can hold two, perhaps the next higher state is when one level is filled with two, and another higher level has two.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest possible energy where all four are in the lowest possible n's.

So, ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → total energy 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state: we can have one of the n=2 particles promoted to n=3. But wait, each n can hold up to two particles. So when we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can hold two particles. So if we take two from n=2 and put one into n=3, but no, because each n can have two.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would involve having all four particles in the lowest possible arrangement, but one of them is in a higher state. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible states and their energies.

Wait, another approach: for four spin-1/2 particles, the possible ways to fill the levels are:

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles) → energy sum = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: maybe moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. So you have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, each n can hold two, so perhaps two from n=2 are split into n=2 (1) and n=3 (1). Wait, but that would give n=2 (1), n=3 (1), but each can have two. So perhaps we can have n=3 (2), but that requires taking two from lower levels. Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of the minimal energy.

Wait, no, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Each contributes 2E, 4E, 9E. So the total energy would be 2*2E + 1*4E + 1*9E =4E +4E +9E= 17E.

Wait, but let me calculate that again: 2 particles in n=1 contribute 2*1² E =2E. 1 in n=2: 1*(2² E)=4E. 1 in n=3: 1*(3² E)=9E. So sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E. Hmm, that's 15E.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Then the total energy would be 2*E1 +1*E2 +1*E3 = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state would have energy 15E.

Then the second excited state would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=2 can now have only one particle left. Or perhaps another configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has two in n=1, two in n=3, which gives 2E + 2*9E =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Then the energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3, making n=2 have one, n=3 have one. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E. Then the second excited state could have two particles in n=3, so 2*9E=18E, plus the two in n=1: 2E. So total 2E+18E=20E.

Wait, but that would be the second excited state.

Wait, but wait, let's think of possible configurations and their energies.

Another approach: the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Possible configurations:

1. (n=1,2) each with 2 particles → 2E +8E=10E → ground state.

2. (n=1,2,3) with 2,1,1 → 2E +4E +9E=15E → first excited.

3. (n=1,2,3) with 2,2,0 → no, n=3 can't have 0. Wait, no, perhaps if two are in n=3, but then n=2 can't have two? Wait, no, because you already have two in n=1 and two in n=2, but that's already four, so you can't have more. Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Alternative configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, another configuration could be: two in n=1, two in n=3 → 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E. Wait, but that would require two particles in n=3, each with opposite spins, and the two in n=1 with opposite spins. And that would give a total of four particles. So the energy would be 2E + 18E=20E. So that could be the second excited state.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, resulting in 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, but wait, each n can hold two. So if two are in n=3, then the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3, which is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. So that's the second excited state.

So the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited:15E

Second excited:20E

But looking at the options, let's check option C: 4E,10E,15E. No, but that's lower than 10E. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 20E. But looking at the options, I don't see any option that has 10,15,20.

Wait, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, so none of these match 10,15,20. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking about the energies of each particle in the system's states, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the question is about the possible energies of the system when considering different states, not the sum of all energies.

Wait, no. The question says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So it's the total energy of the system in those states.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a system of identical fermions, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies, each with their own quantum numbers and spins.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are filled as n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles), so each n=1 contributes E, n=2 contributes 4E. So two particles in n=1: 2E. Two in n=2: 8E. Sum is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: perhaps another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=2 have zero, and n=3 have two. So now, n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Energy would be 2E + 18E=20E.

So the energies would be 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none have 20E. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to n=3, but that leaves another particle in n=2, so the configuration is 2,1,1. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state might be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so now we have 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So sum:2E + 18E=20E.

But again, no option matches this. So perhaps the system's possible states have different energy levels, and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the particles can have higher quantum numbers in their arrangement. Let me list all possible arrangements for four particles.

Possible configurations:

1. All four in the lowest possible levels without any promotion beyond the ground.

Wait, but with four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → sum 10E.

2. First excited: arrange as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → sum 15E.

3. Second excited: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → sum 20E.

But in the options, I don't see 10,15,20. Let me look again at the options.

Option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Where would 18E come from?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when another particle is promoted to a higher level, like n=4. Let's see.

Suppose in the first excited state, we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E.

In the second excited state, perhaps one of the n=3 particles moves to n=4. So now, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (0), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and one in n=2 and two in n=1.

Wait, no, because the total particles would be 2+1+2=5, which is more than four.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and the others are in lower states. For example, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So the energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the system's first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another to n=4. Wait, but that would require four particles: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. That gives sum 2E +9E +16E=27E. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible arrangements. Let's think of the possible possible fillings:

Another possibility is that the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state could be when one more particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=2. Wait, but no, because that would require n=2 to have two particles. Wait, no, because if n=3 has two, and n=1 has two, that's four particles. So n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E. So 20E. Still not matching any options.

But wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm. How can 18E come about? Let's compute: 2E + 4E + 12E → that's 18E. Wait, 12 E would be n= n where n²=12 → n= sqrt(12)≈3.464, which isn't possible. So that's not possible.

Another possibility: perhaps the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → 10E (ground state). Then, for the first excited state, perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, so configuration is 2,1,1 → 15E.

For the second excited state, perhaps another particle is promoted to n=3, making 2,0,2 → energy 2E + 18E=20E.

But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2, and two in n=3. So 2 in n=2: 8E, 2 in n=3: 18E → total 26E. But that's not in the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the spin incorrectly. Wait, each n can hold two particles because of spin up and down. So maybe the ground state is when all four are in the same n, but that's impossible because of Pauli. So no, that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question isn't about the sum of all the energies but individual particle energies, but that doesn't make sense because the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system."

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a possible configuration. Let me think: four particles can be arranged as:

- All four in the lowest two levels (n=1 and n=2) → 10E (ground state).

- Then, first excited: one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → energy 15E.

- Second excited: another particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So 20E.

But again, 20E is not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming which configuration is the second excited state.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another to n=4.

Wait, but for four particles, the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Then the sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. No, that's higher than 20E, which would come from two in n=3.

Hmm, perhaps the Pauli exclusion allows for higher n's when considering different spins, but no, because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, which would require moving two from lower n's. So sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the spin, but that's impossible because the particles are spin-1/2 fermions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the possible energy levels for each individual particle, not the total system energy. But the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system," which suggests it's the system's total energy.

Wait, perhaps the way the particles are filled is different. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when all four are in n=1? No, that's impossible because each n can have two particles maximum.

So, maximum two particles in n=1. The next two go into n=2. So ground state sum is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, so configuration is 2,1,1 → sum 15E.

Second excited state: another particle is promoted to n=3, so configuration 2,0,2 → sum 20E.

But no option has 20E.

Looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, 18E would be 2E + 16E=18E, which would be if two particles are in n=1 (2E) and two in n=4 (each 16E). So sum 2E + 32E=34E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum 2E +4E +16E=22E. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3, and another to n=4. Sum would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

How can 18E be the second excited state?

18E = 2E + 16E → 2 particles in n=1 and two in n=4. But four particles in total. So 2 in n=1 and two in n=4. Sum is 2E + 2*16E= 2E +32E=34E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps one particle in n=3 and the rest in lower n's. Let's see: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E, which would be the first excited state. Then, the second excited state could be when one more particle is promoted to n=3. So 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But again, none of the options have 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, so configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers. Let's think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering only the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, ignoring the spin. But no, because each level can hold two particles.

Wait, perhaps the way the energies are calculated is different. For four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → sum 10E.

The first excited state could be n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → sum 2E + 2*9E=2E+18E=20E.

But that would make the first excited state higher than the possibilities earlier. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 20E, but I don't see that in the options. So I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that each particle's energy is (n)^2 E, and the total is the sum.

So, for four particles in the ground state: 2*(1^2) + 2*(2^2) = 2 + 8 =10E.

First excited: perhaps one particle promoted to n=3, so 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) = 2 +4 +9=15E.

Second excited: another promotion, perhaps another particle to n=3, making 2*(1^2) +0*(2^2) + 2*(3^2) )=2 +0 + 18=20E.

So the energies are 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options: none match this.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So sum is 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) +1*(4^2) =2+4+9+16=31E. But that's for four particles, which is more than four. No, wait, no, four particles: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum is 15E, which is the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum is 20E. Still no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't the minimal possible but another arrangement. For example, what if the particles are arranged as 1,1,2,2, but with higher quantum numbers? No, because each n can have two particles.

Wait, perhaps the first and second excited states are when the particles are in the same n with higher numbers, but that's not possible because of the exclusion principle.

Wait, perhaps the system allows for some higher energy states, but I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possible energies for a single particle in the system's states, but that doesn't make sense as the question refers to the system's energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the configuration for the second excited state. Let's think of the possible energy levels:

Another possibility: The ground state is 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

How?

18E would be 2E + 16E=18E. Wait, but that's 2 particles in n=1 and two in n=4. Sum is 2E + 32E=34E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So no.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that would require four particles, but the sum would be 8E +9E +16E=33E, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum 2E +18E=20E.

But again, no option matches, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum of the energies but the maximum, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimal energies for each state, considering that each state can have a certain number of particles. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is 4E, which would be if all four are in n=1, but that's impossible because of Pauli. So that can't be. So option B's ground state is 4E, which can't be correct.

Option C's ground state is 4E, which is incorrect.

Option A’s ground state is 30E, which is much higher than 10E, so that's unlikely.

Option D's ground state is 10E, which is correct.

Then the first excited state of option D is 15E, which matches our earlier calculation.

The second excited state of D is 18E. Hmm, 18E would be 2E + 16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=4 (sum 32E) plus two in n=1 (2E), which would be 34E, not 18E. So that can't be.

Wait, what's 18E in terms of the sum? 18E would be 2E + 2*(8E) → but 8E is n=2. So 2*(2^2 E)=8E. 2E + 8E*2= 2E +16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=2. So the configuration would be two in n=1, and two in n=2, which is the ground state. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think: perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But option D says 18E for the second excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But no option has that.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, but I can't assume that. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E → all multiples of E but higher than our calculated values.

B)4E,10E,50E → 4E would require all four in n=1, which is impossible.

C)4E,10E,15E → again, 4E is impossible.

D)10E,15E,18E → ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So, perhaps the second excited state is 18E, but how?

Wait, maybe if I promote one particle to n=4 instead of n=3, the sum would be 2E +4E +16E=22E, which is not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would sum to 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another is promoted to n=3, making 2 in n=3 and 2 in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E, which is not 18E.

I'm stuck. Since among the options, D is the only one with 10E as the ground state, and 15E as the first excited state, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require four particles: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → sum 20E.

But option D says 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something in the way the particles are arranged.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has one particle in n=2, two in n=3, and one in n=4. But that would sum to 4E +18E +16E=38E, which is option A's second excited state, but that's way higher.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one each in n=3 and n=4. No, that would require four particles: 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Sum 8E +9E +16E=33E.

This isn't getting me anywhere. I think I'll have to make a decision based on the options and what I know. The ground state is 10E, first excited 15E. Looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E.

So, perhaps the second excited state is 18E, but I'm not sure how. Maybe I'll go with option D as the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles, corresponding to the two possible spin states (up and down).

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. The first two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (with opposite spins), and the next two occupy \( n=2 \). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (2 particles), \( n=2 \) (1 particle), and \( n=3 \) (1 particle). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), leaving \( n=2 \) with no particles and \( n=3 \) with two particles. The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (2 particles) and \( n=3 \) (2 particles). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E):** These values are much higher than the calculated energies and are inconsistent with the ground state energy of \( 10E \).
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E):** The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect, as it would imply all four particles are in \( n=1 \), which violates the Pauli exclusion principle.
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E):** The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect for the same reason as in Option B.
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E):** The ground state energy of \( 10E \) and the first excited state energy of \( 15E \) match the calculations. While the second excited state energy of \( 18E \) does not match the calculated \( 20E \), it is the closest match among the given options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the best match is **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles have quantized energy levels. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. The options are A, B, C, D with different multiples of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²).

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they're fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle has spin-1/2, they can have two possible spin states: up or down.

So, each energy level (n) can hold two particles, each with opposite spins. So for four particles, we need to fill up the lowest energy levels according to the Pauli principle.

First, let's think about the energy levels for a single particle. The energy levels in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²) * (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is n² E, since E is given as that term.

So for a single particle, the ground state is n=1, first excited is n=2, second is n=3, etc. But since we have four fermions, they need to fill these levels with maximum multiplicity.

Let me outline the filling process. Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So:

n=1: can hold 2 particles
n=2: can hold another 2 particles
But wait, wait. Wait, the four particles are identical fermions, so they need to have unique quantum states. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. Wait, but that would mean all four are filled into n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. Let me think: the ground state would have the lowest possible energy. So the first four particles would fill up the lowest available energy levels. But each level can only hold two.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2. So the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) )= 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's the total energy for all four particles. But the question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, wait—each state refers to the entire system's state, so the ground state is the lowest possible energy when all four are placed. Then the first excited state would be the next possible, and second excited the next.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible total energies when the system is in different excited states.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question isn't about the system's energy levels but the individual particles' energy levels. But no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So it's the total energy of the system in those states.

So for the ground state: arrange the four particles in the lowest possible energy configuration.

Each particle is a fermion, so each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So the ground state configuration would be:

n=1, spin up
n=1, spin down
n=2, spin up
n=2, spin down

Wait, no, wait. Wait, n=1 can hold two particles (since spin up and down), same for n=2. So the four particles are in n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy is (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(4 E) )= 2E + 8E =10 E.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So yes, that's correct. So the ground state energy is 10 E.

But wait, what's the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration where the energy is higher than the ground state. So perhaps moving one of the particles from a lower n to a higher n, but ensuring that the Pauli exclusion is maintained.

Wait, but let's think about what's the next possible state after the ground state. The ground state has the four particles filling n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would involve promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Let's see.

Wait, but wait: with four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The first excited state could involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. But since each level can hold two, perhaps the next higher state is when one level is filled with two, and another higher level has two.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest possible energy where all four are in the lowest possible n's.

So, ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → total energy 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state: we can have one of the n=2 particles promoted to n=3. But wait, each n can hold up to two particles. So when we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can hold two particles. So if we take two from n=2 and put one into n=3, but no, because each n can have two.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would involve having all four particles in the lowest possible arrangement, but one of them is in a higher state. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible states and their energies.

Wait, another approach: for four spin-1/2 particles, the possible ways to fill the levels are:

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles) → energy sum = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: maybe moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. So you have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, each n can hold two, so perhaps two from n=2 are split into n=2 (1) and n=3 (1). Wait, but that would give n=2 (1), n=3 (1), but each can have two. So perhaps we can have n=3 (2), but that requires taking two from lower levels. Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of the minimal energy.

Wait, no, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Each contributes 2E, 4E, 9E. So the total energy would be 2*2E + 1*4E + 1*9E =4E +4E +9E= 17E.

Wait, but let me calculate that again: 2 particles in n=1 contribute 2*1² E =2E. 1 in n=2: 1*(2² E)=4E. 1 in n=3: 1*(3² E)=9E. So sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E. Hmm, that's 15E.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Then the total energy would be 2*E1 +1*E2 +1*E3 = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state would have energy 15E.

Then the second excited state would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=2 can now have only one particle left. Or perhaps another configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has two in n=1, two in n=3, which gives 2E + 2*9E =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Then the energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3, making n=2 have one, n=3 have one. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E. Then the second excited state could have two particles in n=3, so 2*9E=18E, plus the two in n=1: 2E. So total 2E+18E=20E.

Wait, but that would be the second excited state.

Wait, but wait, let's think of possible configurations and their energies.

Another approach: the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Possible configurations:

1. (n=1,2) each with 2 particles → 2E +8E=10E → ground state.

2. (n=1,2,3) with 2,1,1 → 2E +4E +9E=15E → first excited.

3. (n=1,2,3) with 2,2,0 → no, n=3 can't have 0. Wait, no, perhaps if two are in n=3, but then n=2 can't have two? Wait, no, because you already have two in n=1 and two in n=2, but that's already four, so you can't have more. Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Alternative configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, another configuration could be: two in n=1, two in n=3 → 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E. Wait, but that would require two particles in n=3, each with opposite spins, and the two in n=1 with opposite spins. And that would give a total of four particles. So the energy would be 2E + 18E=20E. So that could be the second excited state.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, resulting in 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, but wait, each n can hold two. So if two are in n=3, then the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3, which is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. So that's the second excited state.

So the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited:15E

Second excited:20E

But looking at the options, let's check option C: 4E,10E,15E. No, but that's lower than 10E. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 20E. But looking at the options, I don't see any option that has 10,15,20.

Wait, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, so none of these match 10,15,20. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking about the energies of each particle in the system's states, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the question is about the possible energies of the system when considering different states, not the sum of all energies.

Wait, no. The question says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So it's the total energy of the system in those states.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a system of identical fermions, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies, each with their own quantum numbers and spins.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are filled as n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles), so each n=1 contributes E, n=2 contributes 4E. So two particles in n=1: 2E. Two in n=2: 8E. Sum is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: perhaps another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=2 have zero, and n=3 have two. So now, n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Energy would be 2E + 18E=20E.

So the energies would be 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none have 20E. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to n=3, but that leaves another particle in n=2, so the configuration is 2,1,1. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state might be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so now we have 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So sum:2E + 18E=20E.

But again, no option matches this. So perhaps the system's possible states have different energy levels, and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the particles can have higher quantum numbers in their arrangement. Let me list all possible arrangements for four particles.

Possible configurations:

1. All four in the lowest possible levels without any promotion beyond the ground.

Wait, but with four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → sum 10E.

2. First excited: arrange as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → sum 15E.

3. Second excited: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → sum 20E.

But in the options, I don't see 10,15,20. Let me look again at the options.

Option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Where would 18E come from?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when another particle is promoted to a higher level, like n=4. Let's see.

Suppose in the first excited state, we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E.

In the second excited state, perhaps one of the n=3 particles moves to n=4. So now, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (0), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and one in n=2 and two in n=1.

Wait, no, because the total particles would be 2+1+2=5, which is more than four.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and the others are in lower states. For example, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So the energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the system's first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another to n=4. Wait, but that would require four particles: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. That gives sum 2E +9E +16E=27E. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible arrangements. Let's think of the possible possible fillings:

Another possibility is that the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state could be when one more particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=2. Wait, but no, because that would require n=2 to have two particles. Wait, no, because if n=3 has two, and n=1 has two, that's four particles. So n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E. So 20E. Still not matching any options.

But wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm. How can 18E come about? Let's compute: 2E + 4E + 12E → that's 18E. Wait, 12 E would be n= n where n²=12 → n= sqrt(12)≈3.464, which isn't possible. So that's not possible.

Another possibility: perhaps the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → 10E (ground state). Then, for the first excited state, perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, so configuration is 2,1,1 → 15E.

For the second excited state, perhaps another particle is promoted to n=3, making 2,0,2 → energy 2E + 18E=20E.

But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2, and two in n=3. So 2 in n=2: 8E, 2 in n=3: 18E → total 26E. But that's not in the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the spin incorrectly. Wait, each n can hold two particles because of spin up and down. So maybe the ground state is when all four are in the same n, but that's impossible because of Pauli. So no, that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question isn't about the sum of all the energies but individual particle energies, but that doesn't make sense because the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system."

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a possible configuration. Let me think: four particles can be arranged as:

- All four in the lowest two levels (n=1 and n=2) → 10E (ground state).

- Then, first excited: one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → energy 15E.

- Second excited: another particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So 20E.

But again, 20E is not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming which configuration is the second excited state.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another to n=4.

Wait, but for four particles, the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Then the sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. No, that's higher than 20E, which would come from two in n=3.

Hmm, perhaps the Pauli exclusion allows for higher n's when considering different spins, but no, because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, which would require moving two from lower n's. So sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the spin, but that's impossible because the particles are spin-1/2 fermions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the possible energy levels for each individual particle, not the total system energy. But the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system," which suggests it's the system's total energy.

Wait, perhaps the way the particles are filled is different. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when all four are in n=1? No, that's impossible because each n can have two particles maximum.

So, maximum two particles in n=1. The next two go into n=2. So ground state sum is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, so configuration is 2,1,1 → sum 15E.

Second excited state: another particle is promoted to n=3, so configuration 2,0,2 → sum 20E.

But no option has 20E.

Looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, 18E would be 2E + 16E=18E, which would be if two particles are in n=1 (2E) and two in n=4 (each 16E). So sum 2E + 32E=34E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum 2E +4E +16E=22E. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3, and another to n=4. Sum would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

How can 18E be the second excited state?

18E = 2E + 16E → 2 particles in n=1 and two in n=4. But four particles in total. So 2 in n=1 and two in n=4. Sum is 2E + 2*16E= 2E +32E=34E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps one particle in n=3 and the rest in lower n's. Let's see: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E, which would be the first excited state. Then, the second excited state could be when one more particle is promoted to n=3. So 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But again, none of the options have 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, so configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers. Let's think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering only the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, ignoring the spin. But no, because each level can hold two particles.

Wait, perhaps the way the energies are calculated is different. For four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → sum 10E.

The first excited state could be n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → sum 2E + 2*9E=2E+18E=20E.

But that would make the first excited state higher than the possibilities earlier. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 20E, but I don't see that in the options. So I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that each particle's energy is (n)^2 E, and the total is the sum.

So, for four particles in the ground state: 2*(1^2) + 2*(2^2) = 2 + 8 =10E.

First excited: perhaps one particle promoted to n=3, so 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) = 2 +4 +9=15E.

Second excited: another promotion, perhaps another particle to n=3, making 2*(1^2) +0*(2^2) + 2*(3^2) )=2 +0 + 18=20E.

So the energies are 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options: none match this.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So sum is 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) +1*(4^2) =2+4+9+16=31E. But that's for four particles, which is more than four. No, wait, no, four particles: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum is 15E, which is the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum is 20E. Still no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't the minimal possible but another arrangement. For example, what if the particles are arranged as 1,1,2,2, but with higher quantum numbers? No, because each n can have two particles.

Wait, perhaps the first and second excited states are when the particles are in the same n with higher numbers, but that's not possible because of the exclusion principle.

Wait, perhaps the system allows for some higher energy states, but I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possible energies for a single particle in the system's states, but that doesn't make sense as the question refers to the system's energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the configuration for the second excited state. Let's think of the possible energy levels:

Another possibility: The ground state is 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

How?

18E would be 2E + 16E=18E. Wait, but that's 2 particles in n=1 and two in n=4. Sum is 2E + 32E=34E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So no.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that would require four particles, but the sum would be 8E +9E +16E=33E, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum 2E +18E=20E.

But again, no option matches, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum of the energies but the maximum, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimal energies for each state, considering that each state can have a certain number of particles. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is 4E, which would be if all four are in n=1, but that's impossible because of Pauli. So that can't be. So option B's ground state is 4E, which can't be correct.

Option C's ground state is 4E, which is incorrect.

Option A’s ground state is 30E, which is much higher than 10E, so that's unlikely.

Option D's ground state is 10E, which is correct.

Then the first excited state of option D is 15E, which matches our earlier calculation.

The second excited state of D is 18E. Hmm, 18E would be 2E + 16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=4 (sum 32E) plus two in n=1 (2E), which would be 34E, not 18E. So that can't be.

Wait, what's 18E in terms of the sum? 18E would be 2E + 2*(8E) → but 8E is n=2. So 2*(2^2 E)=8E. 2E + 8E*2= 2E +16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=2. So the configuration would be two in n=1, and two in n=2, which is the ground state. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think: perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But option D says 18E for the second excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But no option has that.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, but I can't assume that. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E → all multiples of E but higher than our calculated values.

B)4E,10E,50E → 4E would require all four in n=1, which is impossible.

C)4E,10E,15E → again, 4E is impossible.

D)10E,15E,18E → ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So, perhaps the second excited state is 18E, but how?

Wait, maybe if I promote one particle to n=4 instead of n=3, the sum would be 2E +4E +16E=22E, which is not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would sum to 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another is promoted to n=3, making 2 in n=3 and 2 in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E, which is not 18E.

I'm stuck. Since among the options, D is the only one with 10E as the ground state, and 15E as the first excited state, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require four particles: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → sum 20E.

But option D says 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something in the way the particles are arranged.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has one particle in n=2, two in n=3, and one in n=4. But that would sum to 4E +18E +16E=38E, which is option A's second excited state, but that's way higher.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one each in n=3 and n=4. No, that would require four particles: 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Sum 8E +9E +16E=33E.

This isn't getting me anywhere. I think I'll have to make a decision based on the options and what I know. The ground state is 10E, first excited 15E. Looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E.

So, perhaps the second excited state is 18E, but I'm not sure how. Maybe I'll go with option D as the answer.


The problem involves calculating the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles, corresponding to the two possible spin states (up and down).

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. The first two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (with opposite spins), and the next two occupy \( n=2 \). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (2 particles), \( n=2 \) (1 particle), and \( n=3 \) (1 particle). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), leaving \( n=2 \) with no particles and \( n=3 \) with two particles. The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (2 particles) and \( n=3 \) (2 particles). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E):** These values are much higher than the calculated energies and are inconsistent with the ground state energy of \( 10E \).
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E):** The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect, as it would imply all four particles are in \( n=1 \), which violates the Pauli exclusion principle.
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E):** The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect for the same reason as in Option B.
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E):** The ground state energy of \( 10E \) and the first excited state energy of \( 15E \) match the calculations. While the second excited state energy of \( 18E \) does not match the calculated \( 20E \), it is the closest match among the given options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the best match is **Option D**.
