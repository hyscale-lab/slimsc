Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The question is asking for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator given has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix because the electron spin is either up or down. Let me think about what that matrix looks like.

The matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 when i ≠ j. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements would be zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices go from 1 to 2. So when i is 1 and j is 2, and vice versa, it's non-zero. So the matrix is:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0      ]

Wait, no, wait again. No, the problem says A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, hbar/2
Row 2: hbar/2, 0

So, that makes the operator A equal to (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X swaps the basis states. But wait, the Pauli X matrix has 1s in the off-diagonal, so A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

So, the operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. Now, since sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become (hbar/2) and -(hbar/2). So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x, the eigenstates being (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 scaled by hbar/2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the eigenstates of the operator A. So the eigenstates are those two I just mentioned.

So, the state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I need to normalize it first, I think, because the question says it's "proportional to" that expression. So let's compute the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> can be written as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> to find the normalization.

Compute |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because for a two-dimensional state, the norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Wait, |1 + i| is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so |1+i|^2 is 2.

Similarly, |2 - i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5), so |2 - i|^2 is 5.

So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that, so I think that's correct.

Now, the next part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)}.

But wait, the eigenstates of A are |+A> and |-A>, which are |+x> and |−x>, because A is proportional to sigma_x.

So the eigenstates are:

|+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-A> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), which are the same as the eigenstates of A, because A is a multiple of sigma_x.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to write |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the coefficients, then take the square of their magnitudes as the probabilities.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+A> and |-A>.

Let me denote |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+A> + c_- |−A>

So, substituting the expressions for |+A> and |−A>, we get:

|alpha> = c_+ [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + c_- [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me factor this out:

= [ c_+ / sqrt(2) + c_- / sqrt(2) ] |up> 
+ [ c_+ / sqrt(2) - c_- / sqrt(2) ] |down>

But the given |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, equating the coefficients:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2) ) ]

(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me call these equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1): (1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2)
Equation (2): (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2)

Let me solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations (1) and (2):

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ 2 c_+ ] / sqrt(2)
(3) / sqrt(7) = 2 c_+ / sqrt(2)
So c_+ = [ 3 / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) / 2
= (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from (1):

[ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ 2 c_- ] / sqrt(2)
=> ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7) = 2 c_- / sqrt(2)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) / 2
= ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, let's compute [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] equals 3 +0i, right? 1+2 is 3, i -i is 0.

So (3)/(sqrt(7)) = [2 c_+ ] / sqrt(2)
Multiply both sides by sqrt(2)/2:

c_+ = (3 * sqrt(2)) / (2 * sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from (1):

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ 2 c_- ] / sqrt(2)
Thus, c_- = [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Let me compute |c_+|²:

c_+ is (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |c_+|² = [ (3^2) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2^2) * (sqrt(7))^2 )
= (9 * 2) / (4 *7)
= 18/(28)
= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |c_-|²:

c_- is [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

First, compute the magnitude squared of the numerator:

(-1 +2i) has magnitude sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1+4) = sqrt(5).

So the numerator's magnitude is sqrt(5) * sqrt(2) = sqrt(10).

Denominator is 2 sqrt(7), so magnitude squared is (sqrt(10))² / (2 sqrt(7))² = 10/(4 *7) )= 10/28=5/14 ≈ 0.357142...

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the expression is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude of (-1 +2i) is sqrt(5), so the magnitude of the numerator is sqrt(5) * sqrt(2), and the denominator is 2 sqrt(7).

So |c_-|² is (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))² / (2 sqrt(7))² ) → (5*2)/(4*7) ) = 10/(28) )=5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approx 0.642857, and 5/14 is approx 0.357. Hmm, but the options given don't have 9/14 and 5/14. Let me look at the options.

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357 which rounds to 0.36. So that would match option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculations again. Because sometimes when dealing with these coefficients, I might have made a mistake.

Another approach: Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to find these coefficients without going through this algebra. Because the operator A has eigenstates |+A> and |-A>, and I can express |alpha> in terms of them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, which would give me the coefficients c_+ and c_-, and then their squares would be the probabilities.

Let me try that approach.

First, compute c_+ = < +A | alpha >.

|+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +A | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * |alpha>.

|alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So,

< +A | alpha > = [ ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (3 + 0i) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
= 3 / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )
= 3 / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is (3^2) / 14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is about 0.64.

Similarly, compute c_- = < -A | alpha >.

| -A > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

< -A | alpha > = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * |alpha>
= [ ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ ( (1-2) + (i +i) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357142, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%, which matches option A: 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, for the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, the average value is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) * (+1) + |c_-|^2 * (hbar/2)*(-1).

Wait, because the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2) and (-hbar/2) for |+A> and |-A> respectively.

So, average value would be |c_+|² * (hbar/2) + |c_-|² * (-hbar/2).

From earlier, |c_+|² is 9/14, |c_-|² is 5/14.

So,

average = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) ] * (hbar/2)
= (4/14) * (hbar/2)
= (2/7) * (hbar/2)
= hbar /7.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait,

<alpha|A|alpha> = |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2)

Which is:

(9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= (9hbar/(28)) - (5hbar/(28))
= (4 hbar)/(28)
= hbar/(7)

So the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Probabilities 0.64, 0.36; average hbar/7.

So the correct answer would be option A.

The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ ∝ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm:

\[
\|α\|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

These are also the eigenstates of A, with eigenvalues \( +\hbar/2 \) and \( -\hbar/2 \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩
The state |α⟩ can be written as:

\[
|α⟩ = c_{+} |+x⟩ + c_{-} |-x⟩.
\]

Substituting the expressions for |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{c_{+}}{\sqrt{2}} |up⟩ + \frac{c_{+}}{\sqrt{2}} |down⟩ + \frac{c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}} |up⟩ - \frac{c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}} |down⟩.
\]

Grouping coefficients:

\[
|α⟩ = \left( \frac{c_{+} + c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) |up⟩ + \left( \frac{c_{+} - c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) |down⟩.
\]

Comparing with the normalized |α⟩:

\[
\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{c_{+} + c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{c_{+} - c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Solving for \( c_{+} \) and \( c_{-} \):

1. Adding the two equations:

\[
\frac{1+i + 2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{2c_{+}}{\sqrt{2}} \implies c_{+} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

2. Subtracting the two equations:

\[
\frac{1+i - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{2c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}} \implies c_{-} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are \( |c_{+}|^2 \) and \( |c_{-}|^2 \), respectively.

1. Compute \( |c_{+}|^2 \):

\[
|c_{+}|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

2. Compute \( |c_{-}|^2 \):

\[
|c_{-}|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_{+}|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_{-}|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substitute \( |c_{+}|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_{-}|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \hbar/7 \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
