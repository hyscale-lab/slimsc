Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta and how far it travels from different reference frames. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta would be moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, velocities are just reversed. So if the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving at 60,000 km/s towards it, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

The question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? Oh, right, time can be different between frames. So this must involve time dilation because of special relativity.

Wait, time dilation occurs when there's a relative velocity between frames. The faster you go, the more time slows down from the perspective of a stationary observer. So I think I need to calculate the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where t' is the dilated time (the time in the moving frame), and t is the proper time (the time in the rest frame). Wait, no, actually, the formula is t' = gamma (t + (v x)/c²), but in this case, since the motion is directly towards each other, x would be the position. Hmm, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, no. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (e.g., the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. So if the ejecta is moving, then in the Galaxy's frame, more time would pass than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The person on the ejecta measures their own time as 50 seconds. From their frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v = 60,000 km/s. So the Galaxy's frame would see a longer time passing for the same event. So the time t in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

So the formula is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time (50 seconds) and t is the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure about which frame is which. The ejecta is moving at v relative to the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v. So the ejecta's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy.

So in the Galaxy frame, the time between the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) is longer. So t = gamma * t' * (1 + (v x')/(c² t')) ), but wait, perhaps x' is zero because the events happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame. Because the ejecta is at rest, so x' is 0. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end) are at the same location, so x' is 0. Then the time dilation formula becomes t = gamma * t'. So yes, so the Galaxy's frame will see more time passing.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second because SI units are probably easier. 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, wait, no: 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km/s is 60,000 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s? Wait, 60,000 km = 6e4 km = 6e7 meters. So 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, 1 km/s = 1e3 m/s. So 60,000 km/s is 60,000 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

But the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v = 6e7 m/s.

So v/c = 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So v is 0.2c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 (approximating sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98? Wait, wait: let's compute it accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.96) is the same as sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Hmm, sqrt(24) is about 4.89898, so sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98 approximately. So gamma is approximately 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204. But wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96 * 1e-2) )= sqrt(96)*1e-1. sqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6)=4*sqrt(6)=4*2.4495 ≈ 9.798. So sqrt(96) is approx 9.798, so sqrt(0.96)= 0.98 approximately, which is correct.

So gamma is 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204. So time in the Galaxy frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 s ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the time in the ejecta's frame is t' = 50 seconds. So in the Galaxy frame, the same event takes longer. So t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 *50 ≈ 51.02 s.

But wait, wait: no, that's only when the events are at the same place. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the event is the ejecta moving from one point to another. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as t, which is gamma * t'.

Wait, but in any case, the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, right? Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v for a time t, so distance is v * t.

So v is 6e7 m/s, t is approximately 51.02 s. So distance is 6e7 m/s * 51.02 s = 3.0612e9 meters. Let me convert that to kilometers: 3.0612e9 meters is 3,061,200 km. So approximately 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So I think that's the right answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit worried about the exact calculation of gamma. Let me compute it more accurately.

v = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s.

v/c = 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2.

So v^2/c^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = 0.9797958971 (approximately). So 1 / 0.9797958971 = approximately 1.020305.

So gamma is about 1.020305.

So t = 50 s * 1.020305 ≈ 50 * 1.020305 = 51.01525 seconds.

So distance = v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.01525 s.

Wait, wait: wait, v is 6e4 km/s? No, wait, v is 60,000 km/s, which is 6e4 km/s. So 6e4 km/s multiplied by 51.01525 s is 6e4 * 51.01525 = 6 * 51.01525 * 1e4 = 306.0915e4 km. 306.0915e4 is 3,060,915 km. Hmmm, so about 3,060,915 km. The closest option is D, 3,060,000 km.

So, I think the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta and its distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame over 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Since both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, we apply special relativity to account for time dilation.

### Key Information:
1. **Relative Velocity**: From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Conversely, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves towards the center at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).
2. **Time in Ejecta Frame**: \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \).
3. **Time Dilation**: The relationship between time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) and the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is given by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

### Calculation of \( \gamma \):
- \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^4 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \).
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so \( v/c = 0.2 \).
- \( v^2/c^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04 \).
- \( 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.96 \).
- \( \sqrt{0.96} \approx 0.9798 \), so \( \gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \approx 1.0203 \).

### Time in Galaxy's Frame:
\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Distance Traveled in Galaxy's Frame:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:
\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t.
\]
- \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).
- \( t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \).
- \[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.015 \, \text{s} = 3,060,900 \, \text{km}.
\]

### Closest Option:
The calculated distance (\( 3,060,900 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**.
