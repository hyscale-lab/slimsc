Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels from the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the problem says that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So that means we can apply special relativity here, right? Because in inertial frames, the laws of physics are the same, and we don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that.

The ejecta part is moving towards the center of the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at the same speed, right? Because velocities are relative between the frames. So, when the ejecta is approaching the galaxy, the galaxy is approaching the ejecta with equal speed in opposite directions in their respective frames.

So, the problem is about time dilation and distance contraction in special relativity. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame will be different. So the key here is to find out how much time passes in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

I remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is t' = gamma * t, where t is the time in the galaxy frame and t' is the time in the ejecta frame. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: in special relativity, if an event occurs at the same place in one frame, then in another frame moving relative to it, the time is longer. So for example, if a clock is moving, its time runs slower from the perspective of the stationary frame. So, if the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the galaxy, then the galaxy frame would see the ejecta's clock running slow.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's define the galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. The ejecta (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. So from S's perspective, the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. So if 50 seconds pass in S' (the ejecta's frame), how much time passes in S (the galaxy's frame)?

The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, which direction is the velocity? Here, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, so the velocity v is the speed of the ejecta as observed from the galaxy. So, from S (galaxy) to S' (ejecta), the velocity is v (positive in the direction towards the galaxy). So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2c. Because 60,000 is 6e4, and c is 3e5, so 6e4 /3e5 = 0.2. So v is 0.2c.

So gamma would be 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 )) = 1/(sqrt(0.96)) ≈ let's calculate that. sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's see: 0.96 is 24^2/25^2, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, compute 1 - 0.04, so the square root is about 1 - (0.04/2) = 0.98 (approx), but that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.96^0.5 is approximately 0.9798, so 1/0.9798 is about 1.0206.

So gamma is about 1.0206.

But wait, the time in S' is t' =50 seconds. So the time in S is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. Which frame is which? Because when the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it, then the ejecta's frame S' is moving at -v relative to the galaxy S. Wait, no: in the galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v. So in the S' frame (ejecta's), the galaxy is moving towards them at v as well, but the direction is opposite. So velocity in S is v, and in S' it's -v. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of relative velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the problem more formally.

The galaxy's frame is S, and the ejecta's frame is S'. The velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (galaxy) is v = +60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the center, which is the same direction as the galaxy's center, so if the galaxy is at rest, the ejecta is approaching at v). So from S's perspective, S' is moving at +v. So in S, the time that passes when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds is t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, no: in the S frame, the S' frame is moving. So any time measured in S' would be dilated in S. So if in S', 50 seconds pass, in S, the same event would take longer. So t = gamma * t'.

So t = 50 * gamma ≈ 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but the question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the distance is velocity multiplied by time in the galaxy's frame.

Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v =60,000 km/s. So distance is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But wait, no. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, so the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So if t is 51.03 seconds, then distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close to that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let's compute gamma accurately. v =0.2c, c is 3e5 km/s.

v =6e4 km/s.

So v^2 = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km/s)^2.

c^2 is (3e5)^2 =9e10 (km/s)^2.

So 1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1 - (3.6e9 /9e10 ) = 1 - (0.04) = 0.96.

So gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.96)).

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

We know that 0.96 is 24^2 /25^2, because 24^2=576, 25^2=625. So 576/625 =0.9216. Oh wait, no, 24^2 is 576, but 576/625 is 0.9216, which is less than 0.96. Hmm, perhaps a better approximation is needed.

Alternatively, using the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) where x is 0.04.

sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8.

So for x=0.04,

sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - 0.02 - (0.0016)/8 = 1 -0.02 -0.0002= 0.9798.

So gamma =1/0.9798 ≈1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So distance in galaxy's frame: v * t =6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈6e4 *51.03.

Compute 6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 *50 =3,000,000.

60,000 *1.03=60,000 *1 +60,000 *0.03=60,000 +1,800=61,800.

So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

3,061,800 is approximately 3,060,000, so option D is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives a different value.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the time dilation factor. Because the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is t', and the galaxy's frame will see t = gamma t'.

But wait, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, more time has passed, so the ejecta would have moved a longer distance in the galaxy's frame. So yes, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction.

Wait, no, the distance in the galaxy's frame is based on the time in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v for t = gamma * t' seconds, so distance is v * t.

Another approach: The distance in the galaxy's frame is the same as the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during time t.

Wait, yes, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, so distance is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

Yes, I think that's correct.

So the calculation gives approximately 3,061,800 km, which is close to option D, 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the exact gamma without approximations.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.96).

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

We can use the Newton-Raphson method to find sqrt(0.96).

Let me approximate sqrt(0.96).

Let me take an initial guess x0 = 0.98 (since 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is very close to 0.96).

Compute x0^2 = 0.9604.

We want x where x^2=0.96.

So x1 = (x0 + 0.96/x0)/2.

x0=0.98.

x1= (0.98 + 0.96/(0.98)) /2.

0.96 /0.98 = approx 0.97959.

So x1 = (0.98 +0.97959)/2 = (1.95959)/2= 0.979795.

x1^2 = (0.979795)^2.

Let me compute that.

0.979795^2 = (0.98 - 0.000205)^2.

= 0.98^2 - 2 *0.98 * 0.000205 + (0.000205)^2.

= 0.9604 - 0.000398 + ~0.000000042.

= 0.9604 - 0.000398 ≈0.960002.

Which is very close to 0.96.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈0.9797956.

So gamma ≈1/0.9797956 ≈1.02062.

So t=50 *1.02062 ≈51.031 seconds.

So distance is 6e4 km/s *51.031 s =6e4 *51.031.

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 *51.031=60,000 *51 +60,000 *0.031.

60,000 *51 =3,060,000.

60,000 *0.031=1,860.

Total is 3,060,000 +1,860= 3,061,860 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. Which is the closest, though not exactly matching.

But perhaps the options are approximate, so the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake. Maybe the problem is to find the distance in the galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame time is 50 seconds. So using t=gamma * t' gives the time in the galaxy's frame, which is multiplied by velocity to get the distance.

So 60,000 km/s *51.03 s ≈3,061,800 km.

Which is approximately 3,060,000 km. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but another possibility: Could there be a miscalculation in the direction? Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So perhaps the problem is considering relative velocity in the opposite direction. But no, because from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy, so the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about length contraction. But in this case, the distance the ejecta travels is in the galaxy's frame, so it's straightforward.

I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 3,061,800 km, so the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy using principles of special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the ejecta is moving at a velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)) towards the Galaxy's center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy appears to move towards it at the same speed. The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, time dilation occurs between two inertial frames moving relative to each other. The relationship between the time intervals is given by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where \( t' \) is the time in the ejecta's frame, \( t \) is the time in the Galaxy's frame, and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  
   Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a constant velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   d = v \cdot t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the calculation of \( \gamma \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.
