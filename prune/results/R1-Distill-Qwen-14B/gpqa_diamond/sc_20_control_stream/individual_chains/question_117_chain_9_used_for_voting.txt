Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, that's when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So, if a compound has such centers, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

Looking at the options:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different substituents on each ring. Since the substituents are in the 6 and 6' positions, and the other positions are 2,2', I'm thinking about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule isn't symmetrical, the central biphenyl might have a chiral axis or maybe some kind of stereocenter. Wait, biphenyls themselves don't have chiral centers, but if the substituents create an asymmetrical arrangement, the molecule could have enantiomers. So, I think this one might show optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. 2-Hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CH2-O-Me. The carbon in the middle (the one attached to OH, OMe, and two CH3 groups? Wait, wait. Let's see: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the formula CH3CH(OH)COO-. The ester would have methyl instead of hydrogen on the carboxylic acid. So the structure is CH3-C(O)O-CH2-CH(OH)-? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh, no, wait. Propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- as the straight chain. 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, then the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to OH, CH3COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. The carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester would have the methyl group on the COO. Let me imagine the structure: the methyl ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester, so it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)2? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3OCOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the second CH2) would have groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two Hs? Wait, no, that can't be. Because CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have the structure: the central carbon is connected to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group. Wait, wait no, the structure is:

The main chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the carbon with the OH is attached to two CH2 groups (one from the left, one to the COOCH3). So the groups attached to that carbon would be: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

CH3-COO-OCH2CH(OH)-CH3? No, that's not right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the hydroxyl is on C2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) has four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, two H's? No, wait, that can't be. Because for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So, the C2 in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 is attached to:

- OH group,
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a propionyl group linked to methyl ester),
- two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The molecule would be:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) methyl ester. So the propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, looking at the central carbon (the second carbon), connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups? Or perhaps the groups are:

Wait, the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH3 groups? No, that can't be because the chain is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to:

Group 1: OH,

Group 2: CH2COOCH3 (which is a propionyl methyl ester group),

Group 3: two CH2 groups? Wait, no, each CH2 is a carbon attached to two Hs. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should instead focus on the possibility of a chiral center. The central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3 (but wait, that's on C3),

Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH3-C(O)O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that can't be right because that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure. Let me imagine the molecule: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure where the ester is between the carbonyl and methyl. So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Its methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, the central carbon (the CH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from where? Maybe a hydrogen? No, because that would make four substituents.)

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the CH in the middle is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen? Because CH is CH2 if it's a CH2 group. Wait, no, it's a CH(OH) group, so it's attached to:

On the central carbon (the C in CH(OH)), the substituents are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (the ester group),

- and a hydrogen atom. So four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. So yes, that's a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So option 2 shows optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. So: Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, does this structure have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. No chiral centers here. Also, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the ketone group, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism here.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Wait, fumaric acid is an isomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester with two methyl groups. Structure is CH2CH(COOCH3)2, with the double bond in the trans configuration. Wait, no, perhaps it's (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2?

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in trans configuration. Wait, no, actually, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not right. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So the diethyl ester would be CH₂CH₂(COOEt)₂, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no, more precisely, it's (E)-methyl fumarate would be CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but that's not possible because that would require four substituents on each carbon of the double bond. Alternatively, each end is a COOCH3 and a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3. No, that's not correct. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans diene, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, more accurately, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But that's not a double bond. Oh, wait, no, fumarate is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key point is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For fumarate, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and each has a COOCH3 group. So the structure would be O=C-(CH₂)₂-C=O, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that's not the same as fumarate.

Wait, wait, I'm confusing maleate and fumarate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O-C-OCH3
|
O

But that can't be right because that would have a single bond between the two CH₂ groups. So I think the correct structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but in the trans configuration. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? No, because the central double bond is in a trans configuration. Wait, but wait: the molecule would have two identical groups on each end. So, each CH2 group is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So no chiral centers here. But wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Yes, but that's different from optical isomerism. For a compound to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Each of these carbons is attached to two identical groups (the COOCH3 groups). So the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, some sources say that in some cases, even without chiral centers, certain molecules can have optical activity. But I think that's not the case here.

Wait, wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake. Because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical because the two ends are mirror images. So no, it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I'm recalling that in some cases, diastereomers can include geometric isomerism. But optical isomerism is about enantiomers which require a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, the molecule may have no chiral centers, but due to a lack of a plane of symmetry, it becomes chiral. For example, 1,2-dichloroethylene is not chiral, but 1,1-dichloroethylene is. Wait, no, 1,2-dichloroethylene has a plane of symmetry. So I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: to have optical isomerism, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry and have a center of chirality or something else that causes non-superimposable mirror images.

In dimethyl fumarate, because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides (trans), does that create a chiral structure? Let me think. The molecule would have a central double bond, with each side having two identical groups. So, the two ends mirror each other. So the entire molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: if the substituents on either end are different, then the molecule could be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, both ends are the same: each has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another moment. Oh wait, fumarate is actually the trans isomer. So the structure is (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂? No, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH(COOCH3)₂, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused, but regardless, if the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of whether each substituent on the double bond is the same. For example, in maleic acid, the diastereomer would have the substituents on the same side, but in fumarate, they are on opposite sides. But regardless, the molecule's symmetry is key.

So, putting it all together:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me imagine the structure. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 6 and 6' positions and 2 and 2' positions. So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The arrangement could be such that the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents are in a way that each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, but arranged in a way that the overall molecule is not symmetrical. So, perhaps the molecule has a central single bond, and the substituents on each benzene ring are arranged in a way that creates chirality. Alternatively, the biphenyl could have a chiral axis, but I'm not sure. Wait, biphenyls themselves can be chiral if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. So, if each ring has two substituents that are not mirror images, then the molecule could be chiral. In this case, each benzene ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. But if the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents on each are mirror images, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral. But if not, then it's chiral.

Wait, the way the substituents are arranged on each ring matters. Suppose the nitro groups are on opposite sides of the biphenyl bond. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a non-symmetrical way, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and hence be chiral.

Alternatively, considering that the two rings are connected via a single bond, and each has two substituents, it's possible that the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. For example, if each ring's substituents are mirrored across the central bond, the molecule would be symmetrical. But if not, then it's asymmetrical.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the question is whether the molecule has stereoisomerism. Constitutional isomers are different, but stereoisomers include both enantiomers and diastereomers.

In the case of the biphenyl, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, it can have enantiomers, hence optical isomerism.

So, given that the substituents are at 6 and 6' (assuming that the numbering is such that they are on opposite ends of the biphenyl), and 2 and 2' (on the same position on each ring), perhaps the arrangement leads to an asymmetrical structure. So, the molecule might be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they mirror each other across the central bond. In that case, the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps I should think about the possible diastereomers or enantiomers.

Another approach: some biphenyl compounds are known to have optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents on each benzene ring are not symmetrical, the molecule can be chiral. So, in this case, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate ester groups. If the arrangement on each ring makes the entire molecule asymmetrical, then it would have optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I can think of this as a possibility. So, I'll tentatively say that option 1 might have optical isomerism.

So, summarizing:

Option 1: possibly yes.

Option 2: yes.

Option 3: no.

Option 4: no.

Wait, but wait earlier when I thought about option 4, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, that can't be because that would imply each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but suppose the structure is (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, that would imply each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle. Wait, that can't be right because that would require four substituents on each carbon. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me, but that's not correct. Or perhaps it's MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me, but in the trans configuration. So each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, that structure would have each carbon in the double bond attached to a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group. So each carbon has two different substituents: for example, one carbon has COOCH3 and two CH2 groups, which might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps my confusion is leading me astray. Let me think of another approach. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have optical isomerism because it would be superimposable on its mirror image.

Dimethyl fumarate's structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, that would be a single bond, which is not fumarate. Fumarate is a trans dienoic acid. So, the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups and the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, no, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3, but with a double bond. So, O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 → no, that's not a double bond. So, correcting that, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with the double bond between the two CH₂ groups, and the substituents (COOCH3) on opposite sides.

In that case, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group. So, each carbon is attached to two different groups, making each of them a potential chiral center. Wait, no, because each carbon is connected to two CH2 groups and two COOCH3 groups? No, that's not possible because each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups. So, each carbon has two CH2 groups and one COOCH3. That can't be because each carbon in a double bond is connected to two other groups. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but regardless, if each carbon is connected to two identical groups, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't symmetrical, leading to chirality. But I'm not entirely convinced.

Wait, another way: dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester of maleic acid. So, the structure is (E)-butenedioate. The molecule is symmetrical because the two ends are mirror images. So, it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options:

1. Possibly yes.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are options 1 and 2.

Wait, but let me look back at the options given:

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, according to my analysis, options 1 and 2 have optical isomerism. So, the answer should be option D.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about option 1. Let me think again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The biphenyl has the two rings connected by a single bond. Now, in such a structure, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they mirror each other across the C-C bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the two rings are not mirror images, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, let's imagine each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The biphenyl is connected so that the two rings are attached at positions 1 and 1'. So, substituents at 6 and 6' would be opposite the point of attachment, and substituents at 2 and 2' would be adjacent.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that each ring's substituents are in the same relative positions, but the overall arrangement makes the molecule asymmetrical, then it would be chiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, but I'm not sure. Maybe in this case, the molecule is symmetrical because each ring has the same substituents, leading to a plane of symmetry. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to chirality. So, it's possible that option 1 does show optical isomerism.

Therefore, the correct answer would be options 1 and 2, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry that allow the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).

---

### **Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate ester groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The biphenyl structure can exhibit chirality if the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged asymmetrically, lacking a plane of symmetry. Given the substituents' positions, the molecule is likely asymmetrical, making it capable of optical isomerism.  

---

### **Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: OH, COOCH₃, CH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as enantiomers and exhibit optical isomerism.  

---

### **Option 3: Benzophenone**  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two benzene rings are connected to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical benzene rings and the carbonyl group, and it lacks any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

---

### **Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) diester of maleic acid, with the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule is symmetrical because the two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to identical groups (COOCH₃ and CH₂). This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Based on the analysis, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **Option 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)** and **Option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**.  

**Answer: D**
