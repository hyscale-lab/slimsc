Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. So the main point is about a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model experiment.

Alright, the setup: They identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to see the developmental fate of their interaction. So they created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs, one for the ligand and one for the receptor.

The vector's structure: The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So each is tagged with different fluorescent proteins. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of the second gene in a bicistronic mRNA.

Now, stop cassettes: Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So these are stop signals that prevent the downstream tags from being expressed unless the stop is removed, which is done by Cre-mediated recombination. Oh wait, so Cre would excise the stop cassette, allowing the GFP or mCherry to be expressed.

So if the vector is in the cell, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry only if Cre is present to remove the stop. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre would be expressed under SOX10's regulation, so in neural crest cells.

After the mice are born, they visualize under confocal. But they don't see a green signal. Green is from eGFP, which is on the receptor. So why no green?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells, I think. If they are paracrine, maybe each is expressed in different cells. But the setup here is a single vector, so both should be expressed in the same cells where Cre is active. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. So the construct isn't properly trafficked to the cell surface. If the receptor isn't on the surface, the ligand can't bind, but the question is about why eGFP isn't visible. But in the experiment, they're looking for expression of the proteins. If the receptor is stuck in Golgi, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed or detected. But in the Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin, meaning the proteins were expressed. Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocytes. So maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, the Western blot result is after transfecting the vector into astrocytes. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, suggesting that the proteins are being expressed. But in the mice, when they look for eGFP, nothing shows.

So maybe the problem isn't in expression but in whether the eGFP is correctly expressed.

Option C: Enhancer for expression missing. Both the ligand and receptor are under specific promoters. The ligand uses CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter. If the enhancer is missing, expression might be low. But in the Western blot, they saw expression. So perhaps the promoter isn't the issue here.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the ORF might have a frame shift. If the eGFP is not in frame, then when Cre removes the stop, the receptor might be expressed but without GFP. Wait, but the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is removed, the receptor would be expressed along with eGFP. If they are not in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't correctly expressed, so the Western blot might not detect it. But the Western blot was done on the transfected cells, which showed a signal proportional to actin. So maybe in the mouse, it's not expressed.

Wait, the Western was done after transfection, but the mouse model is homozygous. So the vector is integrated into the genome, and expression is under their own promoters.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is under CBA promoter, then the IRES drives the receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed. So in the presence of Cre, mCherry would be expressed along with the ligand, and eGFP along with the receptor.

In the mice, the Cre is provided by SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stop cassettes are removed, enabling expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But the problem is that when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no green signal. So why?

Maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed. If the frame is wrong, then when the stop is removed, the receptor might be expressed, but the eGFP tag isn't. So the receptor is expressed, but the GFP isn't. So in the Western blot, the overexpressed proteins were detected, but in the mouse, perhaps the eGFP isn't being translated correctly, leading to no signal.

Wait, but the Western blot was done on transfected cells, which perhaps are not the same as the mouse's expression. Or maybe the mouse construct isn't being expressed as expected.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes aren't being removed correctly. If the right Cre isn't active in the cells being examined, the stops remain, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest. Maybe the cells they're looking at aren't expressing Cre, or the Cre isn't active.

Wait, but SOX10-Cre is a transgenic line. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so in the offspring, the Cre should be active in those cells. So the vector should have the stops removed, allowing eGFP and mCherry to be expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are used by different Cre variants. Wait, loxP is the standard site, and lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre with a different recognition site, perhaps. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by the same Cre, but has a different sequence. So the same Cre can cut both.

But if the Cre isn't expressed, the stop cassettes remain, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the mice are homozygous for the construct, meaning each allele has the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous, so the offspring should have Cre expression in SOX10-expressing cells.

Wait, but maybe the expression of the Cre is not strong enough, or the cell type in which Cre is active doesn't express the ligand and receptor. Or perhaps the vector isn't being properly excised.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot was done on primary astrocytes, which are not the same as the neural crest cells. So when they transfected the vector into astrocytes, maybe the Cre wasn't present, so the stop cassettes weren't removed. But the blot shows signals proportional to actin, suggesting that the proteins were expressed. Wait, but if the stop is not removed, the mCherry and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But how would the proteins (ligand and receptor) be expressed without the tags?

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry. So if the stop isn't removed, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor is under the IRES, so its expression is dependent on the IRES. But the IRES is before the receptor, which is fused to eGFP with a stop cassette.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the vector:

5' -- CBA promoter -- ligand ORF -- loxP-stop-loxP -- mCherry -- IRES -- receptor ORF -- lox2272-stop-lox2272 -- eGFP -- 3'

So when Cre is present, it will cut the loxP sites and the lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes. So ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and receptor with eGFP.

But without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. So the ligand and receptor proteins would be present, but without their fluorescent tags.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes. If they didn't provide Cre, the stop cassettes remain, so the proteins would be expressed without the fluorescent tags. They tested the Western blot, using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they should see the ligand and receptor, but not the fluorescent proteins. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin. So the proteins are expressed. That makes sense, because the vector is transfected without Cre, so the stops are in place, and the ligand and receptor are expressed but not the tags.

But when they breed the mice and cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should be active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stops are removed, and the tags are expressed. So why no green?

Wait, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 sites aren't being properly excised. Or perhaps the vector is in an area where Cre isn't active. Or maybe the vector's expression is under an enhancer that's not active in the cells being examined.

Wait, the plasmid is a bicistronic construct, and the expression is under the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. The Cre should remove the stop cassettes, allowing the tags to be expressed.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop cassette isn't being removed. Why? Because the Cre isn't active in the cells they're looking at. But they used SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest. Unless the cells they're imaging aren't neural crest cells.

Wait, but the question says after the mice are born, they visualize them under the confocal. Maybe the cells they're looking at aren't the neural crest-derived cells. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells, so the stop remains.

Alternatively, maybe the construct is misdesigned. For example, the eGFP is not in frame after the stop cassette is removed. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not because it's in a different reading frame. That would mean the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't, so no fluorescence. But wait, the Western blot showed the presence of the ligand and receptor, which would mean that the ORFs are correctly expressed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a frame that doesn't allow proper expression. But the Western blot was done on the transfected cells, which presumably don't have Cre, so the eGFP remains stopped. So the blot would detect the ligand and receptor, but not the GFP. But in the mouse, the Cre is present, so the eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They have two copies of the vector. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, each allele has the construct, and Cre is active in neural crest cells.

So in those cells, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP along with the ligand and receptor. But no green is observed, meaning eGFP isn't expressed.

So why? If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the construct is not correctly excised. Let's think about the lox sites. The ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and uses loxP. The receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP, using lox2272. Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272. So in the presence of Cre, both stops should be removed.

But perhaps the lox sites are in a configuration that prevents excision. For example, if the vector has lox sites in a way that they form a structure that Cre can't easily access, like a tandem arrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, which is under the control of the CBA promoter for the ligand. Wait, the CBA promoter is for the ligand only; the receptor is under the IRES. So only when the first ORF (ligand) is translated, the IRES allows the receptor's translation. But if the ligand is expressed, the IRES should drive receptor expression.

But in the presence of Cre, the eGFP should be expressed. So what's wrong?

Wait, another possibility: the vector is designed in a way that the bicistronic construct has the ligand and receptor ORFs in a way that the IRES allows for the receptor's expression. But maybe the presence of the stop cassettes somehow disrupts the IRES.

Wait, the ligand is followed by a stop cassette, which is a loxP-stop-loxP. So when Cre isn't present, the ligand is expressed but not mCherry. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed with ligand, and eGFP with receptor.

But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed, so the IRES must be working.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed, but it's not being detected because of improper folding or other reasons. But the question says there's no green signal, implying it's not expressed.

Going back to the options, option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't trafficking to the cell surface, perhaps it doesn't fluoresce. But the Western blot would detect the eGFP if it's expressed, regardless of its location. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, then no signal.

Wait, but the Western blot was done on transfected cells without Cre. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in those cells. So in the mouse, when Cre is present, the eGFP should be expressed. So why no green?

Another angle: perhaps the vector isn't being properly excised because the Cre isn't active in the cells, so the stop remains. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. Unless the cells they're looking at aren't expressing SOX10, so Cre isn't active. For example, if the confocal is imaging a different cell type where SOX10 isn't active.

But the question states that the offspring are visualized under the confocal. If the construct is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, which do express SOX10-Cre, then the stops should be removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector isn't properly inserted into the genome, so it's not being expressed in the mouse. But the question says the mice are homozygous, so the vector is present.

Another thought: perhaps the GFP is prone to degradation in the cells, so even if it's expressed, it's not detected. But that's speculative.

Wait, let's think about the expression in the mouse. The ligand and receptor should be expressed along with their respective fluorescent proteins in cells where Cre is active.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, it could be because the stop cassette isn't removed. But why? Maybe the Cre isn't active in those cells. Or maybe the lox sites are arranged in a way that Cre can't excise them.

Wait, the ligand's stop is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor's is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre, which recognizes loxP sites, can cut both. So in theory, both stops should be removed when Cre is active.

But wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP that has a longer sequence. So perhaps the same Cre can recognize both types. So if the Cre can recognize both, then both stops should be excised.

But maybe the lox sites are arranged as loxP followed by lox2272, which might create a different recombination outcome. Or perhaps the vector has the lox sites in a way that isn't compatible with Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps in the vector, the lox sites are in the same orientation, leading to the stops being removed and the tags being expressed.

Wait, if the loxP and lox2272 sites are in a way that the Cre can't act on both, maybe only one stop is removed, but not the other. So the mCherry might be expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But the question is about eGFP, so maybe the eGFP's stop isn't being removed.

But the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Looking at the options again, option D is about the eGFP not being in frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then when the stop is removed, the GFP isn't properly expressed. So the receptor would be expressed, but the GFP isn't, so no fluorescence.

But then, the Western blot would detect the receptor, but not the GFP. But the blot was done on transfected cells, which didn't have Cre, so the GFP wasn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that in the mouse, where Cre is active, the GFP is expressed, but the Western wouldn't have shown it.

Wait, but the question says that after transfection, the Western blot showed a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins (ligand and receptor) are expressed, but the GFP isn't, so the blot doesn't show GFP. But in the mouse, when Cre is active, the GFP should be expressed, leading to a green signal.

But in the mouse, no green. So perhaps the GFP isn't expressed.

Another thought: perhaps the vector is designed such that only the ligand is expressed, and the receptor isn't. But the vector is bicistronic, so both should be expressed.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA promoter, followed by a stop, then IRES, then the receptor. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed after the ligand is translated.

Wait, but when Cre is present, the mCherry and eGFP would be expressed along with the ligand and receptor. So the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

So in the mouse, in cells where Cre is active, you should see both mCherry and eGFP. But the question says they're not seeing eGFP.

Wait, but the question says they only see mCherry or eGFP. Or perhaps the setup is that they're looking for eGFP expression, not mCherry.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So in the presence of Cre, ligand and mCherry are expressed, and receptor and eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse, when they look under the confocal, they're not seeing a green signal (eGFP). So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

So why is eGFP not being expressed? If the stop cassette isn't being removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because Cre isn't active in those cells.

But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So if the confocal is imaging those cells, they should have Cre active.

Alternatively, maybe the vector is misdesigned so that the eGFP isn't expressed. For example, the frame might be incorrect.

Wait, the eGFP is after the receptor ORF, with a stop cassette. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor and eGFP are codirectional, so the eGFP should be expressed as a fusion or just as a tag after the receptor.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated correctly. So no eGFP, hence no green signal.

So that would point to option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

But wait, the Western blot was done on transfected cells without Cre, so the eGFP wasn't expressed, so the blot wouldn't show eGFP. But in the mouse, with Cre, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. So why would there be no eGFP in the mouse?

But the question states that the offspring have the construct, and they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, Cre is expressed, so the stops should be cut. If the eGFP is in frame, then it's expressed; if not, it isn't.

So if the eGFP isn't in frame, then in the mouse, the eGFP won't be expressed, so no green signal. That would explain the result.

Alternatively, the issue could be that the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES element isn't allowing its expression. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, which suggests that both the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, maybe the IRES is driving the receptor's expression, but the eGFP is under a separate promoter? No, the eGFP is downstream of the receptor, so it's part of the same ORF. Wait, no, the eGFP is after the receptor, but separated by the stop cassette, which is removed by Cre. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF.

So perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, it's expressed as a fusion protein. But if the frames don't match, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be option D.

Another angle: the Western blot shows the presence of the proteins, which implies that the ligand and receptor are being expressed correctly. But the eGFP isn't expressed, so the frame must be wrong. So the answer is D.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) downstream of stop cassettes that are removed by Cre-mediated recombination. The experiment involves transfecting the vector into primary astrocytes and testing expression via Western blot, followed by breeding mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice to visualize eGFP expression under confocal microscopy. Despite these efforts, no green signal (eGFP) is observed.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies the ligand and receptor act on different cells, but the vector design ensures both are co-expressed in the same cells where Cre is active. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP might not fluoresce, but the Western blot would still detect the receptor. Since the blot shows signals proportional to actin, this suggests the proteins are being expressed, making this option unlikely.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, which should allow expression. The Western blot confirms that the ligand and receptor are expressed, ruling out a missing enhancer as the cause.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The eGFP is located downstream of the receptor, separated by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. If the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor after the stop cassette is removed, it would not be properly translated, leading to no eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation of no green signal under confocal microscopy.  

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, preventing its expression and resulting in no green signal under confocal microscopy.

Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. So the main point is about a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model experiment.

But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest. Maybe the cells they're looking at aren't expressing Cre, or the Cre isn't active.

Wait, but SOX10-Cre is a transgenic line. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so in the offspring, the Cre should be active in those cells. So the vector should have the stops removed, allowing eGFP and mCherry to be expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are used by different Cre variants.

Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by the same Cre, but has a different sequence. So the same Cre can cut both.

But if the Cre isn't expressed, the stop cassettes remain, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the mice are homozygous for the construct, meaning each allele has the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous, so the offspring should have Cre expression in SOX10-expressing cells.

5' -- CBA promoter -- ligand ORF -- loxP-stop-loxP -- mCherry -- IRES -- receptor ORF -- lox2272-stop-lox2272 -- eGFP -- 3'

So when Cre is present, it will cut the loxP sites and the lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes. So ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and receptor with eGFP.

But without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. So the ligand and receptor proteins would be present, but without their fluorescent tags.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes. If they didn't provide Cre, the stop cassettes remain, so the proteins would be expressed without the fluorescent tags.

Wait, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 sites aren't being properly excised. Or perhaps the vector is in an area where Cre isn't active. Or maybe the vector's expression is under an enhancer that's not active in the cells being examined.

Wait, the plasmid is a bicistronic construct, and the expression is under the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. The Cre should remove the stop cassettes, allowing the tags to be expressed.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop cassette isn't being removed. Why? Because the Cre isn't active in the cells they're looking at. But they used SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest. Unless the cells they're imaging aren't neural crest cells.

Wait, but the question says after the mice are born, they visualize them under the confocal. Maybe the cells they're looking at aren't the neural crest-derived cells. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells, so the stop remains.

Alternatively, maybe the construct is misdesigned. For example, the eGFP is not in frame after the stop cassette is removed. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not because it's in a different reading frame. That would mean the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't, so no fluorescence. But wait, the Western blot showed the presence of the ligand and receptor, which would mean that the ORFs are correctly expressed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a frame that doesn't allow proper expression. But the Western blot was done on the transfected cells, which presumably don't have Cre, so the eGFP remains stopped. So the blot would detect the ligand and receptor, but not the GFP. But in the mouse, the Cre is present, so the eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They have two copies of the vector. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, each allele has the construct, and Cre is active in neural crest cells.

So in those cells, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP along with the ligand and receptor. But no green is observed, meaning eGFP isn't expressed.

So why? If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the construct is not correctly excised. Let's think about the lox sites. The ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and uses loxP. The receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP, using lox2272. Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272. So in the presence of Cre, both stops should be removed.

But perhaps the lox sites are in a configuration that prevents excision. For example, if the vector has lox sites in a way that they form a structure that Cre can't easily access, like a tandem arrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, which is under the control of the CBA promoter for the ligand. Wait, the CBA promoter is for the ligand only; the receptor is under the IRES. So only when the first ORF (ligand) is translated, the IRES allows the receptor's translation. But if the ligand is expressed, the IRES should drive receptor expression.

But in the presence of Cre, the eGFP should be expressed. So what's wrong?

Wait, another possibility: the vector is designed in a way that the bicistronic construct has the ligand and receptor ORFs in a way that the IRES allows for the receptor's expression. But maybe the presence of the stop cassettes somehow disrupts the IRES.

Wait, the ligand is followed by a stop cassette, which is a loxP-stop-loxP. So when Cre isn't present, the ligand is expressed but not mCherry. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed with ligand, and eGFP with receptor.

But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed, so the IRES must be working.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed, but it's not being detected because of improper folding or other reasons. But the question says there's no green signal, implying it's not expressed.

Going back to the options, option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't trafficking to the cell surface, perhaps it doesn't fluoresce. But the Western blot would detect the eGFP if it's expressed, regardless of its location. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, then no signal.

Wait, but the Western blot was done on transfected cells without Cre. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in those cells. So in the mouse, when Cre is present, the eGFP should be expressed. So why no green?

Another angle: perhaps the vector isn't being properly excised because the Cre isn't active in the cells, so the stop remains. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. Unless the cells they're looking at aren't expressing SOX10, so Cre isn't active. For example, if the confocal is imaging a different cell type where SOX10 isn't active.

But the question states that the offspring are visualized under the confocal. If the construct is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, which do express SOX10-Cre, then the stops should be removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector isn't properly inserted into the genome, so it's not being expressed in the mouse. But the question says the mice are homozygous, so the vector is present.

Another thought: perhaps the GFP is prone to degradation in the cells, so even if it's expressed, it's not detected. But that's speculative.

Wait, let's think about the expression in the mouse. The ligand and receptor should be expressed along with their respective fluorescent proteins in cells where Cre is active.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, it could be because the stop cassette isn't removed. But why? Maybe the Cre isn't active in those cells. Or maybe the lox sites are arranged in a way that Cre can't excise them.

Wait, the ligand's stop is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor's is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre, which recognizes loxP sites, can cut both. So in theory, both stops should be removed when Cre is active.

But wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP that has a longer sequence. So perhaps the same Cre can recognize both types. So if the Cre can recognize both, then both stops should be excised.

But maybe the lox sites are arranged as loxP followed by lox2272, which might create a different recombination outcome. Or perhaps the vector has the lox sites in a way that isn't compatible with Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps in the vector, the lox sites are in the same orientation, leading to the stops being removed and the tags being expressed.

Wait, if the loxP and lox2272 sites are in a way that the Cre can't act on both, maybe only one stop is removed, but not the other. So the mCherry might be expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But the question is about eGFP, so maybe the eGFP's stop isn't being removed.

But the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Looking at the options again, option D is about the eGFP not being in frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then when the stop is removed, the GFP isn't properly expressed. So the receptor would be expressed, but the GFP isn't, so no fluorescence.

But then, the Western blot would detect the receptor, but not the GFP. But the blot was done on transfected cells, which didn't have Cre, so the GFP wasn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that in the mouse, where Cre is active, the GFP is expressed, but the Western wouldn't have shown it.

Wait, but the question says that after transfection, the Western blot showed a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins (ligand and receptor) are expressed, but the GFP isn't, so the blot doesn't show GFP. But in the mouse, when Cre is active, the GFP should be expressed, leading to a green signal.

But in the mouse, no green. So perhaps the GFP isn't expressed.

Another thought: perhaps the vector is designed such that only the ligand is expressed, and the receptor isn't. But the vector is bicistronic, so both should be expressed.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA promoter, followed by a stop, then IRES, then the receptor. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed after the ligand is translated.

Wait, but when Cre is present, the mCherry and eGFP would be expressed along with the ligand and receptor. So the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

So in the mouse, in cells where Cre is active, you should see both mCherry and eGFP. But the question says they're not seeing eGFP.

Wait, but the question says they only see mCherry or eGFP. Or perhaps the setup is that they're looking for eGFP expression, not mCherry.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So in the presence of Cre, ligand and mCherry are expressed, and receptor and eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse, when they look under the confocal, they're not seeing a green signal (eGFP). So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

So why is eGFP not being expressed? If the stop cassette isn't being removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because Cre isn't active in those cells.

But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So if the confocal is imaging those cells, they should have Cre active.

Alternatively, maybe the vector is misdesigned so that the eGFP isn't expressed. For example, the frame might be incorrect.

Wait, the eGFP is after the receptor ORF, with a stop cassette. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor and eGFP are codirectional, so the eGFP should be expressed as a fusion or just as a tag after the receptor.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated correctly. So no eGFP, hence no green signal.

So that would point to option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

But wait, the Western blot was done on transfected cells without Cre, so the eGFP wasn't expressed, so the blot wouldn't show eGFP. But in the mouse, with Cre, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. So why would there be no eGFP in the mouse?

But the question states that the offspring have the construct, and they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, Cre is expressed, so the stops should be cut. If the eGFP is in frame, then it's expressed; if not, it isn't.

So if the eGFP isn't in frame, then in the mouse, the eGFP won't be expressed, so no green signal. That would explain the result.

Alternatively, the issue could be that the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES element isn't allowing its expression. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, which suggests that both the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, maybe the IRES is driving the receptor's expression, but the eGFP is under a separate promoter? No, the eGFP is downstream of the receptor, so it's part of the same ORF. Wait, no, the eGFP is after the receptor, but separated by the stop cassette, which is removed by Cre. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF.

So perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, it's expressed as a fusion protein. But if the frames don't match, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be option D.

Another angle: the Western blot shows the presence of the proteins, which implies that the ligand and receptor are being expressed correctly. But the eGFP isn't expressed, so the frame must be wrong. So the answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) downstream of stop cassettes that are removed by Cre-mediated recombination. The experiment involves transfecting the vector into primary astrocytes and testing expression via Western blot, followed by breeding mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice to visualize eGFP expression under confocal microscopy. Despite these efforts, no green signal (eGFP) is observed.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies the ligand and receptor act on different cells, but the vector design ensures both are co-expressed in the same cells where Cre is active. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP might not fluoresce, but the Western blot would still detect the receptor. Since the blot shows signals proportional to actin, this suggests the proteins are being expressed, making this option unlikely.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, which should allow expression. The Western blot confirms that the ligand and receptor are expressed, ruling out a missing enhancer as the cause.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The eGFP is located downstream of the receptor, separated by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. If the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor after the stop cassette is removed, it would not be properly translated, leading to no eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation of no green signal under confocal microscopy.  

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, preventing its expression and resulting in no green signal under confocal microscopy.
