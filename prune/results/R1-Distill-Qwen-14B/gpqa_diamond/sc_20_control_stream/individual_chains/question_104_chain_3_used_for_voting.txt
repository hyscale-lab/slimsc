Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. So, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic because the star moves back and forth as the planet orbits. The size of the shift is given for both planets: Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 has a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but how does this shift relate to the planet's orbital period? I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity the star moves at, which is what causes the spectral line shift. K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) ) * some factors... Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ), but wait, since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the denominator simplifies. Also, sin i is approx 1 because the orbits are probably edge-on, but maybe that's not given. Wait, the problem states that both have circular orbits—does that matter for K? Probably not, since K relates to the velocity, which depends on the orbital speed, which for a circular orbit is (2π a)/P, where a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how K relates to the orbital period P. From what I remember, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because the formula includes a term like (P)^{-1/3}.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, then if K1 is for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{1/3}.

Wait, let's think again. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(something) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)) )? Hmm, maybe I should look it up.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude formula is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (c * (2π/P)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me try to find a simpler approach.

I think the key relation is that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ), assuming P is the orbital period. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ). Since M_p is the same for both planets (both similar to Neptune), and M_star is the same (both similar to Sun), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1/P^{1/3} => P ∝ (1/K)^3.

Wait, so if K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{1/3}.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me get that correct.

Because K is proportional to (1/P^{1/3}), so K1 = C / P1^{1/3}, K2 = C / P2^{1/3}, where C is a constant (since M_p and M_star are same for both).

So K1/K2 = (P2^{1/3} ) / (P1^{1/3} )

Which can be rewritten as (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

But wait, in the question, the shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. The shift in the spectrum is a measure of the velocity K. Because the velocity is what causes the Doppler shift—so the higher the K, the larger the shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. Or wait, wait, no—the question says that planet 1's spectral line shifts by up to 5 milliangstrom, and planet 2's by 7. So K is the velocity causing that shift. So K1 =5, K2=7? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the shift magnitude is directly proportional to the velocity. So if a spectral line shifts more, that's a higher velocity (K) for the star.

Wait, but wait. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. So the amplitude K is the maximum velocity. So the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to K. Because the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c (for small v, which is the case here). So, the shift (in angstroms) is proportional to K.

So, if planet #1's spectral line shifts by 5 milliangstroms and planet #2's by 7, then K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2 is larger than K1. But how does K relate to the planet's orbital period?

Earlier, I thought that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K is proportional to 1/P^{1/3}.

So K1 = C / P1^{1/3} → P1 = (C/K1)^3.

Similarly, P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So the ratio of the periods is P2 / P1 = (C/K2)^3 / (C/K1)^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure.

From K = C / P^{1/3} → P = (C / K)^3.

So P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes, then:

P1 ∝ 1/K1^3,

P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

If K1 is smaller than K2, that means that planet 1 has a smaller semi-amplitude. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a smaller K means a larger P. So planet 1 would have a longer period than planet 2 if K1 is smaller than K2. Wait, but in our problem, planet 1 has a smaller K (5 ma) than planet 2 (7 ma). So P1 would be larger than P2. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. So when the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1, the answer must be less than 1.

Wait, but the question is asking: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter than P1, then the factor would be less than 1.

So let's get back to the equation: P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Yes, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So substituting the values, K1 =5, K2=7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Which is approximately 0.36. So option A is ~0.36. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, which makes sense because a larger K implies a shorter period (since K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}).

So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So 0.36 times longer. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but wait another moment—let me double-check.

If K1 = 5, K2 =7, then:

P1 ∝ (1/K1)^3 = (1/5)^3 = 1/125,

P2 ∝ (1/7)^3 ≈ 1/343.

So P2/P1 = (1/343)/(1/125) )= 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, that's correct. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so it is not longer. But wait, the question is the other way around: how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the ratio is P2 / P1 = 0.364. So it's ~0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is about 36% as long as that of planet #1. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). Rearranging, \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- Planet #1 has a spectral line shift corresponding to \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \),
- Planet #2 has a spectral line shift corresponding to \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \),

we calculate the ratio of the periods as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \left(0.7143\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. However, the question asks how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1, so the answer is approximately 0.36.
