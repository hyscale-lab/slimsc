Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says we have an atom with a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Wait, but I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So, the decay probability isn't linear. 

The problem states that 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read that again. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the total time since the start is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150. So, the total time being considered is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or is it? Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, the atom is being monitored right away. So, the initial time is t=0, and 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, we want the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which would take the total time up to 200 minutes.

But wait, the given 32% is within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability is 0.32 at t=100. But I think radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next interval doesn't depend on how long it's been since the start. So, if 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the remaining probability isn't just 32% minus something. Instead, we need to calculate the probability based on the remaining time.

Wait, let me think in terms of the decay constant. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but I can also relate it to the probability. The formula for the probability P that a nucleus decays by time t is P = 1 - e^(-λ t). Alternatively, the survival probability is S(t) = e^(-λ t).

So, given that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So, 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100). Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ * 100. So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. 

Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but more accurately, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So, λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate ln(0.68). Let me think: ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108. So 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.6. Let me use a calculator approach. Hmm, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since this is a thought process, I'll proceed with approximate numbers.

So, λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, since 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, the survival probability after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-λ *50). Let me compute that. λ*50 is 0.0038566 *50 ≈ 0.19283. So e^(-0.19283) ≈ approximately 0.8245, because e^-0.2 is about 0.8187. So, approximately 0.8245, which is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes.

Now, we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, starting from 50 minutes. So, the time from now is 150 minutes. The total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

The survival probability after another 150 minutes is S(150) = e^(-λ *150). So, the probability of decay in that period is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, actually, the decay probability from time t=50 to t=200 is the probability that it decays in that interval. Since the process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from t=0, but given that it hasn't decayed until t=50. Hmm, wait, no, in reality, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. But since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when you start.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150). Let's calculate that.

First, compute λ=0.0038566 per minute.

λ*150 = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate. Let's say 0.57849 is 0.578. Let me compute ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, which is close to our 0.578. Wait, no, wait: e^-0.578 is ≈ 0.561?

Wait, perhaps using the calculator approach. Let me think of Taylor expansion for e^-x around x=0.5. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to compute 0.57849. Let me think: e^-0.57 is approximately e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07). e^0.07 is about 1.0725, so e^-0.07 ≈ 0.9316. e^-0.5 is 0.6065. Multiply 0.6065 *0.9316 ≈ 0.6065 *0.93 ≈ 0.564. So, e^-0.578 is about 0.561? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact calculation.

But maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using the given information to find lambda and then compute the required probability.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. The decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay constant λ can be found from that. Once I have λ, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from the current point) is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But wait, no, because from the start, 50 minutes have passed. So, the time left is 150 minutes. But the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval from the present, regardless of the previous time.

So, let me compute λ again. From the initial data: the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Which gives λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.470588)/100. Let me compute ln(1.470588). Well, ln(1.4) is about 0.3365, ln(1.5)=0.4055. 1.470588 is about 1.47, so ln(1.47)≈0.3856. So, λ ≈0.3856/100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the time interval we're interested in is 150 minutes. So, the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ*150: 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

So e^-0.5784 is approximately. Let's compute that. Let me think: e^0.5 is about 1.6487, so e^0.5784 would be higher. Wait, wait, we need e^-0.5784 which is 1/(e^0.5784).

What's e^0.5784? Let me approximate it. Let me think of known exponents:

e^0.5 = 1.64872

e^0.6 ≈ 1.822118800

So, 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's find the value between them.

Let me try to compute e^0.5784.

Another approach: using a Taylor series expansion around x=0.5.

e^x = e^0.5 * e^{x-0.5}.

x=0.5784, so x-0.5=0.0784.

e^0.0784 ≈ 1 + 0.0784 + (0.0784^2)/2 + (0.0784^3)/6.

Compute each term:

0.0784 ≈ 0.0784.

(0.0784)^2 ≈ 0.00614656. Divided by 2: ~0.003073.

(0.0784)^3 ≈ 0.00048189. Divided by 6: ~0.0000803.

Adding up: 0.0784 + 0.003073=0.081473 +0.0000803=0.081553.

So, e^0.0784 ≈ 1.081553.

So, e^0.5784 ≈ e^0.5 * 1.081553.

e^0.5 ~1.64872, so 1.64872 * 1.081553.

Let me compute that:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

1.64872 * 0.001553 ≈ approx 0.002555.

Adding them together: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.002555 ≈ 1.78317.

So, e^0.5784 ≈ 1.78317.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 1/1.78317 ≈ 0.5606.

So, 1 - 0.5606 = 0.4394, approximately 43.94%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which matches this.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the initial 100 minutes was the half-life period (or something similar), but since 50 minutes have passed, is the remaining time 150 minutes considered from the starting point, or from the 50-minute mark? Oh, no, the question states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the next 150 minutes are from that point. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. But in radioactive decay, the probability after time t is independent of when you start. So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of the previous time.

Wait, but another way to think about it is the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200. That's the same as the survival probability at 50 minutes multiplied by the decay probability in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, because the decay probability between 50 and 200 is the probability that it decays at some point between 50 and 200.

In that case, the probability is S(50) * (1 - S(50+150)).

Because S(50) is the survival probability up to 50 minutes, and then the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is S(50) multiplied by (1 - S(200)).

So, let me compute S(50) and S(200).

S(50) = e^(-λ *50).

We have λ=0.003856 per minute.

λ*50 = 0.003856 *50 = 0.1928.

e^-0.1928 ≈ let's compute that. e^-0.2 is 0.8187, but 0.1928 is a bit less than 0.2. So, e^-0.1928 is a bit higher than 0.8243 (since e^-0.1928 = approx 0.825? Let me compute. Again, using the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that e^0.1928 is approximately 1.213. So e^-0.1928 ≈ 1/1.213 ≈ 0.8246.

Then, S(50) ≈ 0.8246.

S(200) = e^(-λ*200) = e^(-0.003856*200) = e^(-0.7712).

What is e^-0.7712?

e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.7712 is a bit lower. Let me compute. Compute e^-0.7712:

We know e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.77 is approximately 0.459? Let me think: ln(0.459)≈-0.77. So, S(200) ≈ 0.459.

So, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is S(50)*(1 - S(200)).

Which is 0.8246 * (1 - 0.459) = 0.8246 * 0.541 ≈ let me compute that.

0.8246 * 0.5 = 0.4123.

0.8246 * 0.041 ≈ approx 0.0337.

Adding them: 0.4123 + 0.0337 ≈ 0.446. So, about 44.6%, which is approximately 44%, matching option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous approach. Let me think again: the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased, the 32% is within 100 minutes. So, the decay constant was determined based on a 100-minute half-life scenario. So, perhaps using the half-life formula would be better.

Wait, the decay probability of 32% in 100 minutes. So, the survival probability S(100) is 68%, as I computed earlier. So, the half-life T_1/2 is the time when S(t)=0.5.

The formula for S(t) is S(t)= (T_1/2 / t) )^ (ln(2)/ln(0.5))? Wait, no. The decay formula is S(t) = (1/2)^(t / T_1/2). So, because S(t) = e^(-λ t) and λ = ln(2)/T_1/2.

So, from S(100)=0.68, we can find T_1/2.

0.68 = (1/2)^(100 / T_1/2).

Take natural log on both sides: ln(0.68) = (100 / T_1/2) * ln(0.5).

We can solve for T_1/2.

ln(0.68) = approx -0.38566.

ln(0.5) is approx -0.6931.

So, -0.38566 = (100 / T_1/2) * (-0.6931).

Divide both sides by -0.6931:

0.38566 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.556 ≈ (100 / T_1/2).

So, 100 / T_1/2 ≈ 0.556 → T_1/2 ≈ 100 / 0.556 ≈ 179.6 minutes.

So, the half-life is approximately 180 minutes.

Now, the time that has passed is 50 minutes, and the remaining time is 150. So, the total time since the start is 200 minutes.

The survival probability after 200 minutes is S(200) = (1/2)^(200 / 180) = (1/2)^(10/9) ≈ (0.5)^(1.1111).

Wait, 200/180 is 10/9 ≈ 1.1111.

So, 0.5^1.1111 is approximately the same as 1/(2^1.1111). 2^1=2, 2^0.1111≈1.0801. So 2^1.1111 ≈ 2 * 1.0801 ≈ 2.1602. So, 1/2.1602≈0.46296.

So, the survival probability after 200 minutes is ≈46.3%.

But since 50 minutes have already passed, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is S(50) * (1 - S(200)).

Wait, no. Alternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is S(50) = (1/2)^(50/180) = (1/2)^(5/18) ≈ 0.7579.

Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from 50 to 200) is S(50) * (1 - S(200)).

So, S(50) = (1/2)^(50/180) = (1/2)^(5/18) ≈ approx. Let's compute that.

5/18 ≈ 0.27778.

So, (1/2)^0.27778 = e^( (ln(0.5)) * 0.27778 ) = e^(-0.6931 * 0.27778) = e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.8247.

Then, S(50)=0.8247.

S(200) as before is approx 0.463.

So, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is 0.8247*(1-0.463) = 0.8247 * 0.537 ≈ let's compute that.

0.8 *0.537 = 0.4296.

0.0247 *0.537 ≈ approx 0.01326.

Total≈0.44286, so about 44.3%, which is approximately 44% → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, let's compute S(50) and S(200) correctly.

S(50) = e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.003856*50) = e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.825.

S(200) = e^(-0.003856*200) = e^(-0.7712) ≈ around 0.4615.

So, the decay probability between 50 and 200 is  S(50) * (1 - S(200)).

Which is 0.825 * (1 - 0.4615) = 0.825 * 0.5385.

Compute that: 0.8 *0.5385=0.4308, 0.025 *0.5385=0.01346. Total is 0.44426, so 44.43%. Close to 44%.

So, the correct answer should be option A) 44%.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The decay probability of an atom within a given time can be expressed as:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The survival probability (probability of not decaying) is:

\[
S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). The survival probability at \( t = 100 \) is:

\[
S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Using \( S(100) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} \), we solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
\ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Survival probability after 50 minutes
Since 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed, the survival probability at \( t = 50 \) is:

\[
S(50) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 50} = e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 50} = e^{-0.19283}
\]

Approximating \( e^{-0.19283} \approx 0.8245 \), we find:

\[
S(50) \approx 0.8245
\]

### Step 3: Decay probability in the next 150 minutes
We need the probability of decay between \( t = 50 \) and \( t = 200 \) (50 + 150 minutes). The survival probability at \( t = 200 \) is:

\[
S(200) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 200} = e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 200} = e^{-0.77132}
\]

Approximating \( e^{-0.77132} \approx 0.4615 \), we find:

\[
S(200) \approx 0.4615
\]

The probability of decay between \( t = 50 \) and \( t = 200 \) is:

\[
P(50 \to 200) = S(50) \cdot (1 - S(200))
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(50 \to 200) = 0.8245 \cdot (1 - 0.4615) = 0.8245 \cdot 0.5385 \approx 0.4428
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**A) 44%**

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says we have an atom with a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Wait, but I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So, the decay probability isn't linear. 

The problem states that 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read that again. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the total time since the start is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150. So, the total time being considered is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or is it? Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, the atom is being monitored right away. So, the initial time is t=0, and 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, we want the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which would take the total time up to 200 minutes.

But wait, the given 32% is within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability is 0.32 at t=100. But I think radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next interval doesn't depend on how long it's been since the start. So, if 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the remaining probability isn't just 32% minus something. Instead, we need to calculate the probability based on the remaining time.

Wait, let me think in terms of the decay constant. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but I can also relate it to the probability. The formula for the probability P that a nucleus decays by time t is P = 1 - e^(-λ t). Alternatively, the survival probability is S(t) = e^(-λ t).

So, given that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So, 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100). Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ * 100. So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. 

Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but more accurately, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So, λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate ln(0.68). Let me think: ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108. So 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.6. Let me use a calculator approach. Hmm, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since this is a thought process, I'll proceed with approximate numbers.

Now, since 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, the survival probability after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-λ *50). Let me compute that. λ*50 is 0.0038566 *50 ≈ 0.19283. So e^(-0.19283) ≈ approximately 0.8245, because e^-0.2 is about 0.8187. So, approximately 0.8245, which is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes.

Now, we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, starting from 50 minutes. So, the time from now is 150 minutes. The total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

The survival probability after another 150 minutes is S(150) = e^(-λ *150). So, the probability of decay in that period is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, actually, the decay probability from time t=50 to t=200 is the probability that it decays in that interval. Since the process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from t=0, but given that it hasn't decayed until t=50. Hmm, wait, no, in reality, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. But since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when you start.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150). Let's calculate that.

First, compute λ=0.0038566 per minute.

λ*150 = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate. Let's say 0.57849 is 0.578. Let me compute ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, which is close to our 0.578. Wait, no, wait: e^-0.578 is ≈ 0.561?

Wait, perhaps using the calculator approach. Let me think of Taylor expansion for e^-x around x=0.5. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to compute 0.57849. Let me think: e^-0.57 is approximately e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07). e^0.07 is about 1.0725, so e^-0.07 ≈ 0.9316. e^-0.5 is 0.6065. Multiply 0.6065 *0.9316 ≈ 0.6065 *0.93 ≈ 0.564. So, e^-0.578 is about 0.561? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact calculation.

But maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using the given information to find lambda and then compute the required probability.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. The decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay constant λ can be found from that. Once I have λ, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from the current point) is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But wait, no, because from the start, 50 minutes have passed. So, the time left is 150 minutes. But the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval from the present, regardless of the previous time.

So, let me compute λ again. From the initial data: the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Which gives λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.470588)/100. Let me compute ln(1.470588). Well, ln(1.4) is about 0.3365, ln(1.5)=0.4055. 1.470588 is about 1.47, so ln(1.47)≈0.3856. So, λ ≈0.3856/100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the time interval we're interested in is 150 minutes. So, the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ*150: 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

So e^-0.5784 is approximately. Let's compute that. Let me think: e^0.5 is about 1.6487, so e^0.5784 would be higher. Wait, wait, we need e^-0.5784 which is 1/(e^0.5784).

What's e^0.5784? Let me approximate it. Let me think of known exponents:

e^0.5 = 1.64872

e^0.6 ≈ 1.822118800

So, 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's find the value between them.

Let me try to compute e^0.5784.

Another approach: using a Taylor series expansion around x=0.5.

e^x = e^0.5 * e^{x-0.5}.

x=0.5784, so x-0.5=0.0784.

e^0.0784 ≈ 1 + 0.0784 + (0.0784^2)/2 + (0.0784^3)/6.

Compute each term:

0.0784 ≈ 0.0784.

(0.0784)^2 ≈ 0.00614656. Divided by 2: ~0.003073.

(0.0784)^3 ≈ 0.00048189. Divided by 6: ~0.0000803.

Adding up: 0.0784 + 0.003073=0.081473 +0.0000803=0.081553.

So, e^0.0784 ≈ 1.081553.

So, e^0.5784 ≈ e^0.5 * 1.081553.

e^0.5 ~1.64872, so 1.64872 * 1.081553.

Let me compute that:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

1.64872 * 0.001553 ≈ approx 0.002555.

Adding them together: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.002555 ≈ 1.78317.

So, e^0.5784 ≈ 1.78317.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 1/1.78317 ≈ 0.5606.

So, 1 - 0.5606 = 0.4394, approximately 43.94%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which matches this.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the initial 100 minutes was the half-life period (or something similar), but since 50 minutes have passed, is the remaining time 150 minutes considered from the starting point, or from the 50-minute mark? Oh, no, the question states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the next 150 minutes are from that point. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. But in radioactive decay, the probability after time t is independent of when you start. So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of the previous time.

Wait, but another way to think about it is the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200. That's the same as the survival probability at 50 minutes multiplied by the decay probability in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, because the decay probability between 50 and 200 is the probability that it decays at some point between 50 and 200.

In that case, the probability is S(50) * (1 - S(50+150)).

Because S(50) is the survival probability up to 50 minutes, and then the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is S(50) multiplied by (1 - S(200)).

So, let me compute S(50) and S(200).

S(50) = e^(-λ *50).

We have λ=0.003856 per minute.

λ*50 = 0.003856 *50 = 0.1928.

e^-0.1928 ≈ let's compute that. e^-0.2 is 0.8187, but 0.1928 is a bit less than 0.2. So, e^-0.1928 is a bit higher than 0.8243 (since e^-0.1928 = approx 0.825? Let me compute. Again, using the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that e^0.1928 is approximately 1.213. So e^-0.1928 ≈ 1/1.213 ≈ 0.8246.

Then, S(50) ≈ 0.8246.

S(200) = e^(-λ*200) = e^(-0.003856*200) = e^(-0.7712).

What is e^-0.7712?

e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.7712 is a bit lower. Let me compute. Compute e^-0.7712:

We know e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.77 is approximately 0.459? Let me think: ln(0.459)≈-0.77. So, S(200) ≈ 0.459.

So, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is S(50)*(1 - S(200)).

Which is 0.8246 * (1 - 0.459) = 0.8246 * 0.541 ≈ let me compute that.

0.8246 * 0.5 = 0.4123.

0.8246 * 0.041 ≈ approx 0.0337.

Adding them: 0.4123 + 0.0337 ≈ 0.446. So, about 44.6%, which is approximately 44%, matching option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous approach. Let me think again: the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased, the 32% is within 100 minutes. So, the decay constant was determined based on a 100-minute half-life scenario. So, perhaps using the half-life formula would be better.

Wait, the decay probability of 32% in 100 minutes. So, the survival probability S(100) is 68%, as I computed earlier. So, the half-life T_1/2 is the time when S(t)=0.5.

The formula for S(t) is S(t)= (T_1/2 / t) )^ (ln(2)/ln(0.5))? Wait, no. The decay formula is S(t) = (1/2)^(t / T_1/2). So, because S(t) = e^(-λ t) and λ = ln(2)/T_1/2.

So, from S(100)=0.68, we can find T_1/2.

0.68 = (1/2)^(100 / T_1/2).

Take natural log on both sides: ln(0.68) = (100 / T_1/2) * ln(0.5).

We can solve for T_1/2.

ln(0.68) = approx -0.38566.

ln(0.5) is approx -0.6931.

So, -0.38566 = (100 / T_1/2) * (-0.6931).

Divide both sides by -0.6931:

0.38566 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.556 ≈ (100 / T_1/2).

So, 100 / T_1/2 ≈ 0.556 → T_1/2 ≈ 100 / 0.556 ≈ 179.6 minutes.

So, the half-life is approximately 180 minutes.

Now, the time that has passed is 50 minutes, and the remaining time is 150. So, the total time since the start is 200 minutes.

The survival probability after 200 minutes is S(200) = (1/2)^(200 / 180) = (1/2)^(10/9) ≈ (0.5)^(1.1111).

Wait, 200/180 is 10/9 ≈ 1.1111.

So, 0.5^1.1111 is approximately the same as 1/(2^1.1111). 2^1=2, 2^0.1111≈1.0801. So 2^1.1111 ≈ 2 * 1.0801 ≈ 2.1602. So, 1/2.1602≈0.46296.

So, the survival probability after 200 minutes is ≈46.3%.

But since 50 minutes have already passed, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is S(50) * (1 - S(200)).

Wait, no. Alternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is S(50) = (1/2)^(50/180) = (1/2)^(5/18) ≈ 0.7579.

Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from 50 to 200) is S(50) * (1 - S(200)).

So, S(50) = (1/2)^(50/180) = (1/2)^(5/18) ≈ approx. Let's compute that.

5/18 ≈ 0.27778.

So, (1/2)^0.27778 = e^( (ln(0.5)) * 0.27778 ) = e^(-0.6931 * 0.27778) = e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.8247.

Then, S(50)=0.8247.

S(200) as before is approx 0.463.

So, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is 0.8247*(1-0.463) = 0.8247 * 0.537 ≈ let's compute that.

0.8 *0.537 = 0.4296.

0.0247 *0.537 ≈ approx 0.01326.

Total≈0.44286, so about 44.3%, which is approximately 44% → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, let's compute S(50) and S(200) correctly.

S(50) = e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.003856*50) = e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.825.

S(200) = e^(-0.003856*200) = e^(-0.7712) ≈ around 0.4615.

So, the decay probability between 50 and 200 is  S(50) * (1 - S(200)).

Which is 0.825 * (1 - 0.4615) = 0.825 * 0.5385.

Compute that: 0.8 *0.5385=0.4308, 0.025 *0.5385=0.01346. Total is 0.44426, so 44.43%. Close to 44%.

So, the correct answer should be option A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The decay probability of an atom within a given time can be expressed as:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The survival probability (probability of not decaying) is:

\[
S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). The survival probability at \( t = 100 \) is:

\[
S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Using \( S(100) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} \), we solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
\ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Survival probability after 50 minutes
Since 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed, the survival probability at \( t = 50 \) is:

\[
S(50) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 50} = e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 50} = e^{-0.19283}
\]

Approximating \( e^{-0.19283} \approx 0.8245 \), we find:

\[
S(50) \approx 0.8245
\]

### Step 3: Decay probability in the next 150 minutes
We need the probability of decay between \( t = 50 \) and \( t = 200 \) (50 + 150 minutes). The survival probability at \( t = 200 \) is:

\[
S(200) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 200} = e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 200} = e^{-0.77132}
\]

Approximating \( e^{-0.77132} \approx 0.4615 \), we find:

\[
S(200) \approx 0.4615
\]

The probability of decay between \( t = 50 \) and \( t = 200 \) is:

\[
P(50 \to 200) = S(50) \cdot (1 - S(200))
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(50 \to 200) = 0.8245 \cdot (1 - 0.4615) = 0.8245 \cdot 0.5385 \approx 0.4428
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**A) 44%**
