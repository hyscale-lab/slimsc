Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The reaction is p + pbar → 2A+ + 2A-. So a proton and antiproton annihilate into two particles each, A+ and A-. Interesting.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh wait, so the antiproton isn't at rest, but it's moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate its velocity as non-relativistic? Or perhaps not, but I'm not sure yet.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I remember that when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into the energy of the products. But since the products are two pairs of particles, we need to consider conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So the initial energy is the sum of their rest masses plus their kinetic energies. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton's kinetic energy is negligible, or maybe both are at rest? Wait, no, the antiproton is moving, but the proton is presumably at rest in the lab frame? Or maybe they're moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta? Hmm, the question isn't entirely clear on the setup. Oh wait, the antiproton is "slowly moving," so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some low velocity. That would make sense for the lab frame.

So if the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_pbar, which is small, then the total initial energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass, so maybe we can approximate it as E_initial ≈ (m_p + m_pbar) c², since their rest masses are about the same (proton and antiproton have same mass). But wait, m_p c² is about 938 MeV, right? So 300 MeV is much less, so each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c². So four A particles would be 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV/c². But wait, initial rest mass would be 2 * m_p c², since p and pbar each have mass m_p. So 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So the initial energy is about 1876 MeV, and the products have a combined rest mass of 1200 MeV. So the annihilation produces a lot of energy, which goes into kinetic energy of the products.

But wait, how about the conservation of momentum? Since the initial system has the antiproton moving, and the proton at rest, the total initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. So the products must carry off the same total momentum.

But in this case, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as 2A+ + 2A−. So perhaps the products are two particles each of A+ and A−? Or maybe it's two A+ and two A−, making four in total. Hmm, but that's a lot of particles, but maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be two A particles in total. Or perhaps each A is either + or −, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps they're considering charge but not mass. Wait, the mass is given as mA c²=300 MeV, so each A has mass 300 MeV/c². So four particles in total, each 300 MeV/c², so total rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV/c².

Wait, but the initial system's rest mass is the sum of the proton and antiproton, which is about 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV/c². So, the initial rest energy is higher than the rest energy of the products. So, some of the initial rest mass goes into kinetic energy of the products.

But the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. So the velocity of each A? Or the velocity in the center-of-momentum frame? Hmm, but wait, the initial momentum is non-zero because the antiproton is moving. So the products can't all be at rest in the lab frame.

Wait, but perhaps since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can make some approximations. Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial momentum as p_initial. Since the proton is at rest (in the lab frame), and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, its momentum is gamma m_p v, where gamma is approximately 1 because v is small. So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

After the annihilation, the products must carry the same total momentum. Let's assume that all four A particles are emitted in the same direction as the initial momentum, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are moving in a symmetric way.

Wait, but maybe the problem is symmetric, with the two A+ and two A− moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Alternatively, maybe each pair has opposite momenta. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in opposite directions, but in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial.

Wait, this might get complicated with four particles. Maybe the problem simplifies because the products are moving in pairs. Let me think: perhaps two A+ and two A− are produced, each with some velocity. But without more information, maybe we can consider that the products are moving with some velocity u, but that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that each A is moving with the same velocity, which would be a simplification. But I’m not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the center-of-momentum frame. No, because the initial total momentum isn't zero. The antiproton is moving, so the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. So the products must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum, which is m_p v.

But perhaps we can use the conservation laws in the center-of-momentum frame first, but I think that would complicate things more.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the products move with the same velocity, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the case where the products are moving with the same velocity. Let's assume that, even though it's an approximation, it might work for this problem.

So, the total energy of the products would be the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. But since the initial energy is higher, the products must have kinetic energy.

But let me write down the equations.

Let me denote:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + (gamma m_p c²) → but wait, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its energy is gamma m_p c². So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, each A has energy E_A, and momentum p_A. Since there are four A particles, but their directions could be such that the total momentum is conserved. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in pairs, so that the total momentum is 2 p_A each in opposite directions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each pair (A+ and A−) are moving in opposite directions, but maybe each pair has the same magnitude of momentum. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, which would be the case if the process is symmetric. But that might not be correct, as the products could be emitted in any direction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, so that for each A+ and A−, they have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions, but that would sum to zero. So that can't be, because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Wait, but if the products are two A+ and two A−, perhaps each A+ is moving in one direction and each A− is moving in the opposite. But then the total momentum would be zero, which can't be because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering that the products are two A particles each, but that's unclear. Wait, the reaction is p + pbar → 2A+ + 2A−. So four particles in total. So maybe two A+ and two A− are produced, but perhaps each pair has a combined momentum that contributes to the total.

Wait, perhaps each A+ and A− have the same speed but opposite directions, but that would make their momenta cancel. But since there are two each, that would complicate things. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the products are each moving with the same speed, but arranged symmetrically. Maybe all four are moving in the same direction? That doesn't make sense because the initial momentum is in one direction, and the products would have to balance that. Alternatively, perhaps some are moving in the same direction, and others in the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated in the center of mass frame, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all four particles are moving with the same speed, but in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

Wait, given that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can use non-relativistic approximation for the initial momentum.

So for the initial momentum, p_initial ≈ m_p v. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so p_initial is small compared to m_p c.

Hmm, but in reality, even a small velocity can lead to relativistic effects. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," implying v << c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Maybe we can approximate gamma as 1 for the initial energy.

So E_initial ≈ (m_p + m_p) c² = 2 m_p c².

The rest mass energy of the products is 4 * m_A c². So if m_A is 300 MeV/c², then 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

Wait, the initial rest energy is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So if the products' rest mass is 1200, then the available energy is 1876 MeV, which would be more than enough to create the products, with some kinetic energy left over.

But how to find the velocity of each A. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can use the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v). Let me set up the equations.

Let me denote:

Initial momentum: p_initial = m_p v (since gamma ≈1, and v is small).

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + (m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² ) → Wait, no. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c². But gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but since v is small, maybe we can approximate the initial energy as:

E_initial ≈ m_p c² (1 + 1 + (v²)/(2 c²)) ) → E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2 c²).

But for small v, the (v²) term is negligible compared to the rest mass terms, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But the products have rest mass energy 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So the remaining energy goes into kinetic energy of the products.

But perhaps in the limit where the initial momentum is small, the products move with some velocity u, and their kinetic energy is (1/2) m_A u² each. But wait, that's a non-relativistic approach, and maybe not accurate, but perhaps the problem expects that.

But if the products are moving with velocity u, then their momentum is m_A u each. But how many of them are moving in each direction?

Wait, if we have four particles, perhaps two are moving in the direction of the initial momentum, and two in the opposite. But that might not balance the momentum.

Wait, let me try considering that each A has velocity u in the same direction. Then the total momentum of the products would be 4 m_A u. But the initial momentum is m_p v. So 4 m_A u = m_p v.

But I don't know v, so perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the products are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to m_p v. Let's say, for example, that two A+ are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, and two A− are moving opposite, but that would complicate things because their momenta would subtract.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote:

Let u be the velocity of each A particle in the lab frame.

Assuming all A particles have the same speed u, but moving in different directions. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps they are all moving in the same direction as the initial momentum. Then the total momentum of the products would be 4 m_A u.

But the initial momentum is m_p v. So 4 m_A u = m_p v.

But I don't know v yet.

Energy conservation: E_initial = sum of energies of products.

E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

Sum of energies of products: 4 gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for the A particles.

So, 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Simplify: gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p) / (2 m_A).

Given that m_p c² is about 938 MeV, and m_A c² is 300 MeV, so m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = 938 / (2*300) ) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

Now, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c² ) = 1.563.

So, 1 - u²/c² = 1/(gamma^2) ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.4096.

So, u²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

So u = c * sqrt(0.5904) ≈ c * 0.768 ≈ 0.768 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. Close enough, so the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Is this correct?

In this approach, I assumed that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, which is the same direction as the antiproton's motion. But that's a big assumption because, in reality, the products could be emitted in any direction. But since the problem gives a single velocity for each A, perhaps this is the intended approach.

But wait, in reality, the products would likely distribute their momenta in various directions to conserve both energy and momentum. However, perhaps in this approximation, all the A's are moving in the same direction, making the calculation manageable.

So, the velocity u we found is approximately 0.768c, which is option A, 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation was wrong. Because the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial velocity v is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, but since the initial momentum is non-zero, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is in the rest frame of the proton, where the antiproton is moving slowly. So, the initial momentum is low. Then, perhaps the products are moving at a high speed, but in such a way that their momentum sums to the initial.

Wait, but regardless of that, the calculation I did earlier gives a velocity around 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but let me verify the numbers again. m_p is about 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = m_p / (2 m_A) = 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

So, 1/gamma_A^2 ≈ 1/(2.442) ≈ 0.409.

So, 1 - u²/c² = 0.409 → u²/c² = 0.591 → u ≈ 0.769c.

Which rounds to 0.77c, option A.

But wait, the options include 0.96c, which is much higher. Hmm. So did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the products are moving in the opposite direction? Or perhaps I should consider relativistic momentum.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I used the non-relativistic approximation for the initial momentum but considered the products' energies to be relativistic. That might be inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat everything relativistically.

Wait, let's do that properly.

Let me denote:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, the products' total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

The products' total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A u, where u is the velocity (assuming all A's move in the same direction as the initial momentum).

So, setting up the conservation equations:

1. Energy: E_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

2. Momentum: p_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But we can express gamma_A in terms of u:

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

But we have two equations:

Equation 1: m_p c² (1 + gamma ) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Equation 2: gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But this seems complicated because we have variables gamma, v, u, and gamma_A.

Wait, but perhaps because the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), which is approximately 1. So, perhaps we can approximate gamma as 1, but that might not be accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate v and u via the two equations.

But this could get complicated. Alternatively, let's express u in terms of v.

From equation 2: u = (gamma m_p v) / (4 gamma_A m_A )

But equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma) c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, 1 + gamma = (4 gamma_A m_A )/(m_p )

Substituting into equation for u:

u = (gamma m_p v) / (4 gamma_A m_A ) 

= (gamma m_p v) * (1 + gamma)/(4 m_A ) 

Wait, because from equation 1, 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

So, substituting back:

u = (gamma m_p v) * (1 + gamma) / (4 m_A )

But 4 m_A = ( m_p (1 + gamma) ) / gamma_A )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here and need to find a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame, and express everything in terms of beta and gamma.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe the correct approach is to use the invariant quantity, the Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame.

s = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

s is invariant and equals (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

In the lab frame:

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [ (m_p + gamma m_p ) c² ]^2 - [ (gamma m_p v ) c ]^2.

= m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma )² - gamma² m_p² v^2 c².

= m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 (v²/c²) ].

But this might not be the easiest way to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant s is equal to the square of the total rest mass of the products.

Wait, the products are 4 A particles, so the total rest mass is 4 m_A c².

So, s = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Thus:

(m_p + gamma m_p )^2 c^4 - (gamma m_p v )^2 c² = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4:

(m_p (1 + gamma ) )^2 - (gamma m_p v )^2 / c² = (4 m_A )^2.

Let me factor m_p²:

m_p² [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² (v² / c² ) ] = (4 m_A )^2.

Hmm, but I don't know v. So perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, but maybe because the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c, so we can approximate gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the initial approach was correct, and the answer is 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, 0.77c is option A. But the given options also include 0.96c, which is option B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all four A particles are moving in the same direction. If instead, the products have a higher velocity, perhaps due to more energy, then the velocity could be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the velocity in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: since the initial system's center of mass energy is sqrt(s), which is 4 m_A c², as per the invariant, but perhaps not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck and need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated in the center-of-momentum frame. So, in that frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the products would have to have zero total momentum as well. That would mean that the products come out symmetrically, perhaps in pairs.

Wait, but that's only possible if the total momentum is zero. So, perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, the products move symmetrically, but then you have to transform back to the lab frame.

Hmm, perhaps that's the right approach. Let me try that.

So, first, find the velocity of the center-of-momentum (COM) frame relative to the lab frame.

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, the antiproton has velocity v. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small).

The total energy is E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² (since gamma ≈ 1).

The velocity of the COM frame, beta_com, is given by (total momentum c)/(total energy).

So beta_com = (p_initial c) / E_initial = (m_p v c) / (2 m_p c² ) )= v/(2 c).

So the COM frame is moving with velocity beta_com = v/(2 c) in the lab frame.

Now, in the COM frame, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies plus their kinetic energies, but in this frame, the total momentum is zero.

So, in the COM frame, the products must have zero total momentum. So perhaps each pair of A's moves in opposite directions, but their momenta cancel each other.

But each A has mass m_A, so in the COM frame, each A would have some velocity, but their momenta would cancel.

Now, the energy in the COM frame is sqrt(s) = 4 m_A c².

So, the total energy in the COM frame is 4 m_A c².

Now, each A has energy E_A' = gamma_A' m_A c².

So, 4 E_A' = 4 gamma_A' m_A c² = 4 m_A c² → gamma_A' = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 4 gamma_A' m_A c² = 4 m_A c² → gamma_A' = 1 → which implies that the particles are at rest. But that's only possible if they have zero momentum, but that can't be since the initial momentum in the lab frame was non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. In the COM frame, the initial energy is sqrt(s) = 4 m_A c², which equals the sum of the energies of the products. Each product would then have energy E_A' = m_A c², so gamma_A' =1. That would mean each A is at rest in the COM frame. But that's impossible because their momenta must cancel.

Wait, but if each A is at rest, their momenta are zero, which satisfies the COM condition. But then their velocities are zero in the COM frame. So, how does that translate back into the lab frame?

Wait, the COM frame is moving at velocity beta_com = v/(2 c) relative to the lab. So, the velocity of each A in the lab frame would be the velocity of the COM frame plus the velocity of the A in the COM frame. But in the COM frame, the A's are at rest, so their velocity in the lab frame is beta_com c.

So, u = beta_com c = (v/(2 c)) c = v/2.

But in the lab frame, the initial momentum is m_p v.

Wait, but in the COM frame, each A is at rest. So, in the lab frame, each A is moving with velocity v/2.

So, their momentum in the lab frame would be gamma(u) m_A u.

But wait, let's calculate their momentum.

The velocity u = v/2.

But gamma(u) = 1/sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)).

So, the momentum of each A in the lab frame is gamma(u) m_A u.

But since there are four A's, each moving in the same direction (since in COM they're at rest, but in lab they're moving with v/2), the total momentum is 4 gamma(u) m_A u.

But the initial momentum was m_p v.

So,

4 gamma(u) m_A u = m_p v.

But u = v/2, so substituting:

4 gamma(v/2) m_A (v/2) = m_p v.

Dividing both sides by v:

4 gamma(v/2) m_A (1/2) = m_p.

So,

gamma(v/2) m_A = m_p.

gamma(v/2) = m_p / m_A.

m_p is about 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c². So,

gamma(v/2) = 938 / 300 ≈ 3.1267.

gamma(v/2) = 3.1267.

gamma(v/2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/4 c² )) ≈ 3.1267.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/(4 c² )) ) ≈ 3.1267.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/(4 c² )) ≈ 1/3.1267 ≈ 0.3198.

Square both sides:

1 - v²/(4 c² ) ≈ 0.1023.

So,

v²/(4 c² ) ≈ 1 - 0.1023 ≈ 0.8977.

v² ≈ 4 * 0.8977 c² → v ≈ sqrt(3.5908) c ≈ 1.895 c.

But that's impossible because v cannot exceed c. So, this suggests that our assumption is wrong. Hence, this approach might not be correct.

Hmm, seems like I'm hitting a dead end. Maybe time to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is the first one, where each A has gamma ≈ 1.563, leading to velocity ≈0.768c, which is approximately 0.77c, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: if the initial momentum is small, perhaps the products are moving with a velocity close to the speed of light. Because when the initial energy is much larger than the rest mass of the products, the particles would move relativistically.

Wait, in the first approach, the velocity was about 0.77c, which is less than c. But if the products are moving at a higher velocity, perhaps the correct answer is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact formula without the approximation.

From the first approach, after using energy conservation:

gamma_A = (m_p c² (1 + gamma )) / (4 m_A c² )

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so:

gamma_A ≈ (2 m_p c² )/(4 m_A c² ) )= m_p/(2 m_A ) ≈ 938/(600) ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma_A = 1.563.

Then, beta_A = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A² ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(2.443)) )≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769.

So, beta_A ≈ 0.769, which is about 0.77c, option A.

But looking at the options, option C is 0.91c, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that gamma is 1 is incorrect. Because if the antiproton is moving, even slowly, gamma is slightly larger than 1.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Let me denote the initial momentum as p_initial ≈ m_p v.

But we can relate E_initial and p_initial via gamma.

E_initial = m_p c² + sqrt( (m_p c² )^2 + (m_p v c )^2 ) ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² sqrt(1 + (v²/c²)).

But for small v, we can approximate sqrt(1 + (v²/c²)) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So,

E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² [1 + (v²)/(2 c²) ] ≈ 2 m_p c² + (m_p v² )/(2 c²).

But the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

So, let's write the energy conservation equation more accurately.

Energy conservation:

E_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Momentum conservation:

p_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But u is the velocity of each A in the lab frame.

We can express u in terms of beta and c: u = beta c.

Similarly, gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So,

p_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A beta c.

So,

m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A beta c.

Now, from energy conservation:

m_p c² + sqrt( (m_p c² )^2 + (m_p v c )^2 ) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Let me denote E_pbar = sqrt( (m_p c² )^2 + (m_p v c )^2 ) = gamma m_p c².

So,

m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

m_p (1 + gamma) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

But from momentum:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A beta c.

So,

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A beta c.

Divide both sides by c:

gamma m_p v/c = 4 gamma_A m_A beta.

But from the energy equation:

gamma = (4 gamma_A m_A )/(m_p (1 + gamma) ) - 1.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps it's better to substitute gamma in terms of beta.

Wait, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2 ), where beta_p = v/c.

Similarly, gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ), where beta_A = u/c.

But this is getting into a system of equations with two variables, beta_p and beta_A.

But perhaps I can find a relationship between them.

Let me write the energy equation:

m_p c² (1 + gamma ) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

m_p (1 + gamma ) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Similarly, from the momentum equation:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A c.

Divide both sides by c:

gamma m_p (v/c) = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A.

So,

gamma m_p beta_p = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A.

Now, let me express gamma and gamma_A in terms of beta.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2 )

gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 )

Substituting into the momentum equation:

[1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2 )] * m_p beta_p = 4 [1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ) ] m_A beta_A.

But from the energy equation, we have:

m_p (1 + [1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2 ) ]) = 4 [1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ) ] m_A.

Let me denote:

Equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Equation 2: gamma m_p beta_p = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A.

Let me divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:

[gamma m_p beta_p ] / [ m_p (1 + gamma) ] = [4 gamma_A m_A beta_A ] / [4 gamma_A m_A ].

Simplify:

[ gamma beta_p ] / (1 + gamma) = beta_A.

So,

beta_A = [ gamma beta_p ] / (1 + gamma ).

Let me substitute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2 ) into this.

beta_A = [ (beta_p ) / sqrt(1 - beta_p^2) ) ] / [ 1 + 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2) ) ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - beta_p^2):

beta_A = [ beta_p ] / [ sqrt(1 - beta_p^2 ) + 1 ].

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can let x = beta_p and write beta_A in terms of x.

beta_A = x / ( sqrt(1 - x^2 ) + 1 ).

Now, let's substitute this into Equation 1.

Equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma ) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - x^2 ), so 1 + gamma = 1 + 1/sqrt(1 - x^2 ).

gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - [ x^2 / (sqrt(1 - x^2 ) + 1 )^2 ] ).

Let me compute gamma_A.

Compute denominator inside the sqrt:

1 - [x^2 / ( (sqrt(1-x^2 ) + 1 )^2 ) ].

= [ (sqrt(1 - x^2 ) + 1 )^2 - x^2 ] / (sqrt(1 -x^2 ) +1 )^2.

Expand numerator:

(1 - x^2 ) + 2 sqrt(1 - x^2 ) + 1 - x^2.

= 2 (1 - x^2 ) + 2 sqrt(1 - x^2 ) + 1.

Wait, no, let me compute (a + b)^2 where a = sqrt(1-x²), b=1.

(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² = (1 -x²) + 2 sqrt(1 -x² ) + 1 = 2 + 2 sqrt(1 - x² ) - x².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the denominator:

Denominator inside sqrt is [ (sqrt(1 -x²)+1 )^2 -x^2 ] / (sqrt(1-x² )+1 )^2.

= [ (1 -x² ) + 2 sqrt(1 -x² ) + 1 - x^2 ] / (sqrt(1-x² )+1 )^2.

= [ 2 (1 -x² ) + 2 sqrt(1 -x² ) ] / (sqrt(1-x² )+1 )^2.

Factor numerator:

2 (1 -x² ) (1 + sqrt(1 -x² ) ) / (sqrt(1-x² )+1 )^2.

Cancel (1 + sqrt(1 −x² )) terms:

= 2 (1 − x² ) / (sqrt(1 −x² ) + 1 ).

So,

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt( [ 2 (1 −x² ) ] / [ (sqrt(1 −x² ) +1 )^2 ] )

= sqrt( (sqrt(1 −x² ) +1 )^2 / [ 2 (1 −x² ) ] )

= (sqrt(1 −x^2 ) + 1 ) / sqrt( 2 (1 −x^2 ) )

So,

gamma_A = [ sqrt(1 −x^2 ) + 1 ] / [ sqrt(2 (1 -x^2 )) ].

But this is getting complicated. Let me plug this into Equation 1.

Equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma ) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

1 + gamma = 1 + 1/sqrt(1 - x^2 ) = [ sqrt(1 -x^2 ) + 1 ] / sqrt(1 -x^2 ).

So,

m_p [ ( sqrt(1 -x^2 ) +1 ) / sqrt(1 -x^2 ) ] = 4 [ ( sqrt(1 −x^2 ) +1 ) / sqrt(2 (1 -x^2 )) ) ] m_A.

Cancel ( sqrt(1 −x^2 ) +1 ) from both sides:

m_p / sqrt(1 -x^2 ) = 4 [ 1 / sqrt(2 (1 -x^2 )) ] m_A.

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2 (1 -x^2 )):

m_p sqrt(2) = 4 m_A.

So,

sqrt(2) m_p =4 m_A.

But m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

sqrt(2)*938 ≈ 1.414 * 938 ≈ 1329 MeV.

4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

So,

1329 ≈ 1200 → which is not correct.

Hmm, so this suggests that our assumption is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach was better, but I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should settle on the first approach and choose option A, 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Thus, the initial energy is approximately:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2,
     \]
     where \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The initial momentum is small due to the slow motion of the antiproton:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p v,
     \]
     where \( v \ll c \).

2. **Energy and Momentum Conservation**:
   - After annihilation, the total energy of the products is shared among the four \( A \)-particles. The rest mass energy of the products is:
     \[
     E_{\text{rest, products}} = 4 m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - The total energy of the products is:
     \[
     E_{\text{products}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2,
     \]
     where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_A^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles, and \( \beta_A = u/c \) is their velocity as a fraction of \( c \).

3. **Energy Conservation**:
   Using conservation of energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{products}}.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions:
   \[
   2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) to Velocity**:
   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by:
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_A^2}}.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   \beta_A = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma_A \approx 1.563 \):
   \[
   \beta_A = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.409} \approx \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.768.
   \]
   Thus, the velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately:
   \[
   u \approx 0.768c.
   \]

5. **Matching the Options**:
   The closest option to \( 0.768c \) is **0.77c**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \).
