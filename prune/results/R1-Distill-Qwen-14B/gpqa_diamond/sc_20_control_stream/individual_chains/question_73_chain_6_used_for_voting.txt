Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down. 

The problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, relativistic speeds mean I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity here.

First, I think about the relative speed. I remember that when you have two objects moving at relativistic speeds relative to each other, you can't just subtract their velocities like in Newtonian physics. Instead, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, the problem is about the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So which one is moving and which is the observer? Let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's the speed of B? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question just asks for the relative speed, but doesn't specify direction, so I guess it's the magnitude of the difference.

Wait, no, the relative speed when moving in the same direction would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.6c and 0.5c: so v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Using the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² => 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So overall, 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's one part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in relativity, each observer's energy is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But wait, when considering the system's total energy, should I just add the energies as measured in the same frame?

Wait, no. The problem is about the total energy of the system. So I think I need to calculate the total energy from the perspective of the rest frame where the combined system's momentum is zero. Wait, but that's complicated. Or perhaps, just sum the energies from the same frame, like the lab frame. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the frame, so perhaps the energies are the total energies from the same reference point.

Wait, the initial frame is probably the lab frame, perhaps where the two astronauts are moving as per given velocities. So each astronaut has their own energy. So the total energy E_total would be the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

Wait, each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for 0.6c: v²/c² is 0.36 so 1 - 0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, no, wait. Gamma is 1.25. So energy is gamma * m_i c². So for the first astronaut (2m), E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25, so 1 -0.25=0.75. sqrt is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547 (exactly it's 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547).

So energy E2 = gamma * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total is 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5 mc². So that's matching with 5.96, which would be option C?

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

First astronaut: 2m moving at 0.6c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: 3m at 0.5c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them, 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 ≈5.96 mc². So that's E=5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So that fits.

Wait, but let me check the relative speed calculation again. Because sometimes when you're dealing with the relative velocity, it's the velocity of one object as seen from the other. So I should determine which one is moving and from whose frame.

Wait, the problem says the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m), what is the speed of the second astronaut (3m) as seen from the first's frame?

So using the relativistic velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Here, u is the velocity of the second astronaut in the lab frame (which is 0.5c). v is the velocity of the first astronaut, which is 0.6c.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no: the lab frame is where the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second is moving at 0.5c. But wait, that's the same direction, so the second astronaut is moving slower. So from the first astronaut's frame, what is the speed of the second astronaut?

Wait, in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So in the lab frame, B is moving slower, but from A's perspective, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c² ) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since the question asks for relative speed, it's the magnitude, 0.14c.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check the velocity addition formula. Oh right: when you have two frames, S and S', moving at velocity v relative to S. In S, an object has velocity u. Then in S', it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this problem, in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c. So if I consider astronaut A's rest frame (S'), then the lab frame (S) is moving at -0.6c relative to S'. The astronaut B, in the lab frame, is moving at 0.5c. So in S' (A's frame), the speed u' of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c, so magnitude 0.14c.

Alternatively, you could compute it from B's frame. Let's think: What's the relative velocity of A as seen from B's frame?

Astronaut B is at rest in his own frame, moving at 0.5c in the lab. So the lab frame is moving at -0.5c relative to B's frame. In the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c. So in B's frame, A's velocity u' is (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c² ) = (0.1c)/(1-0.3) )= 0.1c / 0.7 ≈0.1428c.

Either way, the relative speed is about 0.14c.

So putting it all together: relative speed 0.14c, total energy 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect (\(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\)).
- **Option B**: Incorrect (\(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\)).
- **Option C**: Correct (\(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)).
- **Option D**: Incorrect (\(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\)).

**Answer: C**

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]
