Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm a bit rusty on my bicyclic compounds, but I remember that the bicyclo notation refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. So bicyclo[2.2.1] means there are two bridges: one with two carbons and another with two, and a single bridge as well. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached to the 7 position. So, the structure must have that oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and with dibromomethyl groups, I'm thinking this is an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, since there are two equivalents, maybe each of the two groups is reacting?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6). So each of those has two bromine atoms on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexene. When treated with a nucleophile like iodide, the dibromomethyl groups might undergo substitution. I think each Br would be replaced by iodide, but wait, wait. Dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, right? So each of those is a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but with two bromines on the same carbon, like a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, no, wait: dibromomethyl would be Br-CH2-Br. No, wait, wait—no: dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but wait, that's not possible because a methyl group can't have two Brs on the same carbon unless it's a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, but geminal dihalides are more like H2CBr2. So when you have CH2Br2, that's two Br atoms on a single carbon, which is a gem-dibromide.

So when each of those is treated with sodium iodide, perhaps it's a substitution. But wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So perhaps the Br is being replaced by iodide. But each of the two Brs on the methyl group would react, but wait, each methyl has two Brs. So each CH2Br2 would react twice, replacing each Br with iodide.

Wait, but maybe each CH2Br2 is undergoing substitution twice, replacing each Br with iodide. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But wait, is that possible? Because CH2I2 is a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 is undergoing substitution with iodide, but perhaps the reaction is more about elimination. Wait, wait, but the question says it's combined with sodium iodide. So substitution reactions are more likely.

Wait, but in any case, the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is reacting with the starting material. So the starting material is a diene, and perhaps this is a Diels-Alder type reaction? Because the starting material is a bicyclic diene, and the other molecule has two dienophile groups.

Wait, wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene structure, right? And norbornene is a good diene for Diels-Alder reactions. So if it's reacting with another dienophile, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups is acting as a dienophile.

So the starting material, which is a conjugated diene, would react with two equivalents of the dienophile. Let me think: the dienophile would have a structure that can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition. The 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: that's a conjugated diene as well. Wait, so perhaps each of those cyclohexa-1,3-diene rings can act as dienophiles.

Wait, but the dibromomethyl groups are on the 5 and 6 positions of the cyclohexene. So, when the Diels-Alder occurs, each of the dienophile groups (the cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would react with the norbornene diene.

Wait, but the starting compound is a bicyclo diene, so perhaps it's the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophiles would be the two cyclohexa-1,3-diene groups with the dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, but the dienophile is typically an electron-deficient diene, like a ketone or something with electron-withdrawing groups. But in this case, the dienophile is a cyclohexene with some substituents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a 6π electrocyclic ring-opening or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or another type of cycloaddition.

Wait, the starting material is a norbornene derivative, which is a bicyclic diene. The dienophile would be the other molecule. Since there are two equivalents, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with two dienophiles. But each dienophile is a cyclohexene with two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the bromide groups are replaced by something else.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is between the norbornene and the dienophile. The dienophile is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two substituents (dibromomethyl groups) at positions 5 and 6. So perhaps each dienophile is a dienophile in a separate Diels-Alder reaction.

So, the initial reaction would form a Diels-Alder adduct between the norbornene and one of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene groups. But since there are two such groups on the same ring, perhaps the norbornene reacts with each, leading to a bridged structure.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic diene, so when it reacts with a dienophile, it would form a six-membered ring with substituents. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the substitution of the bromides. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornene. Then, when combined with the dienophile and NaI, perhaps the Br in the dienophile is being replaced by I, making the dienophile more reactive.

Wait, but the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each CH2Br2 group is attached to the cyclohexene. When treated with NaI, perhaps the Br is replaced by I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2, but wait, that's not possible because CH2I2 is a possible compound, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by iodide, turning each CH2Br2 into CH2I2, but that would have two iodides on the same carbon, which is a bit unusual but possible.

But maybe the reaction is more about eliminating HBr. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene could undergo elimination when treated with a base. Wait, but NaI is more of a nucleophile, so substitution is more likely.

Wait, perhaps each CH2Br2 is undergoing two nucleophilic substitutions. So each Br is replaced by iodide. So, the structure becomes CH2I2 at positions 5 and 6. Then, the cyclohexene would have two CH2I2 groups.

But then, the next step is combining this with the starting material. Maybe the norbornene is reacting with this iodinated dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, so after substitution, the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl) (but wait, no, it's diiodomethyl). So the dienophile is now 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. But Diels-Alder typically requires a dienophile that's electron-deficient, like a carbonyl group. I'm not sure if diiodomethyl groups make the dienophile electron-deficient enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but a different type, like a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is opening into a diradical or something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, moving on to the next step. After the initial reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Sulfuric acid is often used for acid-catalyzed reactions, like hydrolysis or ring-opening.

Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, and pyridine is often used as a base in such reactions. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent and can act as an oxidizing agent in some cases. So perhaps product 2 is being sulfonated here.

After that, product 3 is heated at 150°C, giving the final product 4. Heating often leads to elimination or rearrangement reactions.

But perhaps I should try to visualize the overall process. Let me try to outline each step.

Step 1: Starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (norbornene with a t-butoxy group). Reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. So perhaps each dibromomethyl group is undergoing substitution, replacing Br with I. So the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Then, the norbornene (dienophile) reacts with the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. Since there are two dienophiles, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, adding two six-membered rings to the norbornene structure.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic structure, so adding two dienophiles would create a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with each of the two dienophiles in separate reactions.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a diene, and each of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene rings (with the diiodomethyl groups) is acting as dienophiles. So each dienophile would react with the norbornene, forming two Diels-Alder adducts. But with two equivalents, perhaps the norbornene reacts with each dienophile once.

Wait, but norbornene has two double bonds? No, norbornene has one double bond. So perhaps the norbornene can only undergo one Diels-Alder reaction. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the reaction is more about substitution and elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other compound is the diene. Wait, but the starting material is a diene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), so it's more likely the diene in a Diels-Alder. The other molecule, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, would be the dienophile. So, each cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a dienophile.

Wait, but the substitution step is when the dienophile's Br is replaced by I. So each dienophile (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two Brs on adjacent methyl groups. So after substitution, each Br becomes I, making the dienophile more electron-deficient (since I is a better leaving group and perhaps makes the dienophile more reactive).

So the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed between the norbornene diene and each dienophile. But since there are two equivalents of dienophile, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form. But norbornene has only one double bond, so maybe each dienophile reacts in a separate position, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not a Diels-Alder but another type of cycloaddition. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. But no, Diels-Alder typically forms a six-membered ring, not opening it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other molecule is the diene. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the substitution reaction first. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two CH2Br2 groups at 5 and 6. When treated with NaI, each Br is replaced by I, so each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. So the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Now, the dienophile has two CH2I2 groups.

Now, the Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornene and the dienophile. So the norbornene (dien) reacts with the dienophile (the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with CH2I2 groups) to form a six-membered ring adduct. But since there are two dienophiles (two equivalents), perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, leading to a more complex bicyclic structure.

Wait, but norbornene has only one double bond, so it can only participate in one Diels-Alder reaction. So maybe each dienophile is reacting with a different diene? But the starting material is only one diene (norbornene), so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the same as the diene, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution elsewhere. Another possibility is that the tert-butoxy group is undergoing some kind of substitution. But that's unlikely because it's a strong electron-donating group.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is between the norbornene and the dienophile, but the dienophile has two CH2Br groups that are undergoing substitution with iodide. So, each dienophile (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two CH2Br groups, which become CH2I after substitution. Then, perhaps each dienophile can react with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder fashion.

Wait, but each dienophile has two CH2Br groups, so substitution would first turn each Br into I. Then, the dienophile (now with CH2I groups) would react with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder, but I'm not sure how that affects the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile's substitution leads to a more electron-deficient dienophile, making the Diels-Alder reaction proceed more readily.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each step's possible transformations.

After the initial reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which forms product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Then product 3 is heated, giving product 4.

Hmmm. Another approach: perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder that forms a bridge structure, and then subsequent steps modify functional groups.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is forming a bridge by adding the dienophile across the norbornene's double bond. So the norbornene's double bond (between C2 and C5) would react with the dienophile, forming a six-membered ring adduct. But how?

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound with a double bond. The Diels-Alder reaction would add the dienophile across the double bond, forming a new six-membered ring. But perhaps each dienophile (there are two) adds in a way that creates a more complex structure, maybe a tricyclic compound.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let's think about the product 1 after the Diels-Alder reaction. Then, treating with H2SO4 could hydrolyze certain groups. For example, if product 1 has ester or ether groups, H2SO4 could protonate and cleave them. Alternatively, if there are epoxide groups, H2SO4 could open them, but I don't know if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 has iodide groups that are eliminated under acidic conditions. Wait, but after the Diels-Alder, the product would have the dienophile's substituents. If the dienophile has CH2I2 groups, then product 1 would have those. Under acidic conditions, perhaps those groups undergo elimination.

Wait, but CH2I2 is a rather unreactive group. Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct has some exo or endo substituents that can be modified.

Another thought: the SO3 and pyridine in DMSO step is a typical sulfonation condition. Maybe product 2 has a phenol group or an alcohol that gets sulfonated to form a sulfate ester or something similar, which then undergoes elimination upon heating.

Wait, perhaps the initial Diels-Alder adds two substituents (from the two dienophiles) to the norbornene, each substituent being a CH2I2 group. Then, product 1 would have two CH2I2 groups attached.

Then, treating with H2SO4 (aqueous) could cause the CH2I2 groups to undergo elimination. For example, perhaps the I groups leave, forming a double bond. But CH2I2 under acidic conditions might lose HI and form a double bond. Wait, but CH2I2 is a geminal dihalide. The reaction of gem-dihalides with strong acids typically leads to elimination, forming a double bond. So, each CH2I2 group would lose two molecules of HI, forming a double bond. So each CH2I2 would become a CH2 group with a double bond, but wait, that's not possible because you can't have a double bond in a single carbon. Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 group loses two HI molecules, turning into a CH2 group with adjacent double bonds? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, more accurately: a geminal dihalide (R-CH2-X)2 can undergo elimination upon treatment with a strong acid to form an alkene. For example, (CH3)2CBr2 → CH2=C(CH3)2 upon treatment with H2SO4. So in this case, each CH2I2 group would lose two HI molecules, forming a double bond. So each CH2I2 would become a CH2 group with a double bond adjacent, but wait, that's not possible because CH2 can't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 becomes CH2 with adjacent double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 group is on a cyclohexene ring. So the cyclohexene would have two CH2I2 groups. After elimination, each CH2I2 would lose two I and two H, forming a double bond. So the cyclohexene would become a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene or something? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2I2 group loses two I atoms, forming a double bond between adjacent carbons. So each CH2I2 would become a CH2 group with a double bond between the adjacent carbons (like a vinyl group). But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Moving on, after the elimination step (product 2), product 2 is then treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. This is likely a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is a strong sulfonating agent, and pyridine would help absorb the H2SO3 byproduct, making the reaction more efficient. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent.

So perhaps product 2 has a phenol group or an alcohol group that can be sulfonated. Alternatively, if product 2 has a double bond, maybe the sulfonation occurs on a double bond, but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a carbonyl group, which can undergo sulfonation, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if product 2 has a hydroxyl group, then SO3 would sulfonate it, forming a sulfonic acid group. For example, if product 2 has a phenolic OH group, sulfonation would occur on the aromatic ring, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. Heating often leads to elimination or rearrangement. For example, if product 3 has a sulfonic acid group and some leaving groups, heating might cause elimination, forming a double bond or a ring contraction.

But I'm not making much progress so far. Let me try to approach this by considering the overall structure.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornene. When it reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps each dienophile's Br is replaced by I, then the norbornene reacts with each dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but the norbornene can only react once, so perhaps each dienophile is reacting with a different part of the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is opening up into a larger ring, incorporating both dienophiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs on the norbornene. Wait, but the norbornene has a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Maybe the substitution is happening at that position. But I don't see any leaving groups there, so that's unlikely.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the oxygen of the tert-butoxy group acts as a nucleophile. But that's a poor nucleophile, so maybe not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to consider that the initial reaction forms a bridge or a larger ring, which is then modified in subsequent steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a radical substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, going back. The dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the two methyl groups has two Br atoms. When treated with NaI, each Br is replaced by I, making each methyl group CH2I2.

Then, the norbornene reacts with each of these dienophiles in a Diels-Alder reaction. But since norbornene has only one double bond, perhaps each dienophile adds to a different position, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile adds to the same double bond, but that's not possible because the Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition and can't add two dienophiles to the same diene.

Hmm. Maybe the initial reaction isn't a Diels-Alder. Let's think about elimination. The dienophile has CH2Br2 groups. Maybe the reaction is causing the elimination of HBr from these groups, forming double bonds.

Wait, wait, if the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups undergo elimination upon treatment with NaI, perhaps forming a diene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by I, and then elimination occurs.

Wait, but in aqueous H2SO4, elimination reactions are common. So perhaps, after substitution, the product is treated with acid, leading to elimination of HI and formation of a double bond.

So, product 1 after the initial reaction could be a Diels-Alder adduct with CH2I2 groups. Then, treating with H2SO4 (product 2) would cause elimination of HI from each CH2I2 group, forming a double bond.

So, product 2 would have two new double bonds where the CH2I2 groups were. Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO would sulfonate any available hydroxyl groups or other nucleophilic sites, forming product 3. Finally, heating product 3 would eliminate the sulfonic acid groups or cause some rearrangement, forming product 4.

But I'm not entirely sure about the sulfonation step. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination in product 2 creates a conjugated diene, which upon sulfonation forms a sulfonated diene, which upon heating undergoes further elimination.

But I'm not getting closer to the number of chemically distinct H atoms in product 4. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire process is building a more complex structure with multiple rings and substituents, leading to a certain symmetry, which affects the number of distinct H environments.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, leading to fewer distinct H atoms. For example, if the molecule has multiple planes of symmetry, the number of chemically distinct H's could be reduced.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the options: A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane or something similar, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, it could be a norbornene derivative with several substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly branched molecule with several equivalent H's.

But without a clear path through each reaction step, it's hard to say. Let me try to think of each step's possible outcome.

Step 1: Diels-Alder between norbornene (dien) and dienophile (cyclohexene with CH2I2 groups). Each dienophile adds to the norbornene, but since norbornene has only one diene, perhaps only one Diels-Alder occurs, but there are two equivalents, so maybe two adducts form. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile adds to the norbornene, leading to a more complex bridge structure.

Step 2: Treatment with H2SO4. This could protonate certain groups, leading to elimination of HI from the CH2I2 groups, forming double bonds.

Step 3: Sulfonation with SO3 and pyridine. Perhaps a sulfonic acid group is added to a phenolic OH, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Step 4: Heating leads to elimination or ring formation, possibly leading to a more condensed structure.

If the final structure is highly symmetrical, the number of distinct H's could be low. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some H's would be equivalent.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each step adds or removes certain groups, leading to a specific number of H environments.

Wait, let me think about the number of H's. The starting norbornene has a certain number of H's, and each reaction could add or remove substituents, altering the H count.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging to count. Maybe the final product has 8 distinct H's. Alternatively, perhaps after all the reactions, the molecule has a certain symmetry, leading to 4 or 7 distinct H's.

Looking at the options, option D is 7, which is an odd number, suggesting an asymmetric structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several equivalent H's.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the final product is a mono-substituted norbornene derivative, leading to a certain number of H's. Or perhaps it's a more complex structure with several substituents but with some symmetry.

Wait, if the final product has a symmetrical structure, such as two identical substituents on opposite sides, then some H's would be equivalent, reducing the count.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Maybe the correct answer is option D) 7.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the final product has 8 distinct H's, so option A.

Hmm. I think I need to make an educated guess here. Given the reaction steps, it's possible that the final product has a structure with several substituents, leading to 7 distinct H environments.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and progressing through substitution, elimination, sulfonation, and heating. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Reaction**: The starting material reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. The dibromomethyl groups undergo substitution, replacing bromine with iodine, forming 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This dienophile likely reacts with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a bicyclic adduct (product 1).

2. **Acid Treatment**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This step likely causes elimination of HI from the diiodomethyl groups, forming double bonds and simplifying the structure (product 2).

3. **Sulfonation**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This step introduces sulfonic acid groups, likely on nucleophilic sites such as hydroxyl groups or other reactive positions, forming product 3.

4. **Heating**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C, leading to further elimination or rearrangement, resulting in the final product (product 4).

The final product's structure is influenced by the symmetry and substituents introduced during the reaction sequence. Given the transformations, the final product likely has a complex but partially symmetrical structure. Based on the options provided, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is **7**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm a bit rusty on my bicyclic compounds, but I remember that the bicyclo notation refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. So bicyclo[2.2.1] means there are two bridges: one with two carbons and another with two, and a single bridge as well. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached to the 7 position. So, the structure must have that oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and with dibromomethyl groups, I'm thinking this is an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, since there are two equivalents, maybe each of the two groups is reacting?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6). So each of those has two bromine atoms on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexene. When treated with a nucleophile like iodide, the dibromomethyl groups might undergo substitution. I think each Br would be replaced by iodide, but wait, wait. Dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, right? So each of those is a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but with two bromines on the same carbon, like a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, no, wait: dibromomethyl would be Br-CH2-Br. No, wait, wait—no: dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but wait, that's not possible because a methyl group can't have two Brs on the same carbon unless it's a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, but geminal dihalides are more like H2CBr2. So when you have CH2Br2, that's two Br atoms on a single carbon, which is a gem-dibromide.

So when each of those is treated with sodium iodide, perhaps it's a substitution. But wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So perhaps the Br is being replaced by iodide. But each of the two Brs on the methyl group would react, but wait, each methyl has two Brs. So each CH2Br2 would react twice, replacing each Br with iodide.

Wait, but maybe each CH2Br2 is undergoing substitution twice, replacing each Br with iodide. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But wait, is that possible? Because CH2I2 is a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 is undergoing substitution with iodide, but perhaps the reaction is more about elimination. Wait, wait, but the question says it's combined with sodium iodide. So substitution reactions are more likely.

Wait, but in any case, the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is reacting with the starting material. So the starting material is a diene, and perhaps this is a Diels-Alder type reaction? Because the starting material is a bicyclic diene, and the other molecule has two dienophile groups.

Wait, wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene structure, right? And norbornene is a good diene for Diels-Alder reactions. So if it's reacting with another dienophile, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups is acting as a dienophile.

So the starting material, which is a conjugated diene, would react with two equivalents of the dienophile. Let me think: the dienophile would have a structure that can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition. The 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: that's a conjugated diene as well. Wait, so perhaps each of those cyclohexa-1,3-diene rings can act as dienophiles.

Wait, but the dibromomethyl groups are on the 5 and 6 positions of the cyclohexene. So, when the Diels-Alder occurs, each of the dienophile groups (the cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would react with the norbornene diene.

Wait, but the starting compound is a bicyclo diene, so perhaps it's the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophiles would be the two cyclohexa-1,3-diene groups with the dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, but the dienophile is typically an electron-deficient diene, like a ketone or something with electron-withdrawing groups. But in this case, the dienophile is a cyclohexene with some substituents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a 6π electrocyclic ring-opening or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or another type of cycloaddition.

Wait, the starting material is a norbornene derivative, which is a bicyclic diene. The dienophile would be the other molecule. Since there are two equivalents, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with two dienophiles. But each dienophile is a cyclohexene with two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the bromide groups are replaced by something else.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is between the norbornene and the dienophile. The dienophile is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two substituents (dibromomethyl groups) at positions 5 and 6. So perhaps each dienophile is a dienophile in a separate Diels-Alder reaction.

So, the initial reaction would form a Diels-Alder adduct between the norbornene and one of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene groups. But since there are two such groups on the same ring, perhaps the norbornene reacts with each, leading to a bridged structure.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic diene, so when it reacts with a dienophile, it would form a six-membered ring with substituents. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the substitution of the bromides. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornene. Then, when combined with the dienophile and NaI, perhaps the Br in the dienophile is being replaced by I, making the dienophile more reactive.

Wait, but the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each CH2Br2 group is attached to the cyclohexene. When treated with NaI, perhaps the Br is replaced by I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2, but wait, that's not possible because CH2I2 is a possible compound, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by iodide, turning each CH2Br2 into CH2I2, but that would have two iodides on the same carbon, which is a bit unusual but possible.

But maybe the reaction is more about eliminating HBr. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene could undergo elimination when treated with a base. Wait, but NaI is more of a nucleophile, so substitution is more likely.

Wait, perhaps each CH2Br2 is undergoing two nucleophilic substitutions. So each Br is replaced by iodide. So, the structure becomes CH2I2 at positions 5 and 6. Then, the cyclohexene would have two CH2I2 groups.

But then, the next step is combining this with the starting material. Maybe the norbornene is reacting with this iodinated dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, so after substitution, the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl) (but wait, no, it's diiodomethyl). So the dienophile is now 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. But Diels-Alder typically requires a dienophile that's electron-deficient, like a carbonyl group. I'm not sure if diiodomethyl groups make the dienophile electron-deficient enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but a different type, like a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is opening into a diradical or something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, moving on to the next step. After the initial reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Sulfuric acid is often used for acid-catalyzed reactions, like hydrolysis or ring-opening.

Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, and pyridine is often used as a base in such reactions. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent and can act as an oxidizing agent in some cases. So perhaps product 2 is being sulfonated here.

After that, product 3 is heated at 150°C, giving the final product 4. Heating often leads to elimination or rearrangement reactions.

But perhaps I should try to visualize the overall process. Let me try to outline each step.

Step 1: Starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (norbornene with a t-butoxy group). Reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. So perhaps each dibromomethyl group is undergoing substitution, replacing Br with I. So the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Then, the norbornene (dienophile) reacts with the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. Since there are two dienophiles, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, adding two six-membered rings to the norbornene structure.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic structure, so adding two dienophiles would create a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with each of the two dienophiles in separate reactions.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a diene, and each of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene rings (with the diiodomethyl groups) is acting as dienophiles. So each dienophile would react with the norbornene, forming two Diels-Alder adducts. But with two equivalents, perhaps the norbornene reacts with each dienophile once.

Wait, but norbornene has two double bonds? No, norbornene has one double bond. So perhaps the norbornene can only undergo one Diels-Alder reaction. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the reaction is more about substitution and elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other compound is the diene. Wait, but the starting material is a diene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), so it's more likely the diene in a Diels-Alder. The other molecule, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, would be the dienophile. So, each cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a dienophile.

Wait, but the substitution step is when the dienophile's Br is replaced by I. So each dienophile (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two Brs on adjacent methyl groups. So after substitution, each Br becomes I, making the dienophile more electron-deficient (since I is a better leaving group and perhaps makes the dienophile more reactive).

So the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed between the norbornene diene and each dienophile. But since there are two equivalents of dienophile, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form. But norbornene has only one double bond, so maybe each dienophile reacts in a separate position, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not a Diels-Alder but another type of cycloaddition. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. But no, Diels-Alder typically forms a six-membered ring, not opening it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other molecule is the diene. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the substitution reaction first. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two CH2Br2 groups at 5 and 6. When treated with NaI, each Br is replaced by I, so each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. So the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Now, the dienophile has two CH2I2 groups.

Now, the Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornene and the dienophile. So the norbornene (dien) reacts with the dienophile (the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with CH2I2 groups) to form a six-membered ring adduct. But since there are two dienophiles (two equivalents), perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, leading to a more complex bicyclic structure.

Wait, but norbornene has only one double bond, so it can only participate in one Diels-Alder reaction. So maybe each dienophile is reacting with a different diene? But the starting material is only one diene (norbornene), so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the same as the diene, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution elsewhere. Another possibility is that the tert-butoxy group is undergoing some kind of substitution. But that's unlikely because it's a strong electron-donating group.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is between the norbornene and the dienophile, but the dienophile has two CH2Br groups that are undergoing substitution with iodide. So, each dienophile (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two CH2Br groups, which become CH2I after substitution. Then, perhaps each dienophile can react with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder fashion.

Wait, but each dienophile has two CH2Br groups, so substitution would first turn each Br into I. Then, the dienophile (now with CH2I groups) would react with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder, but I'm not sure how that affects the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile's substitution leads to a more electron-deficient dienophile, making the Diels-Alder reaction proceed more readily.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each step's possible transformations.

After the initial reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which forms product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Then product 3 is heated, giving product 4.

Hmmm. Another approach: perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder that forms a bridge structure, and then subsequent steps modify functional groups.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is forming a bridge by adding the dienophile across the norbornene's double bond. So the norbornene's double bond (between C2 and C5) would react with the dienophile, forming a six-membered ring adduct. But how?

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound with a double bond. The Diels-Alder reaction would add the dienophile across the double bond, forming a new six-membered ring. But perhaps each dienophile (there are two) adds in a way that creates a more complex structure, maybe a tricyclic compound.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let's think about the product 1 after the Diels-Alder reaction. Then, treating with H2SO4 could hydrolyze certain groups. For example, if product 1 has ester or ether groups, H2SO4 could protonate and cleave them. Alternatively, if there are epoxide groups, H2SO4 could open them, but I don't know if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 has iodide groups that are eliminated under acidic conditions. Wait, but after the Diels-Alder, the product would have the dienophile's substituents. If the dienophile has CH2I2 groups, then product 1 would have those. Under acidic conditions, perhaps those groups undergo elimination.

Wait, but CH2I2 is a rather unreactive group. Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct has some exo or endo substituents that can be modified.

Another thought: the SO3 and pyridine in DMSO step is a typical sulfonation condition. Maybe product 2 has a phenol group or an alcohol that gets sulfonated to form a sulfate ester or something similar, which then undergoes elimination upon heating.

Wait, perhaps the initial Diels-Alder adds two substituents (from the two dienophiles) to the norbornene, each substituent being a CH2I2 group. Then, product 1 would have two CH2I2 groups attached.

Then, treating with H2SO4 (aqueous) could cause the CH2I2 groups to undergo elimination. For example, perhaps the I groups leave, forming a double bond. But CH2I2 under acidic conditions might lose HI and form a double bond. Wait, but CH2I2 is a geminal dihalide. The reaction of gem-dihalides with strong acids typically leads to elimination, forming a double bond. So, each CH2I2 group would lose two molecules of HI, forming a double bond. So each CH2I2 would become a CH2 group with a double bond, but wait, that's not possible because you can't have a double bond in a single carbon. Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 group loses two HI molecules, turning into a CH2 group with adjacent double bonds? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, more accurately: a geminal dihalide (R-CH2-X)2 can undergo elimination upon treatment with a strong acid to form an alkene. For example, (CH3)2CBr2 → CH2=C(CH3)2 upon treatment with H2SO4. So in this case, each CH2I2 group would lose two HI molecules, forming a double bond. So each CH2I2 would become a CH2 group with a double bond adjacent, but wait, that's not possible because CH2 can't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 becomes CH2 with adjacent double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 group is on a cyclohexene ring. So the cyclohexene would have two CH2I2 groups. After elimination, each CH2I2 would lose two I and two H, forming a double bond. So the cyclohexene would become a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene or something? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2I2 group loses two I atoms, forming a double bond between adjacent carbons. So each CH2I2 would become a CH2 group with a double bond between the adjacent carbons (like a vinyl group). But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Moving on, after the elimination step (product 2), product 2 is then treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. This is likely a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is a strong sulfonating agent, and pyridine would help absorb the H2SO3 byproduct, making the reaction more efficient. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent.

So perhaps product 2 has a phenol group or an alcohol group that can be sulfonated. Alternatively, if product 2 has a double bond, maybe the sulfonation occurs on a double bond, but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a carbonyl group, which can undergo sulfonation, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if product 2 has a hydroxyl group, then SO3 would sulfonate it, forming a sulfonic acid group. For example, if product 2 has a phenolic OH group, sulfonation would occur on the aromatic ring, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. Heating often leads to elimination or rearrangement. For example, if product 3 has a sulfonic acid group and some leaving groups, heating might cause elimination, forming a double bond or a ring contraction.

But I'm not making much progress so far. Let me try to approach this by considering the overall structure.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornene. When it reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps each dienophile's Br is replaced by I, then the norbornene reacts with each dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but the norbornene can only react once, so perhaps each dienophile is reacting with a different part of the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is opening up into a larger ring, incorporating both dienophiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs on the norbornene. Wait, but the norbornene has a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Maybe the substitution is happening at that position. But I don't see any leaving groups there, so that's unlikely.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the oxygen of the tert-butoxy group acts as a nucleophile. But that's a poor nucleophile, so maybe not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to consider that the initial reaction forms a bridge or a larger ring, which is then modified in subsequent steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a radical substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, going back. The dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the two methyl groups has two Br atoms. When treated with NaI, each Br is replaced by I, making each methyl group CH2I2.

Then, the norbornene reacts with each of these dienophiles in a Diels-Alder reaction. But since norbornene has only one double bond, perhaps each dienophile adds to a different position, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile adds to the same double bond, but that's not possible because the Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition and can't add two dienophiles to the same diene.

Hmm. Maybe the initial reaction isn't a Diels-Alder. Let's think about elimination. The dienophile has CH2Br2 groups. Maybe the reaction is causing the elimination of HBr from these groups, forming double bonds.

Wait, wait, if the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups undergo elimination upon treatment with NaI, perhaps forming a diene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by I, and then elimination occurs.

Wait, but in aqueous H2SO4, elimination reactions are common. So perhaps, after substitution, the product is treated with acid, leading to elimination of HI and formation of a double bond.

So, product 1 after the initial reaction could be a Diels-Alder adduct with CH2I2 groups. Then, treating with H2SO4 (product 2) would cause elimination of HI from each CH2I2 group, forming a double bond.

So, product 2 would have two new double bonds where the CH2I2 groups were. Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO would sulfonate any available hydroxyl groups or other nucleophilic sites, forming product 3. Finally, heating product 3 would eliminate the sulfonic acid groups or cause some rearrangement, forming product 4.

But I'm not entirely sure about the sulfonation step. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination in product 2 creates a conjugated diene, which upon sulfonation forms a sulfonated diene, which upon heating undergoes further elimination.

But I'm not getting closer to the number of chemically distinct H atoms in product 4. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire process is building a more complex structure with multiple rings and substituents, leading to a certain symmetry, which affects the number of distinct H environments.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, leading to fewer distinct H atoms. For example, if the molecule has multiple planes of symmetry, the number of chemically distinct H's could be reduced.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the options: A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane or something similar, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, it could be a norbornene derivative with several substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly branched molecule with several equivalent H's.

But without a clear path through each reaction step, it's hard to say. Let me try to think of each step's possible outcome.

Step 1: Diels-Alder between norbornene (dien) and dienophile (cyclohexene with CH2I2 groups). Each dienophile adds to the norbornene, but since norbornene has only one diene, perhaps only one Diels-Alder occurs, but there are two equivalents, so maybe two adducts form. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile adds to the norbornene, leading to a more complex bridge structure.

Step 2: Treatment with H2SO4. This could protonate certain groups, leading to elimination of HI from the CH2I2 groups, forming double bonds.

Step 3: Sulfonation with SO3 and pyridine. Perhaps a sulfonic acid group is added to a phenolic OH, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Step 4: Heating leads to elimination or ring formation, possibly leading to a more condensed structure.

If the final structure is highly symmetrical, the number of distinct H's could be low. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some H's would be equivalent.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each step adds or removes certain groups, leading to a specific number of H environments.

Wait, let me think about the number of H's. The starting norbornene has a certain number of H's, and each reaction could add or remove substituents, altering the H count.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging to count. Maybe the final product has 8 distinct H's. Alternatively, perhaps after all the reactions, the molecule has a certain symmetry, leading to 4 or 7 distinct H's.

Looking at the options, option D is 7, which is an odd number, suggesting an asymmetric structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several equivalent H's.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the final product is a mono-substituted norbornene derivative, leading to a certain number of H's. Or perhaps it's a more complex structure with several substituents but with some symmetry.

Wait, if the final product has a symmetrical structure, such as two identical substituents on opposite sides, then some H's would be equivalent, reducing the count.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Maybe the correct answer is option D) 7.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the final product has 8 distinct H's, so option A.

Hmm. I think I need to make an educated guess here. Given the reaction steps, it's possible that the final product has a structure with several substituents, leading to 7 distinct H environments.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and progressing through substitution, elimination, sulfonation, and heating. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Reaction**: The starting material reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. The dibromomethyl groups undergo substitution, replacing bromine with iodine, forming 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This dienophile likely reacts with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a bicyclic adduct (product 1).

2. **Acid Treatment**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This step likely causes elimination of HI from the diiodomethyl groups, forming double bonds and simplifying the structure (product 2).

3. **Sulfonation**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This step introduces sulfonic acid groups, likely on nucleophilic sites such as hydroxyl groups or other reactive positions, forming product 3.

4. **Heating**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C, leading to further elimination or rearrangement, resulting in the final product (product 4).

The final product's structure is influenced by the symmetry and substituents introduced during the reaction sequence. Given the transformations, the final product likely has a complex but partially symmetrical structure. Based on the options provided, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is **7**.

Answer: D
