Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the state of a system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector has to be normalized. So I should probably check if this vector is normalized first. Let me compute its norm.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized yet. So I need to normalize it for the calculations. Right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized.

So the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). Let me write that down. The normalized state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Got it.

Now, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P is given with three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, wait. Let me represent that properly.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, I'm trying to remember what this means. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, an observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So the eigenvalues of P would give me the possible results when I measure the observable.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of getting the measurement 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

Alternatively, since it's a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P first.

Let me start by finding the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, let's set up the matrix (P - λ I):

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [...] 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to expand along the first row.

Expanding the determinant:

= -λ * det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] 
- (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) ]
+ 0 * det(..., which is irrelevant since multiplied by zero)

So the first term is -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

That's -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

The second term is -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 

Which simplifies to -(1/√2) * ( -λ / √2 ) 

Which is -(1/√2) * ( -λ / √2 ) = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ) / 2

So putting it all together:

det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) 

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

Wait, no: because the expansion is:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) + (-1/√2) * ( (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ) ) + 0

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let's recount.

The expansion for the determinant is:

= a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

So for the first row:

a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c=0.

The minors are:

M11 is the determinant of the submatrix:
[ -λ, 1/√2 ]
[ 1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2.

M12 is the determinant of the submatrix:
[1/√2, 1/√2 ]
[0, -λ ]

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/(√2)

Now, the determinant is:

a*M11 - b*M12 + c*M13

c is 0, so the last term is zero.

So:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/(√2) ) 

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) )

Because (1/√2)*( -λ/(√2) ) is (-λ)/(2), and because of the sign in the determinant equation, it's minus that: - (1/√2) * (-λ/(√2)) ) = lambda/(2).

So the determinant becomes:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (lambda/2) 

Hmm, combining the terms: (lambda/2 + lambda/2 ) is lambda.

So det = -lambda³ + lambda.

Set this equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0 → λ = 0 or λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So the possible measurement outcomes for the observable P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We'll solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0 ]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0 ]

So the equations are:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (v1 + v3 ) /√2 =0 → v1 +v3 =0.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0, same as equation 1.

So the conditions are v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) ) → which can be written as v1 (1, 0, -1)^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1)^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the state vector.

But wait, the state vector we have is the normalized one: [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ) ]^T.

The eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T, but we need to normalize it as well.

Wait, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So the probability is the square of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector.

Let me compute that inner product.

Let me denote the state vector as |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6) , 2/sqrt(6) , 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

The eigenvector |v> is [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

The inner product <v | ψ> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6) )

Simplify each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So the inner product is [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] + [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] = (-2)/(2√3) ) = (-1)/√3.

The absolute value squared is (1/√3 )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there's another approach, just to be thorough.

Another approach: The observable is P. The matrix P is given. The possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1, as we found. The probability to get 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenspace of 0.

But since it's a non-degenerate eigenvalue (eigenspace is 1D), the probability is the square of the amplitude as I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the expectation value, but wait no, the expectation is the average value. The probability is the modulus squared of the inner product.

So I think the correct answer is 1/3. So option C.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state vector. The state vector is initially given as \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we analyze the observable \( P \), represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant and solving, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

The question asks for the probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \). To find this, we determine the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \). Solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is normalized to:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the normalized state \( |\psi\rangle \) and the normalized eigenvector \( |v\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( \frac{1}{3} \)**
