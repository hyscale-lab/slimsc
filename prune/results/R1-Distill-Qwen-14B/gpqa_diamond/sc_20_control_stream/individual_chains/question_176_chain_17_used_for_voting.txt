Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm. Let me see what the question is asking. So, the system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check the length of this vector. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squared modulus is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the vector isn't normalized. Hmm, but when measuring observables, we probably need a unit vector. So maybe I should normalize it first. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's already normalized? Wait, maybe I should proceed as is.

The operators for P and Q are given. Let me write them down.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. And operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1,0,0
Second: 0,0,0
Third: 0,0,-1

So Q is a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues.

The question: measure P first, then Q. The probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, the subsequent measurement of Q is on that new state.

But wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Oh, no, the question says first measure P, then Q. So the process is:

1. Measure P, get outcome 0. The state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Then measure Q on that state, and get outcome -1.

So the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, but actually, since the first measurement affects the state, I think I need to compute the probability of getting 0 for P, and then given that, the probability of getting -1 for Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined probability is the sum over all possible states, but I think in this case, since we have a specific outcome for each measurement, it's the probability that both happen in sequence.

Let me think step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P with the measured value as the eigenvalue.

So operator P's matrix:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Wait, let me write this in matrix form. Let me see:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Hmm. Because the measurement of P will project the state into an eigenvector of P. So, the eigenvalues could be 0 and others.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to see the possible outcomes. Let's see: operator Q has possible values 1, 0, -1. So when measuring Q, the possible eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 in P and -1 in Q. So for P, the eigenvalue is 0, and for Q, the eigenvalue is -1.

But the process is: measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1.

So I need to find the probability that the first measurement gives 0 for P, and the second measurement gives -1 for Q, given the first outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the product of the probability of the first event and the conditional probability of the second.

Let me find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into that eigenvector.

So to find the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0, I need to solve (P - 0 * I) v = 0.

So the matrix P is as written. So the equations are:

Row 1: (0) v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → same as row 1, v2 =0.

So the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 of P are vectors where v2=0, v3= -v1. So the general solution is v = (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1].

But wait, we can normalize it. The vector [1, 0, -1] has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2))(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenstate for P with eigenvalue 0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

So the first step is measuring P and getting 0. The probability of this is the square of the amplitude of the component of the initial state in the direction of this eigenvector.

Wait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me make sure it's normalized. As I calculated earlier, its norm is sqrt(6). So I should normalize it first. Let me define the initial state as |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) / sqrt(6).

So |ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0 is |e_p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

The probability amplitude is the inner product between |ψ> and |e_p0>.

So the inner product is:

( -1/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2) )

Simplify each term:

First term: (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)).

Third term: (1) * (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)).

So the total inner product is [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) + 0 + (-1/(sqrt(12)) ) ] = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12)=1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So the inner product is [ (-1/(2 sqrt(3)) ) + (-1/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value. So | (-1/sqrt(3)) |^2 = (1/3).

So the probability of measuring P and getting 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but that's just the first part. Now, after getting 0 for P, the state collapses to the eigenvector |e_p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, we measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Wait, Q's matrix is:

[1 0 0;

0 0 0;

0 0 -1]

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So for eigenvalue 1, it's e1=(1,0,0); for 0, it's e2=(0,1,0); for -1, e3=(0,0,1).

So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

But we want the outcome to be -1. So the state after P's measurement is |e_p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

The probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |e_p0> in the direction of |e3> (e3 is (0,0,1)).

The amplitude is the inner product of |e_p0> and |e3>:

(1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 *0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) *1 = (-1/sqrt(2)).

The absolute square is (1/2).

So the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. The state after P's measurement is |e_p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So when measuring Q, which is diagonal, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The probability for each is the square of the modulus of the corresponding component in the state.

So the components are:

First component: 1/sqrt(2) → squared is 1/2 → so for outcome 1, probability 1/2.

Third component: -1/sqrt(2) → squared is 1/2 → outcome -1 has probability 1/2.

Wait, but the second component is 0, so outcome 0 would have probability 0.

Wait, so in the state |e_p0>, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the total probability we're looking for is the product of the probabilities of each measurement, given the previous outcome. So first, the probability of getting 0 for P is 1/3. Then, given that, the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2. So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because the first measurement changes the state. So it's not a product of two independent probabilities, but the first affects the second.

So the total probability is the probability that P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability that Q=-1 given that P=0. Which is 1/2.

So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculation of the inner product for the initial state and the eigenvector of P.

Initial state |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).

Eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0: |e_p0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

The inner product is:

( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).

So:

= (-1)/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)) + 0 - (1)/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)).

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3).

So, (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3), correct.

So the first probability is 1/3.

Then, the state after P=0 is |e_p0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

When we measure Q, which is diagonal, the possible outcomes are the diagonal elements. So the state is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component, which is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

So yes, the probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

The system's state is given as a column vector \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), which is not normalized. Its norm is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Measurement of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalue 0 of \( P \), solve \( (P - 0I)v = 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is:

\[
|e_{P0}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |e_{P0}\rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | e_{P0} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | e_{P0} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot (-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle \psi | e_{P0} \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Measurement of \( Q \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Its eigenvalues are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), \( |e_2\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), and \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |e_{P0}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the third component of \( |e_{P0}\rangle \):

\[
\text{Probability of } Q = -1 = \left| \langle e_3 | e_{P0} \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Combined Probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
