Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant, m is mass, and A is amplitude.

But wait, this is a relativistic case. Oh right, in relativity, velocities can't exceed the speed of light, c. So the classical formula might not hold here because as speeds approach c, relativistic effects become significant.

I think in special relativity, the momentum and energy have to be considered with gamma factors. The energy of the oscillator would then involve relativistic kinetic energy. Oh, right, the relativistic energy for a particle is E = gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but the harmonic oscillator's total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy would be E_total = (gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

At maximum speed, the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium position (x=0), so all energy is kinetic. But wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, so the entire potential energy is converted into kinetic. But maybe in the relativistic case, it's the same point.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. So at maximum speed, the system's energy is entirely kinetic. So E_total = (gamma) mc², because when x=0, the potential is zero, so E = kinetic energy which is (gamma -1) mc² + 0. Wait, no: at x=0, the oscillator has maximum speed, so all the energy is kinetic, but in relativistic terms, E = gamma mc². But wait, the total energy of the oscillator comes from its potential and kinetic parts, but when x is maximum (A), the speed is zero, so all energy is potential.

Wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator's case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA² in the classical case. So in the relativistic case, the maximum potential energy would be when x is at maximum, so at x=A, velocity is zero. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativistic physics, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? I think so because the spring exerts a force F = -kx as given. So the potential energy should still be (1/2)kx².

So the total energy E of the oscillator would be (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy when x=A and velocity is zero. Then, when the mass passes through x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So setting the total energy equal to that, we have:

E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, that makes sense. So (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Let me rearrange this equation. So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Because E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

I need to solve for v. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, let me denote (kA²/(2 m c^2)) as a variable for simplicity. Let's say a = kA²/(2 m c²). Then, gamma = 1 + a.

So 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + a.

Square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+a)^2].

Calculate that: v²/c² = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expand (1 + a)^2: 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator is (1 + 2a + a² - 1 ) = 2a + a².

So v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + 2a + a²) = [a (2 + a)] / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (kA²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug it back.

v² = c² * [ (kA²/(2 m c²)) (2 + kA²/(2 m c²)) ] / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) )^2.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps there's a simplification. Let me factor the numerator:

numerator = a (2 + a) = (kA²/(2 m c²)) (2 + kA²/(2 m c²)).

Denominator = (1 + a)^2.

Let me compute denominator first:

1 + a = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² ).

So denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2.

Numerator:

a (2 + a ) = [ k A²/(2 m c²) ] * [ 2 + k A²/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A²/(2 m c²) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, 2 is 2*(2 m c²)/(2 m c²) → 2 = 4 m c²/(2 m c²).

So 2 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²).

So the numerator becomes [ k A²/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting it all together, the numerator is [k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

The denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2 → [ (2 m c² +k A²)^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So v² = c² * [ numerator ] / denominator.

So v² = c² * [ [k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c² +k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

Simplify the fractions:

The denominator of the denominator (4 m² c^4 ) cancels with the numerator's denominator (4 m² c^4 ).

So v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / [ (2 m c² +k A² )^2 ]

Let me factor out 2 m c² from the terms in the numerator and denominator.

Wait, 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c²). Hmm, perhaps factor 2 m c² as a common factor. Let me see:

4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) +k A². Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, let's denote D = 2 m c² +k A². Then:

4 m c^2 +k A² = 2 m c² + (2 m c² + k A²) ) = 2 m c² + D.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor 2 m c² from both terms in 4 m c² + k A².

Wait, 4 m c² = 2*(2 m c²). So 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A².

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write 4 m c² +k A² = 2*(2 m c²) +k A² = 2*(2 m c² + (k A²)/2 ) → but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed by dividing numerator and denominator by (2 m c²)^2 to see if that helps.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the ratio:

[k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / [ (2 m c² +k A² )^2 ]

= [k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / [ (2 m c² +k A² )^2 ]

Let me factor out 2 m c² from each term inside, perhaps.

Let me write 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c²), so:

4 m c² +k A² = 2*(2 m c²) +k A² = 2 m c² (2) ) + k A².

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, let me factor 2 m c² from the denominator:

(2 m c² +k A² )^2 = [ 2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = (2 m c²)^2 (1 + a )^2, where a is kA²/(2 m c²).

But in any case, perhaps it's easier to just compute the expression as is.

Wait, perhaps let me consider that the denominator is (2 m c² +k A² )^2. The numerator has (4 m c² +k A²) multiplied by k A².

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that 4 m c² +k A² = (2 m c²)*2 +k A² = not sure.

Wait, let me think about the initial equation again.

We have:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

gamma = 1 + a, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

And gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So, v²/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Which can be written as [ (1 + a)^2 -1 ] / (1 +a)^2 = [ (1 + 2a + a² ) -1 ]/(1 +a)^2 = (2a + a² )/(1 +a)^2.

So, v² = c² [ (2a + a² )/(1 +a)^2 ].

Factor numerator: a(2 + a) / (1 +a)^2.

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Let me write this as:

v² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Simplify numerator:

The first term in the numerator is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

The second term is 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) → which is (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, the product is (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (4 m c² +k A²)/(2 m c²) = [k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / [ (2 m c²)^2 ].

Denominator is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 = [ (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = (2 m c² +k A² )^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

So putting together:

v² = c² * [ [k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / (2 m c²)^2 ] / [ (2 m c² +k A² )^2 / (2 m c²)^2 ]

The (2 m c²)^2 cancels in numerator and denominator.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² +k A²) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor out 2 m c² from numerator and denominator.

Wait, 4 m c² = 2*(2 m c² ), so:

4 m c² +k A² = 2*(2 m c² ) +k A².

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor 2 m c² as D, so D= 2 m c².

Then,

v² = c² * [k A² (2 D +k A² ) ] / (D +k A² )^2.

Hmm, perhaps that's better.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (2 D +k A²) ] / (D +k A² )^2.

Let me write it as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 ( (2 D +k A²) ) ] / (D +k A² )^2.

But D = 2 m c², so:

v² = c² * [k A² ( 4 m c² +k A² ) ] / ( 2 m c² +k A² )^2.

Hmm. Let me see if I can factor this.

Wait, 4 m c² +k A² = 2*(2 m c²) ) +k A^2. Let me factor 2 m c² as D again.

Wait, perhaps I can write 4 m c² +k A² = (2 m c² +k A² ) + 2 m c².

So,

(4 m c² +k A² ) = (2 m c² +k A²) + 2 m c².

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² ( (2 m c² +k A² ) + 2 m c² ) ) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

= c² * [ k A² (2 m c² +k A² + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

= c² * [ k A² (4 m c² +k A² ) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification here.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed to compute this expression and see which of the options it matches.

Let me compute the expression:

v^2 = c^2 [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Hmm, perhaps let me think about the denominator: (2 m c² +k A²)^2.

The numerator has (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) which is 2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2.

Wait, let me write the numerator as:

k A² (4 m c² +k A² ) = k A² [ 2*(2 m c^2) +k A² ].

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear way to simplify, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I can take the initial equation for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c² )

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c² )

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (2 m c² +k A² )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - (4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

Wait, that's another way to write it.

So,

v^2 = c² [ 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 ) / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps that's easier.

Let me compute (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

(2 m c² +k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c²)^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A^2) + (k A^2)^2 = 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 ) ]

= c^2 [ ( (4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 ) - 4 m² c^4 ) / denominator ]

= c^2 [ (4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 ) / denominator ]

Denominator is (4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ 4 m c² k A² +k² A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 )

Factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator can be written as k A^2 (4 m c² +k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So,

v² = c^2 * [ k A^2 (4 m c² +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2.

Which brings us back to the same expression as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps try plugging in the options to see which one matches.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: v_max = c*sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, that seems to involve (1 - kA²/(2m)) in the denominator.

But in our case, the denominator is (1 + a )^2, where a is (kA²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, not exactly matching.

Option B: v_max = c*sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, that would be sqrt(1 + [ 1/(1 - a) ] ), where a is (kA²)/(2 m c² )

But our expression is more complicated than that. Let me see.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( kA²/m )

That's the classical expression. But in relativity, we can't have speeds beyond c, so this can't be correct unless kA²/(2m) is less than c², but this option doesn't involve c, which is a problem because for large kA², it would give v larger than c.

So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Hmm, let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 where a = (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] = [ (1 +a )^2 -1 ] / (1 +a )^2 = (2a +a² )/(1 +a )^2.

Which is exactly what v²/c² is, as we derived.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2a +a^2]/(1 +a )^2 ) )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( [a (2 +a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )

But a is (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (kA²)/(2 m c² ) * (2 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm. Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

(kA²)/(2 m c² ) * (2 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * [ (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So the numerator becomes sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 ) )

= [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the expression in option D is correct.

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c*sqrt(1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which is exactly the expression we have for v^2/c^2, because v²/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 +a )^2 ].

So, sqrt of (1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ) is v_max/c.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D was the correct one. Let me check.

Wait, let's recap: We found that v^2 = c^2 * [1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ] where a=(kA^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - (1/(1+a)^2) ]

Which is the same as option D.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which is exactly what we have.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we start by considering the relativistic energy relationship. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

At maximum amplitude (\( x = A \)), the oscillator's speed is zero, and the total energy is entirely potential energy, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), the speed is maximum, and the total energy is entirely relativistic kinetic energy, \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at both points:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and simplifying:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve terms inconsistent with the derived expression.
- **Option C** is the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects and is therefore incorrect.
- **Option D** matches the derived expression exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
