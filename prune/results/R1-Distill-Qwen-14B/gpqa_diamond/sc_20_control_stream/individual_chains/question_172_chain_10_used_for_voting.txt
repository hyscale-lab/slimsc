Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. So, there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait, the question says "twice as excited." Do they mean twice the excitation energy, or twice the number of atoms in that excited state?

I think it's about the population of atoms in that energy level. So, the population of iron atoms in a certain energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm.

The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2. And it's assuming LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here. Yeah, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

Boltzmann's formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of energy levels i and j, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, maybe they're considering the same lower energy level (ground state) and an excited state. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So, the population ratio would be n2 / n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

Wait, but in the question, it's about the excitation of the same energy level. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is comparing the same energy level in the two stars. Or maybe it's about the same transition. Wait, no, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. So, for each star, the same energy difference, but the excitation (population) is different. So, for star 1, the population is twice that of star 2 in the same energy level. So, maybe we can model this using the Boltzmann factor.

Let me think: For star 1, n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, the number of excited atoms in star 1 is twice that of star 2. Wait, maybe the ratio n_upper / n_lower is different for each star.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations in the same energy level between the two stars is 2:1. So, n1 / n2 = 2, where n is the population of that specific energy level.

Wait, but the Boltzmann distribution is about the ratio between two energy levels. So, if the same energy level is being considered in both stars, perhaps I need to think about the ratio of their populations.

Alternatively, maybe each star has two energy levels with a given energy difference, and the population in the higher level for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

Wait, perhaps each star's photosphere has the same energy levels, but the populations are different because their temperatures are different. So, for each star, the ratio n_upper / n_lower = exp( - delta E / (k T) ), where delta E is 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but in the question, it's said that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Maybe that's the ratio of the number of atoms in that level compared to another. Let's suppose that the considered energy level is the excited state. So, for each star, the population in the excited state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same energy level in each star, but the excitation (the population) is twice in star_1 compared to star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2, where n is the population in that energy level.

But wait, in the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, if we have the same two energy levels in each star, then for star 1, the ratio would be:

n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2:

n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

But the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, meaning perhaps that the number in the higher state is twice that of star_2. Wait, but the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". Hmm, maybe it's the same level. So, star_1 has twice as many atoms in that level as star_2 does in the same level? Or perhaps it's comparing the same level relative to another.

Wait, maybe the problem is that for star_1, the population in the considered energy level (say, E2) is twice that of star_2's population in E2. But that seems a bit odd, because the population depends on both temperature and the level's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps each star's ratio of the considered energy level to the ground level is different. So, n2 / n1 for star 1 is a certain value, and for star 2 it's another.

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. Maybe this means that in star_1, the population in that level is higher than in star_2. But without knowing the reference level, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we're considering the ratio of the populations in the same energy level. For example, for each star, the population of a certain excited state relative to the ground state. So, for star_1, (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps let's think about it differently. Let me denote the energy levels as E_1 (lower) and E_2 (upper), with delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

In star 1, the population ratio is (n2 / n1) = exp( - delta E / (k T1) )

In star 2, it's (n2' / n1') = exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

But the problem says that the population in star_1's E2 is twice that in star_2's E2. But wait, each star's E2 population depends on their own temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the two populations is 2:1.

Wait, but wait the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star_2. So, perhaps in star_1, the number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much as in star_2. But to compare that, both would have the same lower level population? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the excitation is the ratio of the upper level to the lower level, and in star_1, that ratio is twice as big as in star_2.

Wait, but the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". Hmm, perhaps it's comparing the same energy level. If it's the same level, then the population for each star depends on their temperature.

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense. The same energy level would have different populations based on T, but I think the question is about the same energy level for each star, but comparing the two stars.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the same energy level in both stars. So, the number of atoms in that level is 2 times higher in star_1 than in star_2. But how does that relate to temperature? Because for each star, the population of that level is determined by the partition function.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor for a specific energy level is n_i = (g_i / g_j) * n_j * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming that the ground state is j, then n_i = n_j * exp( -E_i/(k T) ), but that's only if E_j is zero, which it isn't necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the ratio between two different energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the question is that for each star, the number of iron atoms in the excited state (E2) is twice the number in the ground state (E1). So, for star 1, n2 / n1 = 2, and for star 2, n2' / n1' = 1. Then, using the Boltzmann equation, for each star, 2 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) ), and 1 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) ). But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps for star_1, n_upper / n_lower = 2, and for star_2, n_upper / n_lower = 1. So, the ratio for star_1 is 2, star_2 is 1. Then, using the Boltzmann equation, we can set up the equations.

So, for star 1: 2 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) )

For star 2: 1 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

Taking natural logs:

ln(2) = - delta E/(k T1 )

ln(1) = 0 = - delta E/(k T2 )

Wait, but ln(1) is zero, so delta E/(k T2) = 0, which would imply T2 is infinite, which doesn't make sense. So that approach is probably wrong.

Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the initial condition. Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, perhaps the specific energy level refers to the same level in both stars. So, the population in that level is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. But in that case, how do we relate the temperatures?

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the same energy level, but the ratio of the excited atoms to the total number of atoms is twice as high in star_1.

Wait, that might complicate things because the total number of atoms in the star's photosphere might vary, but perhaps it's assuming that the number of atoms is the same, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of the two populations. Let me define for each star the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n2) to those in the ground state (n1), which is the same for both stars in terms of the energy difference delta E.

So, for star 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

For star 2: n2_2 / n1_2 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But I'm not exactly sure what this "twice as excited" refers to. Maybe it's the ratio of n2 to n1. So, (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2 )

So,

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Taking natural log on both sides:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) + (- delta E/(k T2) )

Rearranging:

delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) = ln(2 )

Factor out delta E/(k):

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

So, [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = [ ln(2) * k ] / delta E

But wait, we can write this as:

[ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = [ ln(2) * k ] / delta E

But the question gives that delta E is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute [ ln(2) * k ] / delta E.

Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. So,

ln(2) * k = approx 0.693 * 1.38e-23 J/K = approx 0.956e-23 J/K.

Then, [ ln(2) * k ] / delta E = 0.956e-23 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 0.693.

So, it's about 0.693.

But the equation we have is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) *k ] / delta E ≈ 0.693.

But looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Option D says: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but our equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) *k ] / delta E

But delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k * (some temperature?), but maybe the question is assuming that [ ln(2) * k ] / delta E equals ln(2), which would happen if delta E = k.

Because delta E = k * T, assuming T is 1 K. But wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k=1.38e-23 J/K). So, delta E = k * T, where T is 1 K. So, delta E = k * T_x, with T_x=1 K.

So, substituting delta E = k * T_x, then [ ln(2)*k ] / (k T_x ) ) = ln(2)/ T_x.

So, our equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / T_x.

But since T_x is 1 K (from delta E = k * 1 K ), then:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct equation.

So the answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratio of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Assuming this refers to the population ratio of the excited state to the ground state, we set:

\[
\frac{n_2^{(1)}}{n_1^{(1)}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2^{(2)}}{n_1^{(2)}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

\[
\frac{n_2^{(1)}}{n_1^{(1)}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_2^{(2)}}{n_1^{(2)}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Substituting these into the population ratio equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E / k \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:
