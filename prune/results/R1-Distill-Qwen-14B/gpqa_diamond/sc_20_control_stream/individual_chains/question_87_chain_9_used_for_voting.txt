Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a specific compound. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbons. So, wait, wait. Let me think about that. A benzene ring is 6 carbons. If it's di-substituted, that means two substituents attached. But the total is 8 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons in total. Hmm, but each substituent is probably something like a methyl group (1 carbon) or an ethyl (2 carbons) or maybe a carbonyl group.

Oh, wait, the question says peaks in the FTIR indicate the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, two substituents on the benzene ring: one is a carbonyl (like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde?), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, no. The aromatic-halogen bond suggests that one substituent is a halogen. The other substituent has a carbonyl group. So, the structure must be a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the carbonyl group would be part of a substituent. For example, maybe an acyl group like an acetyl (COCH3) or maybe something else. Alternatively, if the substituent is a carbonyl like a ketone, perhaps a group like -CO-R.

But wait, the substituents add up to two carbons. Because the benzene has 6, and the total is 8, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Hmm, no, because 6 + 2 substituents (each 1 carbon) would make 8. But wait, the substituents could be different.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The molecule has a benzene ring (6 carbons). Two substituents: each substituent adds a certain number of carbons. The total for substituents is 8 - 6 = 2 carbons. So substituents together have 2 carbons. So perhaps one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which is zero carbons) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group with two carbons.

Wait, that can't be right. Because halogens don't add any carbons. So if substituents are, say, a Cl and a carbonyl group attached directly to the ring (like a ketone substituent, which is a carbonyl group without any additional carbons), then the substituents are Cl and O=C-R, but R would have to be something. Wait, maybe one substituent is a Cl (no carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon, like a ketone (so O=C-R where R is a CH3 group). That would make the substituent -COCH3, which has 2 carbons. So the substituents would add 2 carbons (from the acetyl group), and the Cl adds zero. So total would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) = 8.

Wait, but the substituents are two in number. So, if one substituent is Cl, that's 0 carbons, and the other is, say, a methyl ketone group (COCH3), which contributes 2 carbons (the methyl and the CO). So the substituents are Cl and COCH3, making total substituent carbons 2. That fits with the 8-carbon total.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: a Cl and a COCH3 group, each attached to adjacent carbons (since it's 1,2-disubstituted) or perhaps in another position.

Wait, but the question says di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. The substituents are a carbonyl group (so perhaps a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen.

But wait, the FTIR shows both a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a halogen (like Cl, Br) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group.

Now, the possible structures: the benzene ring has two substituents. One is Cl, the other is a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acetyl (COCH3). So the substituents would be at positions 1 and 2, or 1 and 3, etc. But the NMR spectrum would depend on the substitution pattern.

But the NMR options given are all different. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). 

Hmm, 9.9 ppm is a very deshielded proton. That could be an aldehyde proton (-CHO). But wait, in the substituent, if it's an acetyl group (COCH3), there's no aldehyde. So maybe this option suggests an aldehyde group. But earlier, I thought the substituent is COCH3, but if it's an aldehyde, that substituent would be a CHO group, which is one carbon. But earlier, the substituents need to add 2 carbons (since the total is 8). So if one substituent is Cl (0 C), the other is CHO (1 C), that's only 1, which doesn't reach 8. Hmm. Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says the compound has 8 carbons in total. So the benzene is 6, and substituents add 2. So substituents must account for 2 carbons: Cl is zero, so the other substituent must be a group with 2 carbons. So that group could be a COCH2CH3 (ethyl ketone), which is 3 carbons, but that's 3, which would make the total 6+3=9. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached via a carbonyl, like COCH3 (which is 2 carbons: the CO is part of the substituent, but the methyl is attached to the CO). So that substituent contributes 2 carbons (the methyl and the CO as part of the ring substituent). So substituents are Cl (0) and COCH3 (2), total 2. So 6+2=8.

Wait, but COCH3 is a ketone group. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So the substituents are -Cl and -COCH3.

Now, considering the positions. If they are adjacent (1,2-dichlorobenzene with a COCH3?), but more accurately, the positions could vary.

But let's think about the NMR. Let's consider the possible structures.

If the substituents are in the ortho, meta, or para positions.

But for NMR, the splitting and the number of protons would matter.

So for a benzene ring with two substituents, the aromatic protons would be split into different patterns depending on the substituents.

But let's think about the substituents: one is a strong deactivating group (Cl is ortho/para directing) and the other is a strong deactivating (COCH3 is also ortho/para directing). So the substituents would likely be in positions that allow for the most stable structure, perhaps para to each other, but the substituents could be in any of the allowed positions.

But let's think about the NMR options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). 

9.9 is a singlet. That's a very downfield proton. An aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm and is a singlet if there's no neighboring protons. But in our case, the substituent is COCH3, which would not have an aldehyde proton. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). 

These are around 4.8 and 4.6, which are more typical for protons near electronegative atoms, like O or N. The 1.3 (3H, s) could be a methyl group attached to something, like an oxygen. But this doesn't seem to fit with a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3. Because in that case, the other signals would be aromatic protons. So this option probably isn't correct.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). 

The 7.8 and 7.6 are typical for aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons, maybe in a para-substituted scenario. The 2.3 (3H, s) would be a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something that deshields it, like a carbonyl. So that fits with the COCH3 group. So in this case, the NMR would have two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group attached to CO.

So if the benzene ring has substituents that are Cl and COCH3, and the substitution is para, the aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets. Wait, but in para substitution with two strong deactivating groups, how many aromatic protons would there be?

Wait, no, wait. Suppose the benzene has substituents at para positions. Let's say substituent A is Cl at position 1, and substituent B is COCH3 at position 3 (wait, no, para is position 4). Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Let's say benzene is numbered such that substituent X is at position 1 and substituent Y is at position 3. Wait, but di-substituted can be in any positions. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para position (positions 1 and 4), then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other.

But in that case, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent as well. So in the NMR, you would see two doublets (for the two sets), each integrating to 2H each. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that fits.

The 2.3 ppm would be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3). So the singlet because the methyl group is attached to the carbonyl, which is a symmetric environment, so all three protons are equivalent and don't have neighboring protons to split them.

So option C fits the scenario where the substituents are para to each other, a Cl and a COCH3 group.

But wait, let me think again. If substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would have a certain splitting pattern. Alternatively, if they are meta, the pattern might be different.

But the substituents are both strong deactivating, meta directors. So perhaps the substituents are in the meta positions.

Wait, but the substituents are Cl and COCH3. Cl is an ortho/para director, and COCH3 is also an ortho/para director. So their positions would be determined by their directing effects.

Wait, but when there are two substituents, the more activating one would dominate, but in this case, both are deactivating. So the substituents would be placed according to their combined directing. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to focus on the NMR options. Let's see.

Option C: the aromatic protons are in two doublets (each 2H) and the methyl group at 2.3 ppm. So that would support a para-substituted benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4, but then the substituents might be Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but if substituent X is Cl at position 1 and substituent Y is COCH3 at position 4, then the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and perhaps upfield or downfield depending on substituent. Similarly, the protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded.

But in any case, the NMR would show two sets of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches option C. So option C's NMR would have those signals.

Now, the other options:

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). 

The 6.9 (1H, s) is an aromatic proton, which is a singlet. That suggests that the aromatic ring has only one proton, which would be the case if three substituents were present, but in this problem, it's di-substituted. So perhaps this option doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. No, di-substituted benzene has four aromatic protons. So how can option D have a singlet for 1H? Perhaps if the substituents are in such a way that two of the aromatic protons are equivalent and split into a singlet, but that's unlikely. So probably, option D isn't the correct one.

So putting it all together: the correct NMR should show aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H) and a singlet for the methyl group of the COCH3 substituent.

Looking back, option C has exactly that: the two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. So option C seems correct.

Wait, but why is the chemical shift for the methyl group at 2.3? The COCH3 group's methyl is typically around 2.1-2.3 ppm, so that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbons. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH₃). This fits the total of 2 carbons contributed by the substituents.

The structure is likely a benzene ring with a Cl atom and a COCH₃ group as substituents. The substituents are strong deactivating groups and ortho/para directors, so they are likely positioned para to each other. This substitution pattern results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each appearing as a doublet in the NMR spectrum. The COCH₃ group contributes a singlet for its methyl protons (3H) at ~2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a peak at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the substituent is COCH₃, not CHO, making this option incorrect.
- **Option B**: Contains peaks in the ~4.8–4.6 ppm range, typical for protons near electronegative atoms, but lacks aromatic protons, which are expected for a benzene ring. This option is inconsistent with the compound.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), consistent with the COCH₃ group. This matches the expected NMR pattern for a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH₃.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm for 1H, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring, as it would have four aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, which aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and COCH₃ as substituents.

That would make the substituent -COCH3, which has 2 carbons. So the substituents would add 2 carbons (from the acetyl group), and the Cl adds zero. So total would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) = 8.

Wait, but the substituents are two in number. So, if one substituent is Cl, that's 0 carbons, and the other is, say, a methyl ketone group (COCH3), which contributes 2 carbons (the methyl and the CO).

So substituents must account for 2 carbons: Cl is zero, so the other substituent must be a group with 2 carbons.

So that substituent contributes 2 carbons (the methyl and the CO as part of the ring substituent). So substituents are Cl (0) and COCH3 (2), total 2. So 6+2=8.

Wait, but COCH3 is a ketone group. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So the substituents are -Cl and -COCH3.

Now, considering the positions. If they are adjacent (1,2-dichlorobenzene with a COCH3?), but more accurately, the positions could vary.

9.9 is a singlet. That's a very downfield proton. An aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm and is a singlet if there's no neighboring protons. But in our case, the substituent is COCH3, which would not have an aldehyde proton. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). 

These are around 4.8 and 4.6, which are more typical for protons near electronegative atoms, like O or N. The 1.3 (3H, s) could be a methyl group attached to something, like an oxygen. But this doesn't seem to fit with a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3. Because in that case, the other signals would be aromatic protons. So this option probably isn't correct.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). 

The 7.8 and 7.6 are typical for aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons, maybe in a para-substituted scenario. The 2.3 (3H, s) would be a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something that deshields it, like a carbonyl. So that fits with the COCH3 group. So in this case, the NMR would have two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group attached to CO.

So if the benzene ring has substituents that are Cl and COCH3, and the substitution is para, the aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets. Wait, but in para substitution with two strong deactivating groups, how many aromatic protons would there be?

Wait, no, wait. Suppose the benzene has substituents at para positions. Let's say substituent A is Cl at position 1, and substituent B is COCH3 at position 3 (wait, no, para is position 4). Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused here.

So in the NMR, you would see two doublets (for the two sets), each integrating to 2H each. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that fits.

The 2.3 ppm would be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3). So the singlet because the methyl group is attached to the carbonyl, which is a symmetric environment, so all three protons are equivalent and don't have neighboring protons to split them.

Similarly, the protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded.

But in any case, the NMR would show two sets of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches option C. So option C's NMR would have those signals.

Now, the other options:

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). 

The 6.9 (1H, s) is an aromatic proton, which is a singlet. That suggests that the aromatic ring has only one proton, which would be the case if three substituents were present, but in this problem, it's di-substituted. So perhaps this option doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. No, di-substituted benzene has four aromatic protons. So how can option D have a singlet for 1H? Perhaps if the substituents are in such a way that two of the aromatic protons are equivalent and split into a singlet, but that's unlikely. So probably, option D isn't the correct one.

So putting it all together: the correct NMR should show aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H) and a singlet for the methyl group of the COCH3 substituent.

Looking back, option C has exactly that: the two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. So option C seems correct.

Wait, but why is the chemical shift for the methyl group at 2.3? The COCH3 group's methyl is typically around 2.1-2.3 ppm, so that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, which aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and COCH₃ as substituents.

Answer: C
