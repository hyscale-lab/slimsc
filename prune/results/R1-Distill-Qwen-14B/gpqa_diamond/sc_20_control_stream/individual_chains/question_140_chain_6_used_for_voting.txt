Hmm, okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

So the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's just a bit above freezing, so maybe it's a solid that's near its melting point under normal conditions.

Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Plus, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me break this down. Let's start with the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction usually makes me think of something reactive, like an acid reacting with a metal. But Y is a liquid, so maybe it's an acid like sulfuric or hydrochloric? Wait, but liquid Y is reacting with X to produce gas W.

Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, each molecule? So each molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, but that has 1 proton each, and no neutrons. So total protons (2) and neutrons (0) don't match. So that's out.

What about carbon dioxide? No, that's CO2, but that's a linear molecule. Wait, but each CO2 molecule has 12 protons (C) and 16*2=32 oxygen protons. Wait, no, the molecule itself: each CO2 has 1 C (6 protons), 2 O (8 each). So total protons in molecule: 6 + 16 = 22. Neutrons in CO2 molecule would be the sum of the neutrons in C and O. Carbon is usually C-12 (6 neutrons), O is O-16 (8). So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait, so 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So CO2 would fit. But wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, another possibility: H2O. Each molecule has 2 H (each has 1 p, 0 n) and one O (8 p, 8 n). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. So 10 p, 8 n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe CH4? Each molecule: C has 6 p, H has 1 each. So 6 +4=10 p. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12) and H has 0. So 6 +0=6. 10 p, 6 n. Not equal.

Wait another candidate: NH3. Each molecule: N has 7 p, H has 1 each. So 7 +3=10 p. Neutrons: N (7-7=0? Wait, wait. No, wait, N-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So for each NH3 molecule, N has 7 p and 7 n, each H has 1 p and 0 n. So total p:7+3=10, total n:7+0=7. Not equal.

Wait, maybe CO. Carbon has 6 p, 6 n (if C-12), O has 8 p, 6 n (if O-14? No, wait, O is usually O-16, which has 8 n. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the molecule itself: the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons in the molecule.

So for a molecule, sum all the protons of each atom equals sum of all neutrons.

So for example, if it's a diatomic molecule, maybe H2. H2 has 2 H atoms, each with 1 p. So total protons = 2. Each H has 0 neutrons, so total neutrons = 0. Not equal.

What about O2? Each O is 8 p, 8 n (if O-16). So each O2 molecule has 16 p and 16 n. So 16 each. That works. So O2 would fit. Another possibility: N2. Each N has 7 p and 7 n (if N-14). So N2 has 14 p and 14 n. Also fits.

Alternatively, maybe CO2 as I thought earlier. C has 6 p, 6 n; O has 8 p, 8 n each. So CO2: 6 + 8*2 =22 p. 6 +8*2 =22 n. So yes, 22 each. So CO2 would fit.

But wait, gas W is released. So what reactions produce O2, N2, or CO2? Let me think about the reaction of X with Y.

If X is a metal, perhaps reacting with an acid (liquid Y). For example, Mg reacting with HCl. The reaction would produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. So 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid that's just above its melting point. Hmm, what's a substance that melts around there?

Wait, the melting point of water is 273 K, which is 0°C. So 277 K is a bit higher, maybe something like ice? But if G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B, which is maybe water?

Wait, another thought: maybe G is a carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into CO2 and something else. For instance, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) upon heating would produce CaO and CO2. But the melting point of CaO is much higher than 277 K. Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate? Like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes upon heating to give CO2, Na2CO3, and H2O. But the melting point of B would then be water. But water's melting point is 273 K, and 277 is a bit higher, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is sodium, Y is water, but that might not fit. Alternatively, think about a metal reacting with water to form a hydroxide and H2 gas. But the gas W would be H2, which doesn't fit the neutron-proton condition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a metal oxide with an acid. For example, if X is a metal oxide, and Y is an acid, like H2SO4. The reaction would produce water as a gas? But water is a liquid under standard conditions, so that's not gas W.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G upon heating releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. So if B is a solid, maybe it's a type of ice? Or perhaps something like dry ice, which is CO2 solid. But dry ice sublimes at lower temps. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's a carbonate or bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, let's consider the gas W. If it's CO2, then the reaction between X and Y releases CO2. So what reactions produce CO2? Combustion, decomposition of carbonates, or maybe oxidation of a carbonate.

Wait, suppose X is a carbonate. When it reacts with an acid, Y, perhaps HCl, it might produce CO2. For example: CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. So gas W would be CO2, which fits the condition (22 p and 22 n per molecule). Then, precipitate G would be CaCl2, but that's soluble in water. Hmm, no, that's not a precipitate. So perhaps Y isn't an acid but something else.

Wait, another angle: if X is a metal, and Y is a liquid that's an acid, then the reaction could produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit, so perhaps X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is an isotope-rich substance. The first part says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X could be something like Cl, which has a heavy isotope, perhaps Cl-35 vs Cl-37.

Wait, let's think about the keto acid part. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, perhaps X is a base. In organic chemistry, a common base is something like NaOH, KOH, or another hydroxide. Wait, but if X is a hydroxide, like NaOH, it could react with a keto acid. For example, a keto acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) would react with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+), water, etc. But what's the product in terms of oxygen count?

Wait, the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe X is a dehydrating agent? Or perhaps it's a strong base like KOH.

Alternatively, X could be something like D2O (deuterated water), but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought: in the reaction with a keto acid, X could be a strong base like NaOH. The reaction would neutralize the acid, forming a salt. The product would have certain oxygen atoms. But the question says the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. Wait, maybe the product is something like CH3COO-R, where R is from X. But I'm not sure.

Let me go back to the reaction between X and Y. If W is CO2, then Y is an acid that can produce CO2 when reacting with X. For example, X could be a carbonate. If X is Na2CO3, and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce CO2. Then, precipitate G would need to form. Wait, but Na2CO3 is soluble in HCl, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: X is a hydroxide, Y is an acid. For example, X is NaOH, Y is H2SO4. The reaction would be: 2 NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O. So gas W would be H2O, but that's a liquid. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitric acid. Then, X could be a metal. Let's say X is copper, which reacts with nitric acid to produce NO or NO2 gas. But I don't think NO or NO2 fit the neutron-proton condition.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B. If B's melting point is near 277 K, which is 4°C, perhaps B is a solid like water ice. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it releases CO2 and forms a metal oxide. For instance, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. Then B would be CaO. But CaO's melting point is much higher than 277 K.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the elements in X. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X has at least two elements. The lightest and heaviest in X.

If X is a diatomic molecule, or perhaps a compound with multiple elements.

Wait, the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. One such reagent is D2O, which is heavy water. Or maybe something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that's more of a solvent.

Wait another thought: X is perhaps a halogen, but more likely, maybe it's a strong base. Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. But how would that fit into the other parts?

Wait, let me think about the part where X reacts with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming a salt. For example, if the keto acid is something like propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), then reacting with NaOH would produce CH2CH2COO-Na+ and water. The product would have more oxygen atoms, but the question says 2. Hmm, maybe it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O, heavy water. If a keto acid reacts with D2O, perhaps in a process like deuteration. But I'm not sure about the products.

Wait, another angle: the gas W's molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. So another candidate is CH4. Wait, no, earlier we saw that didn't fit. Wait, let me recalculate.

CH4: Each molecule has 1 C (6 p, 6 n) and 4 H (1 p, 0 n each). So total p:6 +4=10. Total n:6 +0=6. Not equal. So no.

Wait, another possibility: CO. Let's see: C has 6 p, 8 n (if it's C-14? No, normally C is C-12, which is 6 p, 6 n). O has 8 p, 8 n (O-16). So CO has 6+8=14 p. 6+8=14 n. Hey, that adds up! So gas W could be CO. So each CO molecule has 14 p and 14 n.

So if gas W is CO, then what reactions produce CO? Maybe the decomposition of a carbonate, but more likely, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a weak acid, producing CO. Or perhaps, the reaction between a carbonate and an acid could produce CO2, but earlier I thought W is CO2.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong. Let's consider W as CO. So when X reacts with Y, CO is released. What reactions produce CO?

Wait, another thought: if Y is a liquid acid, perhaps HCl, and X is a metal. The reaction of some metals with HCl can produce HCl gas, but I'm not sure about CO.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture, like a solution of something. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbon-containing compound.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. For example, CaCO3 reacts with HCl to produce CO2, but that's the same as earlier. So if W is CO2, which fits, then perhaps the initial assumption is correct.

But then, what about the precipitate G? If X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the product would be CaCl2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps X is a sulfite. When a sulfite reacts with an acid, it produces SO2 gas. But SO2 has 32 p (S:16, O:16) and 32 n (S:16, O:16). So that would fit as well. Wait, each SO2 molecule has 16+16=32 p, and 16 (from S) + 16 (from O) *2=48 n. No, that doesn't match. Wait, S has 16 p and 16 n (if S-32), O has 8 p and 8 n (O-16). So each SO2 molecule: 16*1 +8*2 =32 p. Neutrons:16 + 8*2=32. So 32 p and 32 n. That fits! So gas W could be SO2.

But then, what reaction would produce SO2? It's usually produced in reactions where sulfites or sulfides react with acids. For example, Na2SO3 + HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + SO2↑.

In that case, the precipitate G would be NaCl, which is soluble, so no. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, but reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas, which doesn't fit.

Wait, getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X has 2 oxygen atoms. So let's think about keto acids. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) or something similar.

If X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, the product would be a salt. For instance, if the keto acid is CH3COCH2COOH and X is NaOH, the product would be CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+.

But the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the acid itself has more oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. Wait, maybe X is a dehydrating agent like P2O5 or H2SO4.

Wait, another possibility: X is D2O (deuterium oxide), heavy water. So when a keto acid reacts with D2O, perhaps in a process called deuteration, replacing H with D. But how would that product look? The product would have some D atoms, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count.

Alternatively, the reaction of a keto acid with X could be a neutralization. The product would be a salt, like RCOO^- X^+. For example, if the acid is RCOOH, and X is NaOH, the product is RCOO-Na+.

The product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, the acid (RCOOH) has two oxygen atoms in the COOH group. If X is a base like NaOH, the product would have more oxygens. Hmm, maybe the product is something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an esterification. For example, a keto acid could react with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong oxidizing agent. Or maybe it's involved in an elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms in a different position. Maybe the product is an ester, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

Gas W is CO2 or SO2, each of which would fit the neutron-proton condition. The reaction between X and Y produces this gas and a precipitate G. Then, heating G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K.

If W is CO2, perhaps Y is HCl and X is a carbonate. But the precipitate wouldn't form. Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate.

Wait, another angle: when a carbonate is heated, it doesn't decompose unless it's a very strong heat. Maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a hydroxide, like NaOH, and Y is an acid, but the reaction would produce water and a salt. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, Y is water, and the reaction produces H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Another thought: what if Y is a solution of sodium hydroxide, and X is a salt that reacts to produce a precipitate. For example, AgNO3 reacting with NaOH would produce AgOH as a precipitate, which upon heating would decompose into AgO and H2O. But I'm not sure if the melting point matches.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, Y is dilute acid. Then, the reaction would produce H2S gas, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacting with water would produce NH3 gas. But NH3's molecule has 14 p (7 from N and 3 from H) and 7 n (N has 7 n, H has none). So 14 p, 7 n. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces N2 gas. Each N2 molecule has 14 p and 14 n. So that fits. So W is N2.

If that's the case, what reaction produces N2? Maybe the decomposition of a nitride or the reaction of a metal with a very strong oxidizing acid. For example, Mg reacts with HNO3 to produce NO or N2O, but not N2. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of a metal like Na with a very concentrated acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a liquid acid. For example, Zn reacting with HNO3 to produce NO, but that's not N2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metalloid and acid, but I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should focus on the other parts. The substance X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent. One common reagent is D2O, heavy water. Another is THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that's a solvent. Alternatively, maybe it's something like NaOH, which is used in many reactions, including saponification of esters.

Wait, X incorporates a heavier isotope. So if X is H2O, a heavier isotope would be D2O. Or maybe it's something else, like CHCl3 with a heavier Cl isotope.

Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps one of the elements in X has a heavy isotope. For example, if X is H2O, and it's deuterium oxide (D2O), then H is replaced by D, which is a heavier isotope.

So if X is D2O, then it's a heavy water. Let's see how that fits into other parts.

So D2O (X) reacts with Y, a liquid. What would Y be? Maybe a strong acid like HCl. The reaction between D2O and HCl: D2O + HCl → HCl + D2 (maybe). Wait, but I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, D2O could be used as a solvent, but I'm not sure about the violent reaction.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal. For example, Na reacting with D2O to produce D2 gas. 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + D2↑. So the gas W would be D2. Each D2 molecule has 2 D atoms. Each D has 1 p and 1 n. So each molecule has 2 p and 2 n. That fits the condition. So W is D2.

Then, the precipitate G would be NaOD, perhaps. But when heated, NaOD would decompose? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of X (D2O) with a metal like Na produces NaOD and D2. Then, precipitate G might be NaOD. Heating NaOD might not release anything, unless it decomposes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that when G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is near 277 K. So perhaps B is something like water ice. But if X is D2O, then B would be D2O? But D2O's melting point is around the same as H2O.

Alternatively, if X is D2O and Y is something else. Maybe Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with D2O to form a precipitate. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think again.

Another possibility: X is a mixture of H2O and a heavy isotope, but that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. That's close to 4°C. So perhaps B is a solid that's just above freezing. Maybe B is something like ice, but then G would have to be a hydrate.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate or bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the product of the reaction with a keto acid. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's imagine that the product is a simple molecule, perhaps with two O atoms.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration. For example, the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (HOOC-CH2-OH), and X is a dehydrating agent like P2O5. The reaction would form an anhydride, which might have fewer oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone and water. For example, if the keto acid loses a water molecule to form a ketone. But then the product (the ketone) would have more oxygen atoms, I think.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this part, so perhaps I should think about the possible options for the cumulative atomic masses.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These sum to certain values. Let's consider what elements could sum to these.

Assuming X has two elements, the lightest and heaviest.

For example, if X is H2O, then lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

If X is NaOH, elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H, heaviest Na. Sum is 24, which is option B (25 is close but not exactly). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is CH3OH (methanol). Elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, X could be something like NH3. Elements N (14), H (1). Lightest H, heaviest N. Sum 15. Not in options.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a compound with two heavy isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37. But X would have Cl as the heaviest and something else as the lightest.

Wait, if X is Cl2, then the lightest element is Cl (35 or 37), but it's a single element. So perhaps X has two different elements.

Wait, if X is a compound with two elements, like CO2. Then elements C (12) and O (16). Sum lightest (C) and heaviest (O): 12 +16=28. Not an option. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Suppose X is a diatomic molecule, like H2, but that's only one element. So it's not applicable.

Wait, maybe X is something like NaCl. Then, elements Na (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 23 +35.5=58.5. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of the keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think of a simple product. Maybe the product is a diethyl ether or something, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, the product could be something like an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if the keto acid loses water to form a ketone. So, for instance, if the keto acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), and X is a dehydrating agent like H2SO4, the product would be propanone (CH3COCH3), which has three oxygen atoms in the acid but after dehydration, the product has only one O? No, wait, propanone is (CH3)2CO, which has one O. So the product has one O, but the question says two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an aldehyde. For example, if the keto acid is something that upon reaction with X (like a base) loses CO2, but that would have fewer O's.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think of possible answers.

The options are 25,29,31,35.

Which sums could correspond to two elements.

25: Maybe 12 (C) +13 (Al). Or 15 (N) +10 (Ne?) No, elements don't have 10. Or 1 (H) +24 (Cr). Hmm, Cr is 52. Not matching.

29: Maybe 1 (H) +28 (Si). 1+28=29. Yes, option D is 29.

31: 16 (O) +15 (P)=31. So option C is 31.

35: 14 (N) +21 (Sc)=35. But Sc is rare. Or 12 (C) +23 (Na)=35. Option A is 35.

Wait, but what if X is a compound of Na and O? Like Na2O. Then, elements are Na (23) and O (16). Sum is 39. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if X has H and O, sum 1+16=17. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: if X is a compound containing C and O. For example, CO. Then sum is 12 +16=28. Not an option.

Hmm. Let me think of the possible substances X. The problem says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. One such reagent is NaOH, which is used in many reactions, including saponification. So if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. But the options don't have 24.

Alternatively, X could be something with heavier elements. Wait, another reagent is concentrated H2SO4, which is used as a dehydrating agent. So if X is H2SO4, the elements are H, S, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest S (32.07). Sum is 1 +32.07≈33. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: the question says that the cumulative atomic masses are to be summed. So if X has multiple isotopes, but the question says if multiple instances of an element exist, sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes.

Wait, perhaps X is something like D2O, which has H (deuterium, 2) and O (16). So the lightest element would be O (16), heaviest is H (2). Wait, no. The lightest element would be the element with the smaller atomic number. So H is lighter than O. So sum is 2 (D) +16=18. Not an option.

Wait, but if X is a compound with two elements, say, Na and Cl. Na is 23, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 58.5. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I've been approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible answers and see which could fit.

Option D is 29. Which could be H (1) and Si (28). So sum 29.

If X is a compound with H and Si, perhaps something like SiH4. Then, the reaction could be with an acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, X could be NaF. But that's not a common reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's imagine that X is a metal, and the product is a salt. For example, the keto acid is HOOCCOOH (tartaric acid), and X is NaOH. The product would be Na2(HOOCCOO)O. But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure about the oxygen count.

Wait, maybe the product is a simple ester. For example, the keto acid could be ethyl acetoacetate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a neutralization, and the product is a salt with formula RCOO-M+, where M is from X. The product would have two oxygen atoms in the COO group. So maybe R is a methyl group, making the product CH3COO-M+. That has two oxygen atoms in the COO group. So the product has two O atoms.

If that's the case, then X is a metal like Li, Na, K, etc. So X would be LiOH, NaOH, KOH, etc. Then, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product is a corresponding salt with two O atoms in the COO group.

So X could be NaOH, which is used in organic chemistry as a base. Now, NaOH's elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Hmm, but the options don't include 24. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal hydride. For example, LiAlH4. But that's more of a strong reducing agent. The product of reacting it with a keto acid would be a salt with more O's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), but that's a solvent, not a reagent. Alternatively, DMF (dimethylformamide), but again, more of a solvent.

Wait, another thought: the substance X is a halogen, like Cl2. If Cl2 reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps NaOH. The reaction would produce Cl- and NaCl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is Cl2, and Y is a solution of NaOH. The reaction would produce Cl2 gas? No, Cl2 wouldn't be produced.

Alternatively, perhaps X is O2, but that's a gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the gas W. Since W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, and the options for the sum are 25,29,31,35, perhaps the sum relates to the isotopes.

Wait, another possibility: the gas W is CO. So each CO molecule has 14 p and 14 n. So that fits.

If W is CO, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO gas. What reaction produces CO?

Perhaps the reaction between a carbonate and a weak acid. For example, Na2CO3 + HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2↑. But we already considered that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between a sulfite and an acid produces SO2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a hydroxide and a carbonyl compound. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonyl, but that's getting too complicated.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the possible elements in X that would sum their lightest and heaviest to the options given.

If the answer is option C (31), that would be 16 (O) +15 (P). So X would have O and P. Or 12 (C) +19 (K)=31. Hmm, K is 39, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another combination: 14 (N) + 17 (Cl)=31. So if X has N and Cl, sum is 31. So option C is 31.

So, X could be NH4Cl. But NH4Cl is a salt. When it reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps water? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like CH3Cl, but that's a chlorinated compound. The product with a keto acid? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like PCl3. Then, reacting with Y (maybe water) would produce HCl and H3PO3, releasing HCl gas. But HCl has 18 p (1 from H, 17 from Cl) and 17 n (Cl has 18-17=1 n). So 18 p and 17 n. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another approach: the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 35,25,31,29.

If X is something like KNO3, then the elements are K (39), N (14), O (16). The lightest element is N (14), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 53. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, X could be a compound with elements like C and Cl. Then sum would be 12 +35=47. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CCl2F2 (dichlorofluoromethane), but that's used in refrigerants, not as a reagent.

Another thought: the product of the keto acid and X has 2 O atoms. So perhaps it's a simple ester. For example, the product is RCOOR', which has two O atoms in the ester group. So if X is an alcohol, like R'OH, then the reaction would be esterification. For example, RCOOH + R'OH → RCOOR' + H2O.

In that case, X is R'OH, which is an alcohol. But is R'OH used as a reagent in organic chemistry? Yes, alcohols are used in reactions like esterifications. But would the product have two O atoms? The ester group has two O atoms, yes.

So if X is an alcohol, like ethanol (C2H5OH), then the elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O. Sum is 17, not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, if X is a diol or something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a deuterated alcohol, like CD3OD. Then, the elements are C (12), D (2), O (16). Lightest element is D (2), heaviest O (16). Sum is 18, not an option.

I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible options again.

If the correct answer is option C)31, which is 12+19=31 (C and K), but K is 39, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, 15 (P) +16 (O)=31. So if X has P and O, like in POCl3 or something. But what would that compound be used for?

Alternatively, if X is HPO3 (hypophosphorous acid), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, X could be something with C and S, but their sum is 12+32=44. Not matching.

Alternatively, X could be a compound with C and O, like CO, but sum is 28.

Wait, another thought: the sum of lightest and heaviest is 25. So possible combinations: 1 (H) +24 (Cr)=25. But Cr is 52. Doesn't fit. Or 14 (N) +11 (Na)=25. Na is 23, so 14+23=37, not 25.

Wait, another possibility: 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. So if X has C and Al, sum is 25 (option B is 25). So X could be something like Al2(CO3)3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing C and Al, but that's not a common reagent.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X with Y produces gas W, which is CO2. So X could be a carbonate. Then, the elements in X would include C and O.

Wait, if X is Na2CO3, elements are Na, C, O. The lightest element is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

Wait, that makes sense. So sum is 12 (C) +23 (Na)=35.

So option A is 35.

But earlier, when I thought about X as Na2CO3, the precipitate would be NaCl if Y is HCl, which is soluble, so that's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, and X is Na2CO3. The reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate and NaNO3. Then, gas W would be CO2, which fits. Then, precipitate G is BaCO3, which when heated decomposes into BaO and CO2. Then, B would be BaO, but BaO's melting point is much higher than 277 K. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. Then, X is Na2CO3, reaction produces Ag2CO3 as precipitate, which might decompose upon heating. But I'm not certain about the melting point.

Wait, another thought: if X is Na2CO3, and Y is a solution of Ca(NO3)2. Then, the reaction produces CaCO3 precipitate and NaNO3. CaCO3 decomposes upon heating to CaO and CO2. Then, B would be CaO. But CaO's melting point is around 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different solution. Let me think again.

If X is Na2CO3, and Y is a solution of CuSO4, then the reaction would produce CuCO3 (if possible) as precipitate, but I'm not sure if CuCO3 is stable.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is NaCl, but that's soluble.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of lead nitrate. Then, the reaction with Na2CO3 would produce PbCO3 precipitate. Heating PbCO3 would decompose into PbO and CO2. Then, B is PbO, which has a melting point higher than 277 K.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. Reacting with Y (maybe HCl), produces CO2, NaCl, and H2O. Then, gas W is CO2. Precipitate would be NaCl, which is soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of Ca(OH)2. Then, X is Na2CO3 would react to form CaCO3 precipitate and NaOH. Then, heating CaCO3 would produce CaO and CO2. B would be CaO, whose melting point is high, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is Na2CO3. The reaction produces Ag2CO3, which is a precipitate. Upon heating, Ag2CO3 decomposes into 2 Ag + CO2. Then, B would be Ag, which is a metal. The melting point of Ag is around 961°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the possible substances X that fit the other conditions.

The substance X is used in organic chemistry. One such reagent is concentrated H2SO4, which is used as a dehydrating agent. So if X is H2SO4, the elements are H, S, O.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is S (32). Sum is 33, which isn't an option. So that's out.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal, like Mg. It reacts with an acid Y to produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Alternatively, X is Fe, which reacts with an acid to produce H2. Again, same issue.

Wait, perhaps W is CO gas. So the reaction produces CO. How?

If X is FeO and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce FeCl2, H2O, and no CO. Not helpful.

Wait, another thought: the decomposition of a metal carbonate. For example, 2 MgCO3 → 2 MgO + CO2↑. But that produces CO2, not CO.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a weak acid, producing H2. But that doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbide, like CaC2. Reacting with water would produce acetylene gas (C2H2), but that doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, another possibility: W is Xe, but that's a noble gas and doesn't fit the neutron-proton condition.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the earlier analysis, if X is Na2CO3, the sum of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) is 12 +23=35, which is option A. But the precipitate issue remains unresolved.

Alternatively, if X is something else, like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid, not a reagent in the way described.

Wait, another thought: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. If X is a base like LiOH, the product would be the conjugate base. For example, RCOOH + LiOH → RCOOLi + H2O. The product (RCOOLi) has two oxygen atoms in the COO group. So that fits.

So if X is LiOH, the elements are Li (7), O (16), H (1). The lightest element is H (1), heaviest Li (7). Sum is 8, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. Elements Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is KOH. Elements K (39), O (16), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest K (39). Sum 40. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on earlier analysis, if X is Na2CO3, the sum is 35, which is option A. But I'm not entirely confident about the precipitate part. Alternatively, if X is a compound with C and O, like CO, sum is 28, not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)31, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction with the keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. So if the product is something like CH3COO-R, then R could be from X.

If X is a metal, R would be the metal. For example, if X is Na, then the product is CH3COO-Na+. That has two oxygen atoms in the COO group. So that fits.

So X could be Na. Then, the elements in X are Na (23). But X is a single element, so the lightest and heaviest are the same, sum is 23. Not an option.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option C)31, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, option A)35 could be correct if X is Na2CO3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with Liquid Y to release Gas W. Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A precipitate G forms, which releases B upon heating, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates for W include CO (14 p, 14 n) or CO2 (22 p, 22 n). These gases fit the condition and are consistent with reactions involving carbonates or acids.

2. **Reaction Between X and Y**: If X is a carbonate (e.g., Na2CO3) and Y is an acid (e.g., HCl), the reaction produces CO2 gas and a precipitate. However, common carbonates like Na2CO3 produce soluble salts (e.g., NaCl), which contradicts the formation of a precipitate. This suggests X may not be a carbonate but another compound.

3. **Precipitate G and Heating**: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point near 277 K (4°C) suggests it could be a solid like ice or a related compound. If G is a hydroxide or carbonate, heating might release CO2 or water, but this does not fully align with the melting point condition.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a base like NaOH, which reacts with a keto acid to form a salt (e.g., RCOO-Na+). However, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in NaOH (H: 1, Na: 23) sum to 24, which is not an option.

5. **Isotope Incorporation**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. This aligns with compounds like heavy water (D2O) or isotopically enriched substances. However, D2O's reaction with acids typically produces D2 gas, which does not fit the protons-neutrons condition for W.

6. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35. These sums suggest combinations of light and heavy elements. For example:
   - **Option A (35)**: C (12) + Na (23) = 35. This fits if X is Na2CO3, where the lightest element is C and the heaviest is Na. However, Na2CO3's reaction with acids typically produces soluble salts, contradicting the formation of a precipitate.
   - **Option C (31)**: P (15) + O (16) = 31. This fits if X contains P and O, but no clear candidate for X aligns with the reaction conditions.
   - **Option B (25)**: H (1) + Cr (24) = 25. This is unlikely as Cr is not common in organic reagents.
   - **Option D (29)**: H (1) + Si (28) = 29. This is also unlikely as Si is not a typical component of X in the given context.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible scenario is that X is Na2CO3, where the lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is Na (23), giving a cumulative sum of 35. While the precipitate issue remains unresolved, this aligns with the isotope incorporation and the reaction conditions.
