Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. I remember SMEFT is about Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? It's when you look at the Standard Model at energies below the electroweak scale but using higher-dimensional operators. But wait, the question is about symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect. Hmm.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, CP, and CPT. So let me think about each one. 

Lorentz symmetry: Well, I think SMEFT is built in a way that maintains Lorentz symmetry. Because the operators are constructed from the Standard Model fields and their covariant derivatives, which respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT should preserve Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely correct.

Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, SMEFT is a effective theory, so it's defined in a certain approximation, and it's usually taken to be Lorentz invariant. But does it have to respect Poincare? Or is Poincare automatically included when you have a Lorentz invariant theory? Because Poincare includes translations, which are about moving in space-time. SMEFT is a field theory, so it's required to have Poincare symmetry. Oh wait, but in effective field theories, you can have operators that break Poincare? No, I don't think so. Because the operators are local, so the whole theory must respect Poincare. Or do I have that wrong? Like, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed from SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So probably, SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry as well. So 2 is correct.

Next is CP symmetry. I remember that the SM has CP symmetry, but it's not always exactly respected. For example, in the electroweak theory, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. But SMEFT includes all possible higher-dimensional operators, some of which might violate CP. Or wait, no—do the operators have to respect certain symmetries? Or can they violate them? Because SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible interactions allowed by the SM's symmetries. Wait, no, the operators are constructed respecting the SM gauge symmetries but may have different transformation properties otherwise. So for example, some operators might be even under CP, others might be odd. So the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry necessarily. Because in the SM, certain terms have CP violation. So in SMEFT, the operators can violate CP. So it's not a must that all SMEFT operators respect CP. So 3 is not necessarily correct, so 3 is out.

CPT symmetry: I remember that in any Lorentz invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because of the way the Lorentz group works and the properties of the S-matrix. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry (which it does), it must also respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? 1 (Lorentz) is yes. 2 (Poincare) is yes. 3 (CP) is no. 4 (CPT) is yes.

Wait, but I thought about Poincare. So Poincare is about the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since SMEFT is a field theory, which by definition has Poincare symmetry, all its operators must respect that. So 2 is correct. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, 4. So looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option C says 1,2,4.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed using Standard Model (SM) fields and their covariant derivatives, which respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry. This symmetry is mandatory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must preserve Poincaré symmetry. This symmetry is also mandatory.

3. **CP Symmetry**: While the SM respects CP symmetry in many cases, it also allows for CP violation (e.g., in the electroweak sector). SMEFT includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with SM gauge symmetries, which may or may not respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily preserved by all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. This symmetry is mandatory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).
