Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember from my QFT class that renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constants and the terms in the Lagrangian.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, σ is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the mass dimensions of each part of the term. Remember, in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian must be 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down each component.

The ψ̄ and ψ are Dirac spinors. Each Dirac spinor has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4D, the field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, and A is a vector potential with dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

Wait, but in this Lagrangian, the term is σ_{μν} F^{μν}. So σ is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. So σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, constructed from spinor indices. But for the purposes of mass dimension, we can treat σ as a Lorentz scalar when considering the product ψ̄ σ F.

So, the term is ψ̄ (σ F). Let's find the mass dimension of each part.

ψ̄ σ ψ: Each ψ is dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3. Since σ is a product of two gamma matrices, each of dimension 1, but σ itself is dimension 1 (since it's a combination of two gamma matrices multiplied together). So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension (3/2)*2 + 1? Wait, wait, maybe I should think of each object's dimension.

Wait, the Dirac spinor ψ has dimension 3/2. The term ψ̄ is also 3/2. The σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, but for dimension counting, it's treated as a scalar with dimension 0, because it's made from gamma matrices, which are dimension 1 each. Wait no, actually, the gamma matrices are dimension 1 each, so their commutator would have dimension 2 (because [γ_mu, γ_nu] is γ_mu γ_nu - γ_nu γ_mu, each term is γ_mu times γ_nu, each has dimension 1, so together dimension 2). So σ_{mu nu} is (i/2) [gamma_mu, gamma_nu], which would have dimension 2. But wait, actually, the structure is a tensor, so maybe when we contract with F, which is dimension 2, the product would be σ F, each with dimension 2, so σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} would have dimension 4?

Wait, let me think again. The term is ψ̄ σ F. The F is F^{mu nu}, which has dimension 2. The σ is σ_{mu nu}, which is dimension 2? Or is it dimension 1? No, because each σ is made from two gamma matrices, so dimension 2.

So σ F would have dimension (2 + 2) =4? Because each is dimension 2. So the term ψ̄ σ F would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 + 2? Wait, no, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. But the σ F is a Lorentz scalar, so the product is (σ F), which is dimension 2 (from σ) plus dimension 2 (from F) equals 4? So the term ψ̄ σ F has dimension (3/2 + 3/2) + (2 + 2) )? Wait no, I'm mixing things up. The term is ψ̄ multiplied by σ F. So the dimensions are (3/2) + (2 +2) = 3/2 +4? That can't be right because that would make the term dimension 5.5, which is way higher than allowed.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about each part. The term ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is a scalar, and when multiplied by F^{mu nu}, it becomes a tensor, but for the purpose of the Lagrangian, the term should have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the term is L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ F]. Let's compute the dimension of [ψ̄ σ F].

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. ψ has dimension 3/2. σ is dimension 2 (as it's made from two gamma matrices). F has dimension 2.

Wait, but how are the dimensions multiplied here? Each Lorentz index would have its own counting, but for mass dimension, we're considering the scaling. So the product ψ̄ σ F would have (3/2) + (2) + (2). But wait, no, I think I'm miscounting. Let me think: Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2. Then, σ is a tensor, but as a spinor structure, its dimension is 2 because each γ is dimension 1. Then F is a field strength tensor made from a vector potential (dimension 1), so F is dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ (σ F) would have (3/2) [from ψ̄] + (2) [from σ] + (2) [from F] = 3/2 +4 = 5.5? That's 11/2, but that can't be right because the Lagrangian's term must have dimension 4. So this suggests that κ must have a negative dimension to bring the whole term down to dimension 4.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up. Let's redo it step by step.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2; each σ_{mu nu} is a product of two gamma matrices, each of dimension 1, so σ is dimension 2. F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has:

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ → 2

ψ → 3/2

F → 2

But wait, how are these multiplied? The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So that's (3/2) + (2) + (3/2) + (2) = (3 + 4) = 7? No, that's overcounting. Because the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Wait, no, it's more like (ψ̄ σ ψ) multiplied by F.

Wait, but σ and F are both tensors, so when they're contracted (sigma_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}), that product becomes a scalar. So the term (sigma F) has dimension 2 + 2 =4.

So the term is ψ̄ (sigma F) ψ. Wait, no: the ψ̄ is a spinor, sigma F is a scalar, and ψ is a spinor. So (ψ̄ sigma F) is a spinor, and then multiplied by another ψ? Wait, no, I think the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. That would be a scalar because ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is a scalar (since σ_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor and ψ̄ and ψ are spinors), and then F^{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor. So when you contract sigma_{mu nu} with F^{mu nu}, you get a scalar. So the entire term is a product of spinor bilinear (ψ̄ σ ψ) and a scalar (F term).

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ multiplied by σ_{mu nu}, ψ, and F^{mu nu}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the term as ψ̄ [σ_{mu nu} ψ] F^{mu nu}.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of Feynman diagrams and the scaling. Each field has to contribute its dimension.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2. Then, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of a vector field, which has dimension 2. How about σ_{mu nu}? Since σ is made from two gamma matrices, each of dimension 1, so σ has dimension 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is (3/2) + (2) + (3/2) + (2) = 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 4 =7. But that's way over 4. So the whole term's dimension would be [κ] + 7 =4.

So [κ] = 4 -7= -3? No, that can't be right because that would make κ have a mass dimension of -3, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the dimensions. Let's think again. The term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. So in terms of Lorentz indices, ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ = scalar (because ψ̄ is a spinor, σ is a tensor, and ψ is another spinor. So when you contract σ_{mu nu} with ψ̄ and ψ, it's a scalar. Then F^{mu nu} is a tensor, so when you contract sigma^{mu nu} with F_{mu nu}, you get a scalar.

Wait, but the term would be ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F^{mu nu}... No, perhaps the term is (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) F^{mu nu}.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

So each ψ is 3/2. The σ is dimension 2. F is dimension 2.

So the term is (ψ̄ σ ψ) × F. Wait, but the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each component's dimension:

ψ̄ →3/2

σ →2

ψ→3/2

F→2

So the product is 3/2 + 2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2+2 is 4, total 7. So the entire term has dimension 7. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so κ must have dimension [κ] =4 -7= -3. But that's not an option. So I must be making a mistake.

Another approach: Perhaps I should consider the term as a product of (ψ̄ σ F) and ψ. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think in terms of each field separately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass dimension of each field and the coupling. The Lagrangian term is:

L_int = κ ψ̄ (σ_{mu nu}) ψ F^{mu nu}.

So each field's dimension: ψ is 3/2, F is 2. σ_{mu nu} is made from gamma matrices, which are dimension 1. So σ_{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So the term inside is ψ̄ (σ ψ) F. Wait, that's not quite right. Let me think of each term in the product.

The part ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is a scalar with dimension (3/2) *2 (from ψ̄ ψ) plus the dimension from σ. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think of the product as ψ̄ (σ_{mu nu} ψ) F^{mu nu}.

Alternatively, maybe the product ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is a four-vector, because σ_{mu nu} is antisymmetric. So when multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which is antisymmetric, the product becomes a scalar.

So the term is a scalar, so it can be part of the Lagrangian.

So the entire term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Now, find the mass dimension of each factor.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.

ψ has dimension 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} has dimension 2.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Now, the product of all four: (3/2) + (3/2) + (2) + (2) = 3 +4=7.

So the term has dimension 7. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling κ must have dimension [κ] = 4 -7 = -3. But none of the options have -3. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the indices are contracted. Because when you have sigma_{mu nu} multiplied by F^{mu nu}, that contraction doesn't add any dimension. So perhaps the product of sigma and F contributes dimension 2 each, but when contracted, it's still dimension 2+2=4? Hmm, no, that doesn't change the fact that each has dimension 2.

Wait, maybe the sigma and F contraction doesn't add to the dimension. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating the dimensions of sigma.

Wait, another approach: each field's mass dimension can be found via the equations of motion. For a term in the Lagrangian L, the dimension is [L] =4.

So the term is κ ψ̄ σ F.

Each ψ is [ψ] = 3/2.

Each [σ] = 2.

[F] =2.

So the term ψ̄ σ F ψ would have [ψ̄] + [σ] + [F] + [ψ] = 3/2 + 2 + 2 +3/2 = 3/2 *2=3, plus 4=7.

So the term is dimension 7. So [κ] must be 4-7= -3. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}, which can be written as κ (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) F^{mu nu}.

But (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) is a four-vector. Then F^{mu nu} is a four-tensor. So when you multiply them, you get a scalar. So the term is a scalar.

Wait, but the dimension of (ψ̄ σ ψ) would be? Let's see: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 2, ψ is 3/2. So the product is (3/2) + 2 + (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus 2 is 5. So (ψ̄ σ ψ) has dimension 5. Then multiplied by F^{mu nu} which is 2, so 5 +2=7. So the entire term is 7, so κ must be 4 -7= -3.

But the options don't have that. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the dimension of sigma mu nu. Because sigma is a commutator of two gamma matrices, each with dimension 1. So [gamma_mu, gamma_nu] has dimension 2, so sigma has dimension 2. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should think of the term as (ψ̄ σ F) ψ. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the term as ψ̄ (σ F) ψ. So (σ F) is a tensor? No, because sigma_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} is a scalar.

Wait aha! Because when you contract sigma_{mu nu} with F^{mu nu}, that's a scalar. So (sigma F) is a scalar with dimension 2+2=4.

So the term is ψ̄ (sigma F) ψ. Now, sigma F is a scalar of dimension 4.

So ψ̄ is 3/2, (sigma F) is 4, ψ is 3/2.

So the entire term has dimension (3/2) +4 + (3/2) = 3/2 +3/2=3 +4=7. So again, the term is dimension 7, so [κ] must be 4-7= -3. But none of the options have that.

Hmm, the only possible explanation is that I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that sigma_{mu nu} is dimension 1. No, because it's made from two gamma matrices, each of dimension 1, so it's 2.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to think about each part:

The term is L = κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each ψ is 3/2.

Each F is 2.

Each σ is 2.

So the product: ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (2) * ψ (3/2) * F (2).

So adding them:

3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) = 3.

2 (σ) + 2 (F) =4.

Total is 3+4=7.

So the term has dimension 7. So the coupling κ must have [κ] =4-7= -3.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct dimension of the term is determined by the number of fields. Let's think about the general rule for renormalizability. The interaction term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. So the term is dimension 4.

Wait, but the term has dimension 7, which can't be. So perhaps the given Lagrangian isn't renormalizable.

Wait, but according to the options, the [kappa] must be either -1 or 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of F. Let me think. The field strength tensor F is built from the field A, which has dimension 1. The field A has dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1. So when you take F = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, each A is dimension 1, so F is dimension 2.

So F has dimension 2.

Each ψ is 3/2.

So the term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, perhaps the term is a four-fermion interaction? No, because it's ψ̄ σ F ψ, which is a three-fermion term plus F. Wait, no, that's two ψ's and one F.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering each field's dimension as additive. But actually, when you have a product of fields, the mass dimension is the sum of each field's dimension.

So for the term L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. sigma is 2, F is 2.

So the term without κ is [3/2 (ψ̄) ] + [2 (sigma) ] + [3/2 (ψ) ] + [2 (F) ] = 3/2 +3/2 =3, 2 +2=4. Total 7.

So the term has dimension 7. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4-7= -3. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is dimension 5, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps sigma is dimension 1. Then the term would be 3/2 +3/2 + 1 +2 = 3/2*2=3, plus 3 (1+2=3), total 6. So [kappa] would be 4-6= -2. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct dimension is 5 for the term, which would give [kappa]=-1.

Let me see: if the term has dimension 5, then [kappa] =4-5= -1. Which is option A or C.

How can the term have dimension 5?

Wait, perhaps sigma has dimension 1. Because sigma is (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu]. Each gamma has dimension 1, so sigma has dimension (1 +1) =2? Or considering each gamma is dimension 1, the commutator is dimension 2, so sigma is dimension 2.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible options. The options for [kappa] are -1 and 1.

Let me compute the dimension of the term assuming [kappa]=-1. Then the term's dimension would be 4 +1=5. Because [L] =4, so [kappa] + [other terms] =4.

So [other terms] =5.

Wait, how can the product of the other terms sum to 5?

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2.

sigma is 2.

F is 2.

So [ψ̄ sigma F ψ] = (3/2) +2 +2 +3/2= 3/2*2 =3, 2+2=4. 3+4=7? No.

Wait, maybe the term is ψ̄ sigma F, which would be (3/2) +2 +2 =7/2=3.5. Then multiplied by ψ would add 3/2, making 5.5. But that's not 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is [ψ̄ sigma F] * ψ, which would be (3/2 +2 +2) + 3/2 =3.5 +1.5=5. So that's 5. Then [kappa] would be 4-5= -1. So that gives [kappa]=-1, which is option A or C.

But then, why would the term be [ψ̄ sigma F] * ψ?

Wait, the term is L = κ ψ̄ sigma_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Alternatively, perhaps sigma_{mu nu} is treated as dimension 1 when considering the term. But that doesn't make sense because it's made from two gamma matrices.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible answer options. The options are:

A) [k]= -1, renormalizable.

B) [k]=1, renormalizable.

C) [k] =-1, not renormalizable.

D) [k]=1, not renormalizable.

Renormalizability is determined by whether the dimension of the coupling is ≥0. Because in perturbation theory, each vertex brings in a factor of g (coupling), and in loop integrals, you need the coupling to have positive dimension to have a finite theory.

Wait, no. The renormalizability condition is that the coupling has dimension ≤ (4 - (sum of fields dimensions)).

Wait, wait, the general rule is that the interaction term should have mass dimension ≤4. So the dimension of the term is 4. The term's dimension is [κ] + sum of [fields]. So [κ] =4 - sum [fields].

For the term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling should be ≥0. Because if [κ] <0, the coupling becomes relevant, and the theory is not renormalizable.

So in our case, the sum of the fields' dimensions is 7. So [k] =4 -7 =-3. Which is less than zero. So the theory is not renormalizable.

But none of the options have [k] =-3. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum.

Alternative approach: Each field has a certain dimension. The term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, but sigma is a tensor made from gamma matrices, not a separate field. So the fields are ψ, F.

Wait, perhaps sigma is part of the operator, not a field. So when counting the dimension of the term, we don't count sigma as a field, but as part of the operator. So sigma is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimension 1 each, so sigma is dimension 2.

Wait, but in the term, sigma is part of the operator acting on the spinor fields.

So the fields are ψ and F. So the sum of the fields' dimensions is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] =3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3+2=5.

So the term has dimension [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=4-5= -1.

So [kappa]=-1.

Then, for renormalizability, check if [kappa] ≥0. Since here it's -1, which is less than 0. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So the correct option is C: [k]=-1, not renormalizable.

But wait, let me check again. The term is ψ̄ σ F ψ. So the fields are ψ, F. The sigma is part of the operator, not a field. So the fields contribute 3/2 (ψ̄) + 2 (F) +3/2 (ψ).

Wait, but F is a field, and ψ is a field. So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 =5. So [kappa] =4-5=-1.

So the theory's coupling has dimension -1, which is negative. Hence, the interaction term is non-renormalizable.

So the correct option is C: [k]=-1, not renormalizable.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
In 4-dimensional spacetime:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$.
- The $\gamma$ matrices are dimensionless, so $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$, being a commutator of two $\gamma$ matrices, has mass dimension $2$.

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of the Interaction Term
The interaction term is $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$. Breaking it down:
- $\bar{\psi}$ has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\psi$ has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$.

The total mass dimension of the term is:
\[
\text{Dimension of the term} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 + 2 = 7.
\]

Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension $4$ in 4D spacetime, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 7 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 4 - 7 = -3.
\]

However, this result does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, we realize that $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is not an independent field but part of the operator acting on the spinor fields. Thus, we only consider the dimensions of $\bar{\psi}$, $\psi$, and $F^{\mu\nu}$.

### Step 3: Correct Calculation of $\kappa$'s Dimension
The relevant fields are $\bar{\psi}$, $\psi$, and $F^{\mu\nu}$. Their total dimension is:
\[
\text{Dimension of the term} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
For the Lagrangian to have dimension $4$, the coupling $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa] \geq 0$. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is less than $0$. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
