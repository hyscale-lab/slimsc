Okay, I'm trying to solve this enthalpy of neutralization problem. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. So, the problem is about mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually measured per mole of acid reacting with a base. But wait, in this case, there are three solutions, so maybe some reactions are happening between them. I should probably figure out all the possible reactions first.

Let me list the substances: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, when they mix, the acids will react with the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base with two OH- ions. HCl has one H+ each, and H2SO4 has two H+ each. So the total H+ from the acids and OH- from the base will neutralize each other.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it will donate 2 H+ per mole. So total H+ is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So OH- moles = 0.1 ×2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, which is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles of H+.

The OH- is 0.2 moles.

When they mix, H+ and OH- will neutralize to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is usually about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is around -57 kJ/mol).

So, the moles of H+ available are 0.28, but only 0.2 moles of OH-. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. All the OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of H+ that actually reacts is 0.2 moles. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

Wait, but wait. The H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. Let me see how the neutralization works. The OH- will first neutralize the strongest acid, but since HCl and H2SO4 are both strong, maybe they neutralize in the order they are available. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to worry about the order because they'll all contribute their H+.

So, the neutralization will involve 0.2 moles of OH- reacting with 0.2 moles of H+. The enthalpy change is then 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options are in different units. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is close but in kcal. Oh, wait, I need to check the units.

Wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules, but sometimes people use kilocalories. Oh, wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as about -57 kJ/mol. But sometimes it's expressed in kilocalories. 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 13.68 kcal. Because 57,000 J is 57 kJ, and 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.61 kcal.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate exactly. 1 calorie is 4.184 J. So 1 kJ is 1000 J, which is equal to 1000 /4.184 ≈ 239.006 calories, which is 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is 57 × 0.239 ≈ 13.683 kcal.

But wait, in the reaction, I have 0.2 moles reacting, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 * 0.239 ≈ -2.72 kcal. Or wait, maybe I should convert the total kJ to kcal first.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- moles, see the neutralization, and compute the enthalpy based on that.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

They will neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O. The moles of H+ remaining after reaction = 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

So, the amount that actually undergoes neutralization is 0.2 mol H+.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Or in kcal, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * (1 kJ = ~0.239 kcal) → 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal, but since it's negative, it's -2.72 kcal.

Wait, wait, no. Because 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal, so 11.4 kJ is 11.4 × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the neutralization is considering the total H+ and OH- and the excess H+.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, each releasing about 57 kJ. So 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ released, which is exothermic, so negative.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal. But wait, I thought the calculation was -2.72 kcal. Hmm, I must have messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion earlier. Let me redo it.

57 kJ per mole is the same as 57,000 J per mole.

1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.61 kcal.

So, 1 mole of H+ neutralization is -13.61 kcal.

Wait, wait, no: because 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is 57,000 /4184 ≈ 13.61 kcal, so per mole, it's -13.61 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles would give 0.2 × (-13.61) ≈ -2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see. Let me reevaluate.

Total H+ is 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

They react 1:1, so 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 moles H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

Wait, but some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ (or OH-), so the calculation should be based on that.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But if the question is in kcal, then 11.4 kJ is 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, so option A.

But wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. Wait, but neutralization usually refers to the reaction of acid and base, and the enthalpy per mole of reaction. But when you have excess acid or base, only the neutral part contributes.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total acid and base.

Wait, let me think again. The mixing leads to:

Total H+ available: 0.28 moles.

Total OH-: 0.2 moles.

The neutralization would be between 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

The remaining 0.08 H+ would not react, as there's no more OH-.

So the reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72).

So the answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but the option B is -11.42 kcal. Did I miscalculate the unit conversion?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate without using the approximation.

1 kJ = 1000 J = 1000 /4184 kcal ≈ 0.2390 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ = 11.4 * 0.2390 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     As H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

   Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is present in smaller quantity (\( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \)), it is the limiting reactant. All \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \) will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \).  
   The remaining \( \text{H}^+ \) is \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.61 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacts:  
   \[
   \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   Converting to kcal:  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

4. **Select the correct option:**
   The enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
