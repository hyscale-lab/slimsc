Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. That's helpful.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedo is same for both, I can ignore that part for the ratio. So the ratio would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) )^(1/4?), wait, no, wait. Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance and directly proportional to the star's temperature. Oh, right, the formula is T_eq = T_star * (L_star/(16πσ a² (1 - A)))^(1/4), but since L is proportional to R_star² T_star^4, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, another way. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). But since A is the same for both, the (1-A) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because R_star and 2 are constants. So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) ?

Wait, wait, let me think again. The standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). So if I have two planets 1 and 2, then T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(R/(2a1)) ] / [sqrt(R/(2a2)) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because the 2 and R terms cancel out.

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, but wait, the star's T is 6300 K, but the Earth's equilibrium temperature is based on the Sun's T? No, in this case, the star's T is 6300 K, which is similar to the Sun (Sun is about 5778 K). So the T_star in the formula is this star's T, not the Sun's.

So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets. But how?

The problem gives data about the radial velocity shifts. The RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's wobble. The shift is related to the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. 

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = [ (G * M_star * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^2 * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) ? Wait, no, perhaps a more precise formula.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1. Also, for most exoplanets, M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_planet + M_star ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3).

But wait, in this problem, instead of velocity semi-amplitude, the question gives the Doppler shift in terms of wavelength. Oh right, the Doppler shift formula relates velocity to wavelength shift.

The Doppler shift is given by δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity. Since the star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelength shifts. So, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity, so δλ = K * λ / c.

Wait, but in the question, for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. The line given is [OI] at 6300 Å. So λ is 6300 Å.

So, for each planet, we can find K using δλ = (K * λ) / c.

So K1 = (c * δλ1) / λ. Similarly for K2.

Let me compute K1 and K2.

Given that, c is speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s, but since we're dealing in Ångströms, perhaps better to express in terms compatible.

Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. The speed of light c is 2.99792e8 m/s.

But perhaps a more convenient approach is to calculate K (in m/s) using K = (δλ / λ) * c.

Wait, actually, the formula is δλ/λ = v/c, so v = c * (δλ/λ).

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) = c * (3e-5) ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute that: 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e8) = approx 4.76e-9. So v1 = c * (δλ/λ) = 3e8 m/s * 0.03 /6300.

Wait, 3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. 0.03 divided by 6300 is 0.03/6300 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e8) ) = approx 4.76e-9. So v1 = 3e8 * 4.76e-9 = approx 1.428 m/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, δλ is 0.04, so 0.04/6300 = ~6.349e-6. So v2 = 3e8 * (0.04 /6300) = 3e8 * 4e-5/6.3e3? Wait, 0.04/6300 = 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e8) ) ≈ 6.349e-9. So v2 = 3e8 * 6.349e-9 = approx 1.9047 m/s.

Wait, let me recalculate that accurately.

For Planet1: δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c = (0.03 /6300) * 3e5 km/s.

Wait, wait, wait. Because 1 km = 1e5 cm, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of units.

Alternatively, since 1 Å = 1e-10 m, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So v1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c = (0.03/6300) * 3e8 m/s.

0.03 /6300 is 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = 4.7619e-9.

So v1 = 4.7619e-9 * 3e8 = approx 1.42857 m/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * 3e8 m/s.

0.04 /6300 is 4e-5/6.3e3 = 6.3492e-9.

v2 = 6.3492e-9 * 3e8 = approx 1.90476 m/s.

So the RV semi-amplitudes are K1 ≈1.4286 m/s and K2≈1.9048 m/s.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital parameters. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_*, we can approximate K ≈ ( ( (G) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2) * (P) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/c )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a more manageable formula. Another way, K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) * (a (1 - e^2))^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

But with e=0, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K = [ ( G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2) * a^(1) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( P )^(-1/3) ) * (2π)^(-1/3) * (c factor?)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the approximation for K when M_p << M_*, which is:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* )^(2) * (a) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (P) )^(-1/3) ) * ( 2π )^(-1/3) ) * c ?

Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula from the radial velocity method. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * ( (1 - e²) )^(1/2) * (2π)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps better to use the simplified version. Since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * (a (1 - e²) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π P ) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates K, M_p, M_*, a, P, etc.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e^2) ) )

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think of another approach.

The main point is that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2) a )) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the relation between a1 and a2.

Because both planets orbit the same star, and the question gives us K1 and K2 for each planet.

We can write the ratio K1/K2 = ( (M1 ) / (M2 ) ) * ( a2 / a1 ) )^(1/3).

Wait, let's think about the formula for K. For each planet, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*² )^(1/3) * (1 / a )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²) )

But e=0, so we can ignore that. So K is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_*^2 a ) )^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = [ ( M1 / ( M_*^2 a1 ) ) / ( M2 / ( M_*^2 a2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the ratio:

K1/K2 = [ ( M1 a2 ) / ( M2 a1 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^3 = ( M1 a2 ) / ( M2 a1 )

We can solve for a2/a1.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. We have K1 = 1.4286 m/s, K2=1.9048 m/s.

So K1/K2 ≈ 1.4286 / 1.9048 ≈ 0.75.

So (0.75)^3 = ( (M1 a2) / (M2 a1) )

M1 is mass of planet1: 7 Earth masses. M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So (0.75)^3 ≈ ( (7 * a2) / (5 * a1) )

0.421875 ≈ (7 a2)/(5 a1)

Multiply both sides by 5 a1:

0.421875 *5 a1 ≈ 7 a2 → 2.109375 a1 ≈7 a2 → a2≈ (2.109375 /7 ) a1 → a2≈ 0.3013 a1.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because a2 is supposed to be closer if it's causing a larger RV shift. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. I think I might have messed the exponents or the ratio.

Earlier, I had K1/K2 = [ ( M1 a2 ) / ( M2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = [ ( M1 a2 )/( M2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides:

( K1 / K2 )^3 = ( M1 a2 )/( M2 a1 )

We can rearrange this to find a2/a1 = ( ( K1^3 M2 ) / ( K2^3 M1 ) ) )

Let me compute this.

Compute ( K1/K2 )^3: (1.4286/1.9048 )^3 ≈ (0.75)^3 = 0.421875.

So,

(M1 a2)/(M2 a1) ) = 0.421875

We can rearrange to:

a2/a1 = (0.421875 * M2 ) / ( M1 )

Plugging in M1=7, M2=5:

a2/a1 = (0.421875 *5 ) /7 ≈ (2.109375)/7 ≈ 0.3013.

So a2 is approximately 0.3013 times a1. So a2 is smaller than a1. Which makes sense because Planet2 has a larger RV semi-amplitude, meaning it's causing the star to move more, which would imply it's more massive or closer. Wait, but Planet1 has a larger mass than Planet2? No, Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, Planet2 is5. So if Planet1 is more massive, but the RV semi-amplitude K2 is larger than K1, that suggests that Planet2 is closer to the star, because a planet closer would cause a larger RV shift for the same mass.

So with a2 < a1, that makes sense. So a2 =0.3013 a1.

Now, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio.

Earlier, we thought T_eq ratio would be sqrt(a2/a1 ), because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R*/(2a)).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )

Because, T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)) * ... and T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)) * ...

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So with a2 ≈0.3013 a1,

T1/T2 = sqrt( 0.3013 ) ≈ 0.549.

Wait, approximately 0.549. But let's compute it more accurately.

0.3013 is approximately 0.3, so sqrt(0.3) is about 0.5477. So 0.549 is close.

So the ratio is about 0.549, which is approximately 0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in the a2/a1 calculation?

Let me re-calculate the exact value.

Given K1 = 0.03 /6300 * c, and K2 = 0.04 /6300 * c.

So, K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) ) = 3/4 = 0.75.

So (K1/K2)^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64 ≈0.421875.

Then, (M1 a2)/(M2 a1) =0.421875.

So a2/a1 = (0.421875 * M2 )/( M1 )

M2=5, M1=7.

So (0.421875 *5 )/7 = (2.109375)/7 ≈0.30134.

Thus, a2=0.30134 a1.

So the ratio sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.30134) ≈0.549.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio is approx 0.549. So T1 is about 0.55 times T2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1/T2 = ~0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, option D is ~1.05. Hmm, 0.55 is closer to 0.53 than to 1.05.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the a2/a1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation.

Let me compute (0.421875 *5 ) /7.

0.421875 *5 = 2.109375.

Divided by 7: 2.109375 /7 = 0.3013392857.

So a2/a1 =0.301339.

sqrt(0.301339) = sqrt(0.301339) = approximately 0.549.

Hmm, so about 0.549, which is about 0.55. The closest option is C) ~0.53. Maybe a more precise calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the K ratio.

Wait, K1 is 0.03/6300 = 0.03/(6.3e3) = 4.76190476e-6.

K2 is 0.04/6300 =0.04/(6.3e3) =6.34920635e-6.

So, K1/K2 = (4.76190476e-6 ) / (6.34920635e-6 ) = 0.75.

So, that's exact, 3/4.

So (K1/K2)^3 is (3/4)^3 = 27/64 = 0.421875.

So that's correct.

So, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature.

Wait, another thought: The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But wait, is it (R_star/a) or (R_star/(2a))?

Yes, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( ( R/(2a1) ) / ( R/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So that part is correct.

So if a2 is 0.3013 a1, then T_eq1 is sqrt(0.3013) times T_eq2. Which is approx 0.549, so 0.55.

Which isn't exactly one of the options. Wait, the options are A) ~0.98, B)~1.30, C)~0.53, D)~1.05.

Hmm, none is exactly at 0.55, but the closest is C) ~0.53.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the RV semi-amplitude K leading to a1 and a2.

Wait, another possible source of error: perhaps the formula K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^2 a ) )^(1/3). So K1/K2 = [ (M1 a2)/(M2 a1) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me write the formula as K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^2 * a ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) * (1/ (c) ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the exact formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v ) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P c ) )^(1/3) )

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / (P c^3) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another way: The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / M_*^(2/3 )

This is a simplified version.

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( P )^(1/3 )

Wait, but I also know that from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_* + M_p ) )

Since M_p << M_*, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So, a^3 = ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So, a = [ ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, substituting a into the K equation.

K = ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) )

But from a, a is proportional to (M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

So, a is proportional to ( M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

But in terms of K, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * ( P )^(1/3 )

Wait, I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using the given K1 and K2.

Given that:

K1 = ( (M1 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (a1 )^(1/3) ) ) ) * C

K2 = ( (M2 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (a2 )^(1/3) ) ) ) * C

Where C is a constant involving G, P, and other terms.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_* )

So, P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) ]^(1/2 )

So, P is proportional to (a^3 )^(1/2 ) = a^(3/2 )

But then, a = ( G M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )/(4 pi^2 )^(1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to relate the two K values.

K1/K2 = [ (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) ) ) ] 

Wait, because K1 proportional to M1 / a1^(1/3 ), and K2 proportional to M2 / a2^(1/3 )

Wait, let me think again.

From the formula, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) )

= ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Multiply both sides by 5/7:

0.75 * (5/7) )= (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

0.75 * 5 =3.75 /7 ≈ 0.5357.

So,

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) ≈0.5357.

Cube both sides:

a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357 )^3 ≈0.153.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, earlier I had a2/a1 ≈0.3013, but this approach gives a2/a1 ≈0.153.

Wait, that's a big discrepancy. So which is correct?

Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, according to the correct formula, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) ), because K = ( v ) is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_*^2 a )^(1/3) ), but since M_* is fixed, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / (a^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) )

= ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5 ) /7 = (3.75 )/7 ≈ 0.5357.

So,

a2/a1 = (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.153.

Ah, so a2=0.153 a1.

So now, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.153 ) ≈0.391.

Wait, that's about 0.39, which isn't one of the options. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for K is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_*^2 * a ) )^(1/3) * ( P )^(-1/3 )

Hmm, but I might be missing some factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct formula from a reliable source. Let me think.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) )^(1/3 )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) / (c ) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 π^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So P = ( (4 π^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting that into K:

K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( ( G M_* )^(1/3 ) )/( (4 π^2 )^(1/6) a ) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify.

Substituting P:

K ≈ (2 π G )^(1/3) / c * M_p / M_*^(2/3) * [ ( G M_* )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/6 ) * a^(-1/3 )

Simplify exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( G M_* )^(1/6 ) = (2 pi )^(1/3) * G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) * M_*^(1/6 )

Which is 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * G^(1/2) * M_*^(1/6 )

Denominator: c * (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) * a^(1/3 )

(4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) is (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So denominator becomes c * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/3 )

Putting it all together:

K ≈ [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6) M_p ] / [ c * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2^(1/3) cancels. pi^(1/3) cancels.

So,

K ≈ ( G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6 ) M_p ) / ( c a^(1/3) )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6 ) M_p ) / ( c a^(1/3) )

Hmm, that's an expression for K. So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

So, the ratio K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) ) = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So, we have:

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So, as before, 0.75 = (7/5 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So, (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = 0.75 *5 /7 = 3.75/7 ≈0.5357

So, a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.153

So, a2 =0.153 a1.

Now, equilibrium temperatures are T1 and T2.

T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so:

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.153 ) ≈ 0.391.

Wait, but none of the options are near 0.39. The options are 0.53 (C), 0.98 (A), 1.30 (B), 1.05 (D).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused which planet is which in the question.

The question says:

Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å,

Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 Å.

So, K1 = 0.03 Å, K2=0.04 Å.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I said K1 was less than K2, so K1/K2=0.75.

But perhaps when using the formula, it's K1/K2 = ( M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) )

Wait, no, the formula is K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) ) = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So with K1=0.03, K2=0.04, K1/K2=0.75.

So, 0.75 = (7/5 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So, (a2/a1 )^(1/3) = 0.75 *5/7 = 3.75/7 ≈0.5357.

So, a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357)^3 ≈0.153.

So, T_eq ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.153 ) ≈ 0.391.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that the transit method was used as well. But since we're only interested in the equilibrium temperature, which depends on distance, perhaps the transit method gives the radius of the planet, but we don't need that here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/3), so a larger K implies a smaller a.

Which is correct, because if a planet is closer, it causes a larger RV shift.

So, since K2 > K1, a2 < a1.

Which is consistent with a2/a1 being 0.153.

Hmm, but according to that, T_eq1 is T_eq1 = T_eq2 * sqrt( a2/a1 ) = T_eq2 * 0.391.

So T1 is about 0.39 times T2.

But the options don't have 0.39, but option C is ~0.53, which is larger.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor related to the star's radius or luminosity.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature includes the star's luminosity.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) )/(16 pi sigma a^2) ]^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity.

L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So, substituting L:

T_eq = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify:

= [ ( R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a^2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ T_star^4 (1 - A) R_star^2 / (4 a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

= T_star * ( (1 - A)^(1/4 ) ) * ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 )

Which is the formula I used earlier.

So, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So, the earlier approach was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the star's luminosity is not the same as the Sun's.

Because the given star has R =1.2 R_sun, T=6300 K.

The Sun's luminosity is L_sun =4 pi R_sun^2 sigma T_sun^4.

So, L =4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, for the star, L =4 pi (1.2 R_sun )^2 sigma (6300 K)^4.

So, L/L_sun = (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778 )^4.

Approximately, 5778 K is the Sun's effective temperature.

Calculate (6300/5778 ) ≈ 1.09.

(1.09 )^4 ≈1.09^2 =1.1881, squared again is ~1.41.

So, (1.2)^2 =1.44.

So, L/L_sun ≈1.44 *1.41 ≈2.03.

So the star is about twice as luminous as the Sun.

But in the equilibrium temperature formula, since T_eq depends on the star's T and the planet's a, but the L dependence is already encapsulated in the formula.

Wait, but in any case, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 would be based on a1 and a2, and R and T of the star.

Wait, but in the formula, T_eq depends on T_star, R_star, and a.

So, since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio would be:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, I think the earlier approach was correct. So, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.153 )= ~0.391.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the RV analysis.

Alternative approach: Perhaps instead of using the RV shifts, I can use the Doppler shift method to find the mass function and then find a1 and a2.

Wait, the RV method gives the mass function, which is:

f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i )/( (M_* + M_p )^2 )

But since M_p << M_*, f(M) ≈ (M_p^3 sin^3 i )/( M_*^2 )

But without knowing sin i, we can't find the exact mass. However, since both planets are orbiting the same star, if we assume that i is the same for both (which is likely, but we don't know), then the ratio of the mass functions would be (M1^3 )/( M2^3 )

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for us to use the RV velocities to find the ratio of a1 and a2 without considering the mass.

Wait, the velocities are given as shifts in the forbidden line. So, using Doppler shift formula, K = v = (delta lambda / lambda ) * c

So, for Planet1: K1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * 3e5 km/s ≈ (0.03/6300)*3e5 = 1.4286 m/s

Similarly, K2=0.04/6300 *3e5 = ~1.9048 m/s.

So, the velocities are 1.4286 m/s and 1.9048 m/s.

But from the RV method, K is given by:

K = (v )= ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (a (1 - e² ) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: Using the fact that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v )= ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (a )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

But again, without knowing P, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law to relate P and a.

Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_* + M_p ) )

Assuming M_p << M_*, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So, P ≈ sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) )

But substituting this into K's formula:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

Substituting P:

= [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) ) )^(1/3 )

Hmm, this might be manageable.

Let me compute the second part:

(2 pi ) / ( (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) )

= (2 pi ) / ( sqrt(4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* )) )

= (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi sqrt( a^3/( G M_* ) ) )

= 1/( sqrt( a^3/( G M_* ) ) )

= sqrt( G M_* / a^3 )

So, K becomes:

= [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * [ ( G M_* / a^3 )^(1/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify exponents:

= [ G M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * [ G M_* / a^3 ]^(1/6 )

= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(2/9) a^(1/9) ) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 )

Combine like terms:

G exponents: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.

M_* exponents: -2/9 + 1/6. Let's compute:

-2/9 = -4/18, 1/6 =3/18. So total: (-4 +3)/18 = -1/18.

a exponents: -1/9 -1/2 = - (2/18 + 9/18 )= -11/18.

So,

K= G^(1/2) * M_p^(1/3) * M_*^(-1/18) * a^(-11/18 )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think of K in terms of a.

But perhaps this isn't the best use of time. Let me think of an alternative approach.

Perhaps the question wants us to use the ratio of the velocities to find the ratio of the masses and distances, but with the given data, it's leading me to a T_eq ratio that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to test that the equilibrium temperature ratio is roughly similar to the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio, which I've calculated as approximately 0.55, which is closest to option C) ~0.53.

But perhaps I made a mistake in that earlier approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the distance ratio using the RV data, but I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me try to find a1 and a2.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v )= ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So, P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) ]^(1/2 )

Substituting P into K:

K = ( (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3 ) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2 pi / [ (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) ] )^(1/3 )

Simplify the second term:

(2 pi ) / [ (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) ]

= (2 pi ) / [ (2 pi )^(1) a^(3/2 ) (G M_* )^(-1/2 ) ) ) ]

= (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi a^(3/2) (G M_* )^(-1/2) )

= 1/( a^(3/2) (G M_* )^(-1/2) )

= ( G M_* )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 )

So, the entire expression for K becomes:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3 ) a^(1/3 )) ]^(1/3 ) * [ ( G M_* )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_*^(2/9 ) a^(1/9 ) ) ) ] * [ ( G M_* )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 ) )

Combine terms:

G: (1/3) + (1/6) )= 1/2

M_*: ( -2/9 ) + (1/6 ) ) → Convert to common denominator of 18: -4/18 +3/18 = -1/18.

a: ( -1/9 ) + (-1/2 ) ) → - (2/18 +9/18 )= -11/18.

So,

K= G^(1/2 ) * M_p^(1/3 ) * M_*^(-1/18 ) * a^(-11/18 )

Now, for Planet1 and Planet2, we have:

K1/K2 = [ ( G^(1/2 ) * M1^(1/3 ) * M_*^(-1/18 ) * a1^(-11/18 ) ) ) ] / [ same for K2 ]

= ( M1^(1/3 ) / M2^(1/3 ) ) * ( a2^(11/18 ) / a1^(11/18 ) )

= ( (M1/M2 )^(1/3 ) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(11/18 ) )

So, K1/K2 = ( (M1/M2 )^(1/3 ) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(11/18 ) )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75, M1=7, M2=5.

So,

0.75 = (7/5 )^(1/3 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(11/18 )

Compute (7/5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ (1.4 )^(0.333 ) ≈1.12.

So,

0.75 = 1.12 * ( a2/a1 )^(11/18 )

Divide both sides by 1.12:

0.75 /1.12 ≈0.67.

So,

( a2/a1 )^(11/18 ) = 0.67.

Raise both sides to the power of 18/11:

a2/a1 = (0.67 )^(18/11 )

Let me compute 0.67^(18/11 ).

First, natural log of 0.67 is approx -0.4005.

Multiply by (18/11 )=1.6364: -0.4005 *1.6364≈-0.655.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.655 )≈0.518.

So, a2/a1≈0.518.

So, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.518 ) ≈0.72.

Hmm, that's closer to option A (0.98) or D (1.05), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Compute ln(0.67 )= approximately -0.40046.

Multiply by 18/11 =1.63636.

-0.40046 *1.63636≈-0.655.

e^-0.655≈0.518.

So, a2/a1=0.518.

So, T_eq1= T_eq2 * sqrt(0.518 )= T_eq2 * 0.72.

So, ratio is ~0.72.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, the problem is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is meant to be approximately 0.53, which is option C.

But earlier, using the K^3 approach gave a ratio of 0.55, which is close to 0.53. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

I'm probably overcomplicating it. The correct approach is to find the ratio of a's using K1/K2 and then take the square root for the temperature ratio.

But the initial approach gave a ratio of 0.55, which is near option C (~0.53).

So I'll go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to determine the ratio of the orbital distances (\(a_2/a_1\)).

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Shifts to Orbital Distances
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \(a_2/a_1\):

\[
\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)^3
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Known Values
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)

The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Substituting into the formula for \(a_2/a_1\):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(0.75 \cdot \frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(0.75 \cdot 0.714\right)^3 \approx (0.5357)^3 \approx 0.153
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.153} \approx 0.391
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated ratio (\(T_{\text{eq1}}/T_{\text{eq2}} \approx 0.391\)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) ~0.53**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Final Answer
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the best match is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. That's helpful.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedo is same for both, I can ignore that part for the ratio. So the ratio would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) )^(1/4?), wait, no, wait. Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance and directly proportional to the star's temperature. Oh, right, the formula is T_eq = T_star * (L_star/(16πσ a² (1 - A)))^(1/4), but since L is proportional to R_star² T_star^4, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, another way. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). But since A is the same for both, the (1-A) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because R_star and 2 are constants. So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) ?

Wait, wait, let me think again. The standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). So if I have two planets 1 and 2, then T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(R/(2a1)) ] / [sqrt(R/(2a2)) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because the 2 and R terms cancel out.

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, but wait, the star's T is 6300 K, but the Earth's equilibrium temperature is based on the Sun's T? No, in this case, the star's T is 6300 K, which is similar to the Sun (Sun is about 5778 K). So the T_star in the formula is this star's T, not the Sun's.

So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets. But how?

The problem gives data about the radial velocity shifts. The RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's wobble. The shift is related to the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. 

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = [ (G * M_star * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^2 * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) ? Wait, no, perhaps a more precise formula.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1. Also, for most exoplanets, M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_planet + M_star ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3).

But wait, in this problem, instead of velocity semi-amplitude, the question gives the Doppler shift in terms of wavelength. Oh right, the Doppler shift formula relates velocity to wavelength shift.

The Doppler shift is given by δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity. Since the star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelength shifts. So, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity, so δλ = K * λ / c.

Wait, but in the question, for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. The line given is [OI] at 6300 Å. So λ is 6300 Å.

So, for each planet, we can find K using δλ = (K * λ) / c.

So K1 = (c * δλ1) / λ. Similarly for K2.

Let me compute K1 and K2.

Given that, c is speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s, but since we're dealing in Ångströms, perhaps better to express in terms compatible.

Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. The speed of light c is 2.99792e8 m/s.

But perhaps a more convenient approach is to calculate K (in m/s) using K = (δλ / λ) * c.

Wait, actually, the formula is δλ/λ = v/c, so v = c * (δλ/λ).

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) = c * (3e-5) ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute that: 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e8) = approx 4.76e-9. So v1 = c * (δλ/λ) = 3e8 m/s * 0.03 /6300.

Wait, 3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. 0.03 divided by 6300 is 0.03/6300 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e8) ) = approx 4.76e-9. So v1 = 3e8 * 4.76e-9 = approx 1.428 m/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, δλ is 0.04, so 0.04/6300 = ~6.349e-6. So v2 = 3e8 * (0.04 /6300) = 3e8 * 4e-5/6.3e3? Wait, 0.04/6300 = 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e8) ) ≈ 6.349e-9. So v2 = 3e8 * 6.349e-9 = approx 1.9047 m/s.

Wait, let me recalculate that accurately.

For Planet1: δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c = (0.03 /6300) * 3e5 km/s.

Wait, wait, wait. Because 1 km = 1e5 cm, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of units.

Alternatively, since 1 Å = 1e-10 m, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So v1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c = (0.03/6300) * 3e8 m/s.

0.03 /6300 is 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = 4.7619e-9.

So v1 = 4.7619e-9 * 3e8 = approx 1.42857 m/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * 3e8 m/s.

0.04 /6300 is 4e-5/6.3e3 = 6.3492e-9.

v2 = 6.3492e-9 * 3e8 = approx 1.90476 m/s.

So the RV semi-amplitudes are K1 ≈1.4286 m/s and K2≈1.9048 m/s.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital parameters. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_*, we can approximate K ≈ ( ( (G) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2) * (P) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/c )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a more manageable formula. Another way, K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) * (a (1 - e^2))^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

But with e=0, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K = [ ( G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2) * a^(1) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( P )^(-1/3) ) * (2π)^(-1/3) * (c factor?)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the approximation for K when M_p << M_*, which is:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* )^(2) * (a) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (P) )^(-1/3) ) * ( 2π )^(-1/3) ) * c ?

Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula from the radial velocity method. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * ( (1 - e²) )^(1/2) * (2π)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps better to use the simplified version. Since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * (a (1 - e²) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π P ) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates K, M_p, M_*, a, P, etc.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e^2) ) )

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think of another approach.

The main point is that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2) a )) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the relation between a1 and a2.

Because both planets orbit the same star, and the question gives us K1 and K2 for each planet.

We can write the ratio K1/K2 = ( (M1 ) / (M2 ) ) * ( a2 / a1 ) )^(1/3).

Wait, let's think about the formula for K. For each planet, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*² )^(1/3) * (1 / a )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²) )

But e=0, so we can ignore that. So K is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_*^2 a ) )^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = [ ( M1 / ( M_*^2 a1 ) ) / ( M2 / ( M_*^2 a2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the ratio:

K1/K2 = [ ( M1 a2 ) / ( M2 a1 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^3 = ( M1 a2 ) / ( M2 a1 )

We can solve for a2/a1.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. We have K1 = 1.4286 m/s, K2=1.9048 m/s.

So K1/K2 ≈ 1.4286 / 1.9048 ≈ 0.75.

So (0.75)^3 = ( (M1 a2) / (M2 a1) )

M1 is mass of planet1: 7 Earth masses. M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So (0.75)^3 ≈ ( (7 * a2) / (5 * a1) )

0.421875 ≈ (7 a2)/(5 a1)

Multiply both sides by 5 a1:

0.421875 *5 a1 ≈ 7 a2 → 2.109375 a1 ≈7 a2 → a2≈ (2.109375 /7 ) a1 → a2≈ 0.3013 a1.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because a2 is supposed to be closer if it's causing a larger RV shift. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. I think I might have messed the exponents or the ratio.

Earlier, I had K1/K2 = [ ( M1 a2 ) / ( M2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = [ ( M1 a2 )/( M2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides:

( K1 / K2 )^3 = ( M1 a2 )/( M2 a1 )

We can rearrange this to find a2/a1 = ( ( K1^3 M2 ) / ( K2^3 M1 ) ) )

Let me compute this.

Compute ( K1/K2 )^3: (1.4286/1.9048 )^3 ≈ (0.75)^3 = 0.421875.

So,

(M1 a2)/(M2 a1) ) = 0.421875

We can rearrange to:

a2/a1 = (0.421875 * M2 ) / ( M1 )

Plugging in M1=7, M2=5:

a2/a1 = (0.421875 *5 ) /7 ≈ (2.109375)/7 ≈ 0.3013.

So a2 is approximately 0.3013 times a1. So a2 is smaller than a1. Which makes sense because Planet2 has a larger RV semi-amplitude, meaning it's causing the star to move more, which would imply it's more massive or closer. Wait, but Planet1 has a larger mass than Planet2? No, Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, Planet2 is5. So if Planet1 is more massive, but the RV semi-amplitude K2 is larger than K1, that suggests that Planet2 is closer to the star, because a planet closer would cause a larger RV shift for the same mass.

So with a2 < a1, that makes sense. So a2 =0.3013 a1.

Now, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio.

Earlier, we thought T_eq ratio would be sqrt(a2/a1 ), because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R*/(2a)).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )

Because, T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)) * ... and T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)) * ...

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So with a2 ≈0.3013 a1,

T1/T2 = sqrt( 0.3013 ) ≈ 0.549.

Wait, approximately 0.549. But let's compute it more accurately.

0.3013 is approximately 0.3, so sqrt(0.3) is about 0.5477. So 0.549 is close.

So the ratio is about 0.549, which is approximately 0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in the a2/a1 calculation?

Let me re-calculate the exact value.

Given K1 = 0.03 /6300 * c, and K2 = 0.04 /6300 * c.

So, K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) ) = 3/4 = 0.75.

So (K1/K2)^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64 ≈0.421875.

Then, (M1 a2)/(M2 a1) =0.421875.

So a2/a1 = (0.421875 * M2 )/( M1 )

M2=5, M1=7.

So (0.421875 *5 )/7 = (2.109375)/7 ≈0.30134.

Thus, a2=0.30134 a1.

So the ratio sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.30134) ≈0.549.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio is approx 0.549. So T1 is about 0.55 times T2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1/T2 = ~0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, option D is ~1.05. Hmm, 0.55 is closer to 0.53 than to 1.05.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the a2/a1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation.

Let me compute (0.421875 *5 ) /7.

0.421875 *5 = 2.109375.

Divided by 7: 2.109375 /7 = 0.3013392857.

So a2/a1 =0.301339.

sqrt(0.301339) = sqrt(0.301339) = approximately 0.549.

Hmm, so about 0.549, which is about 0.55. The closest option is C) ~0.53. Maybe a more precise calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the K ratio.

Wait, K1 is 0.03/6300 = 0.03/(6.3e3) = 4.76190476e-6.

K2 is 0.04/6300 =0.04/(6.3e3) =6.34920635e-6.

So, K1/K2 = (4.76190476e-6 ) / (6.34920635e-6 ) = 0.75.

So, that's exact, 3/4.

So (K1/K2)^3 is (3/4)^3 = 27/64 = 0.421875.

So that's correct.

So, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature.

Wait, another thought: The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But wait, is it (R_star/a) or (R_star/(2a))?

Yes, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( ( R/(2a1) ) / ( R/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So that part is correct.

So if a2 is 0.3013 a1, then T_eq1 is sqrt(0.3013) times T_eq2. Which is approx 0.549, so 0.55.

Which isn't exactly one of the options. Wait, the options are A) ~0.98, B)~1.30, C)~0.53, D)~1.05.

Hmm, none is exactly at 0.55, but the closest is C) ~0.53.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the RV semi-amplitude K leading to a1 and a2.

Wait, another possible source of error: perhaps the formula K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^2 a ) )^(1/3). So K1/K2 = [ (M1 a2)/(M2 a1) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me write the formula as K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^2 * a ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) * (1/ (c) ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the exact formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v ) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P c ) )^(1/3) )

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / (P c^3) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another way: The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / M_*^(2/3 )

This is a simplified version.

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( P )^(1/3 )

Wait, but I also know that from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_* + M_p ) )

Since M_p << M_*, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So, a^3 = ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So, a = [ ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, substituting a into the K equation.

K = ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) )

But from a, a is proportional to (M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

So, a is proportional to ( M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

But in terms of K, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * ( P )^(1/3 )

Wait, I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using the given K1 and K2.

Given that:

K1 = ( (M1 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (a1 )^(1/3) ) ) ) * C

K2 = ( (M2 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (a2 )^(1/3) ) ) ) * C

Where C is a constant involving G, P, and other terms.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_* )

So, P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) ]^(1/2 )

So, P is proportional to (a^3 )^(1/2 ) = a^(3/2 )

But then, a = ( G M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )/(4 pi^2 )^(1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to relate the two K values.

K1/K2 = [ (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) ) ) ] 

Wait, because K1 proportional to M1 / a1^(1/3 ), and K2 proportional to M2 / a2^(1/3 )

Wait, let me think again.

From the formula, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) )

= ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Multiply both sides by 5/7:

0.75 * (5/7) )= (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

0.75 * 5 =3.75 /7 ≈ 0.5357.

So,

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) ≈0.5357.

Cube both sides:

a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357 )^3 ≈0.153.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, earlier I had a2/a1 ≈0.3013, but this approach gives a2/a1 ≈0.153.

Wait, that's a big discrepancy. So which is correct?

Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, according to the correct formula, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) ), because K = ( v ) is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_*^2 a )^(1/3) ), but since M_* is fixed, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / (a^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) )

= ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5 ) /7 = (3.75 )/7 ≈ 0.5357.

So,

a2/a1 = (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.153.

Ah, so a2=0.153 a1.

So now, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.153 ) ≈0.391.

Wait, that's about 0.39, which isn't one of the options. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for K is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_*^2 * a ) )^(1/3) * ( P )^(-1/3 )

Hmm, but I might be missing some factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct formula from a reliable source. Let me think.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) )^(1/3 )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) / (c ) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 π^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So P = ( (4 π^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting that into K:

K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( ( G M_* )^(1/3 ) )/( (4 π^2 )^(1/6) a ) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify.

Substituting P:

K ≈ (2 π G )^(1/3) / c * M_p / M_*^(2/3) * [ ( G M_* )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/6 ) * a^(-1/3 )

Simplify exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( G M_* )^(1/6 ) = (2 pi )^(1/3) * G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) * M_*^(1/6 )

Which is 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * G^(1/2) * M_*^(1/6 )

Denominator: c * (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) * a^(1/3 )

(4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) is (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So denominator becomes c * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/3 )

Putting it all together:

K ≈ [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6) M_p ] / [ c * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2^(1/3) cancels. pi^(1/3) cancels.

So,

K ≈ ( G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6 ) M_p ) / ( c a^(1/3) )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6 ) M_p ) / ( c a^(1/3) )

Hmm, that's an expression for K. So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

So, the ratio K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) ) = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So, we have:

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So, as before, 0.75 = (7/5 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So, (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = 0.75 *5 /7 = 3.75/7 ≈0.5357

So, a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.153

So, a2 =0.153 a1.

Now, equilibrium temperatures are T1 and T2.

T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so:

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.153 ) ≈ 0.391.

Wait, but none of the options are near 0.39. The options are 0.53 (C), 0.98 (A), 1.30 (B), 1.05 (D).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused which planet is which in the question.

The question says:

Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å,

Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 Å.

So, K1 = 0.03 Å, K2=0.04 Å.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I said K1 was less than K2, so K1/K2=0.75.

But perhaps when using the formula, it's K1/K2 = ( M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) )

Wait, no, the formula is K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) ) = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So with K1=0.03, K2=0.04, K1/K2=0.75.

So, 0.75 = (7/5 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So, (a2/a1 )^(1/3) = 0.75 *5/7 = 3.75/7 ≈0.5357.

So, a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357)^3 ≈0.153.

So, T_eq ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.153 ) ≈ 0.391.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that the transit method was used as well. But since we're only interested in the equilibrium temperature, which depends on distance, perhaps the transit method gives the radius of the planet, but we don't need that here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/3), so a larger K implies a smaller a.

Which is correct, because if a planet is closer, it causes a larger RV shift.

So, since K2 > K1, a2 < a1.

Which is consistent with a2/a1 being 0.153.

Hmm, but according to that, T_eq1 is T_eq1 = T_eq2 * sqrt( a2/a1 ) = T_eq2 * 0.391.

So T1 is about 0.39 times T2.

But the options don't have 0.39, but option C is ~0.53, which is larger.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor related to the star's radius or luminosity.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature includes the star's luminosity.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) )/(16 pi sigma a^2) ]^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity.

L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So, substituting L:

T_eq = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify:

= [ ( R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a^2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ T_star^4 (1 - A) R_star^2 / (4 a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

= T_star * ( (1 - A)^(1/4 ) ) * ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 )

Which is the formula I used earlier.

So, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So, the earlier approach was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the star's luminosity is not the same as the Sun's.

Because the given star has R =1.2 R_sun, T=6300 K.

The Sun's luminosity is L_sun =4 pi R_sun^2 sigma T_sun^4.

So, L =4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, for the star, L =4 pi (1.2 R_sun )^2 sigma (6300 K)^4.

So, L/L_sun = (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778 )^4.

Approximately, 5778 K is the Sun's effective temperature.

Calculate (6300/5778 ) ≈ 1.09.

(1.09 )^4 ≈1.09^2 =1.1881, squared again is ~1.41.

So, (1.2)^2 =1.44.

So, L/L_sun ≈1.44 *1.41 ≈2.03.

So the star is about twice as luminous as the Sun.

But in the equilibrium temperature formula, since T_eq depends on the star's T and the planet's a, but the L dependence is already encapsulated in the formula.

Wait, but in any case, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 would be based on a1 and a2, and R and T of the star.

Wait, but in the formula, T_eq depends on T_star, R_star, and a.

So, since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio would be:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, I think the earlier approach was correct. So, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.153 )= ~0.391.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the RV analysis.

Alternative approach: Perhaps instead of using the RV shifts, I can use the Doppler shift method to find the mass function and then find a1 and a2.

Wait, the RV method gives the mass function, which is:

f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i )/( (M_* + M_p )^2 )

But since M_p << M_*, f(M) ≈ (M_p^3 sin^3 i )/( M_*^2 )

But without knowing sin i, we can't find the exact mass. However, since both planets are orbiting the same star, if we assume that i is the same for both (which is likely, but we don't know), then the ratio of the mass functions would be (M1^3 )/( M2^3 )

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for us to use the RV velocities to find the ratio of a1 and a2 without considering the mass.

Wait, the velocities are given as shifts in the forbidden line. So, using Doppler shift formula, K = v = (delta lambda / lambda ) * c

So, for Planet1: K1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * 3e5 km/s ≈ (0.03/6300)*3e5 = 1.4286 m/s

Similarly, K2=0.04/6300 *3e5 = ~1.9048 m/s.

So, the velocities are 1.4286 m/s and 1.9048 m/s.

But from the RV method, K is given by:

K = (v )= ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (a (1 - e² ) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: Using the fact that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v )= ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (a )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

But again, without knowing P, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law to relate P and a.

Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_* + M_p ) )

Assuming M_p << M_*, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So, P ≈ sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) )

But substituting this into K's formula:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

Substituting P:

= [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) ) )^(1/3 )

Hmm, this might be manageable.

Let me compute the second part:

(2 pi ) / ( (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) )

= (2 pi ) / ( sqrt(4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* )) )

= (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi sqrt( a^3/( G M_* ) ) )

= 1/( sqrt( a^3/( G M_* ) ) )

= sqrt( G M_* / a^3 )

So, K becomes:

= [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * [ ( G M_* / a^3 )^(1/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify exponents:

= [ G M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * [ G M_* / a^3 ]^(1/6 )

= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(2/9) a^(1/9) ) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 )

Combine like terms:

G exponents: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.

M_* exponents: -2/9 + 1/6. Let's compute:

-2/9 = -4/18, 1/6 =3/18. So total: (-4 +3)/18 = -1/18.

a exponents: -1/9 -1/2 = - (2/18 + 9/18 )= -11/18.

So,

K= G^(1/2) * M_p^(1/3) * M_*^(-1/18) * a^(-11/18 )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think of K in terms of a.

But perhaps this isn't the best use of time. Let me think of an alternative approach.

Perhaps the question wants us to use the ratio of the velocities to find the ratio of the masses and distances, but with the given data, it's leading me to a T_eq ratio that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to test that the equilibrium temperature ratio is roughly similar to the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio, which I've calculated as approximately 0.55, which is closest to option C) ~0.53.

But perhaps I made a mistake in that earlier approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the distance ratio using the RV data, but I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me try to find a1 and a2.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v )= ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So, P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) ]^(1/2 )

Substituting P into K:

K = ( (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3 ) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2 pi / [ (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) ] )^(1/3 )

Simplify the second term:

(2 pi ) / [ (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_* ))^(1/2 ) ]

= (2 pi ) / [ (2 pi )^(1) a^(3/2 ) (G M_* )^(-1/2 ) ) ) ]

= (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi a^(3/2) (G M_* )^(-1/2) )

= 1/( a^(3/2) (G M_* )^(-1/2) )

= ( G M_* )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 )

So, the entire expression for K becomes:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_*^(2/3 ) a^(1/3 )) ]^(1/3 ) * [ ( G M_* )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_*^(2/9 ) a^(1/9 ) ) ) ] * [ ( G M_* )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 ) )

Combine terms:

G: (1/3) + (1/6) )= 1/2

M_*: ( -2/9 ) + (1/6 ) ) → Convert to common denominator of 18: -4/18 +3/18 = -1/18.

a: ( -1/9 ) + (-1/2 ) ) → - (2/18 +9/18 )= -11/18.

So,

K= G^(1/2 ) * M_p^(1/3 ) * M_*^(-1/18 ) * a^(-11/18 )

Now, for Planet1 and Planet2, we have:

K1/K2 = [ ( G^(1/2 ) * M1^(1/3 ) * M_*^(-1/18 ) * a1^(-11/18 ) ) ) ] / [ same for K2 ]

= ( M1^(1/3 ) / M2^(1/3 ) ) * ( a2^(11/18 ) / a1^(11/18 ) )

= ( (M1/M2 )^(1/3 ) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(11/18 ) )

So, K1/K2 = ( (M1/M2 )^(1/3 ) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(11/18 ) )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75, M1=7, M2=5.

So,

0.75 = (7/5 )^(1/3 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(11/18 )

Compute (7/5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ (1.4 )^(0.333 ) ≈1.12.

So,

0.75 = 1.12 * ( a2/a1 )^(11/18 )

Divide both sides by 1.12:

0.75 /1.12 ≈0.67.

So,

( a2/a1 )^(11/18 ) = 0.67.

Raise both sides to the power of 18/11:

a2/a1 = (0.67 )^(18/11 )

Let me compute 0.67^(18/11 ).

First, natural log of 0.67 is approx -0.4005.

Multiply by (18/11 )=1.6364: -0.4005 *1.6364≈-0.655.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.655 )≈0.518.

So, a2/a1≈0.518.

So, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.518 ) ≈0.72.

Hmm, that's closer to option A (0.98) or D (1.05), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Compute ln(0.67 )= approximately -0.40046.

Multiply by 18/11 =1.63636.

-0.40046 *1.63636≈-0.655.

e^-0.655≈0.518.

So, a2/a1=0.518.

So, T_eq1= T_eq2 * sqrt(0.518 )= T_eq2 * 0.72.

So, ratio is ~0.72.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, the problem is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is meant to be approximately 0.53, which is option C.

But earlier, using the K^3 approach gave a ratio of 0.55, which is close to 0.53. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

I'm probably overcomplicating it. The correct approach is to find the ratio of a's using K1/K2 and then take the square root for the temperature ratio.

But the initial approach gave a ratio of 0.55, which is near option C (~0.53).

So I'll go with option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to determine the ratio of the orbital distances (\(a_2/a_1\)).

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Shifts to Orbital Distances
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \(a_2/a_1\):

\[
\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)^3
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Known Values
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)

The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Substituting into the formula for \(a_2/a_1\):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(0.75 \cdot \frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(0.75 \cdot 0.714\right)^3 \approx (0.5357)^3 \approx 0.153
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.153} \approx 0.391
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated ratio (\(T_{\text{eq1}}/T_{\text{eq2}} \approx 0.391\)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) ~0.53**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Final Answer
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
