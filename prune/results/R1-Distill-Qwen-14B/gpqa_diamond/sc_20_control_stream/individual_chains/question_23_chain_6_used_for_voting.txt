Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some basics about reactions with alkenes and such.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction is probably proceeding, and two new products formed.

Let me parse the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking that down: the main chain is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we number from the end with the oxygen). The substituents on the butenyl group are two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure is: the oxygen is attached to the benzene ring, then a chain that's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me visualize it. The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- with the substituents on the second carbon.

Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH, but that's not correct because butenyl would have four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: the group is (CH2)2C(CH3)2 connected via a double bond. Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. But wait, that would make it CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But the substituents are on the second carbon, which is the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

The butenyl group is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, the numbering is from the end where the substituent is. Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH₂CH₂CH=CH- where the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that doesn't make sense because butenyl is four carbons. Let's correct that.

No, butenyl is four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂, but that's but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂? No, because but has four carbons. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between positions 3 and 4. So, structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between 3 and 4. So it's CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-? No, wait, but the numbering is from the end where the substituent is attached. So the substituent is on C1, then the chain is C1 (attached to O), C2, C3, C4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ which can't have a double bond there because that would make it a four-carbon chain with a triple bond? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. The main chain is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at position 3. So the substituent is on the first carbon, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be:

O
|
O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂-CH₂?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂, with the substituents on the second carbon. Wait, but the butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH- with the substituents on the second carbon? Or is but-3-en-1-yl CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: for but-3-en-1-yl, the substituent is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between 3 and 4. But that's not possible because that would only be three carbons from 1 to 4. Wait, but but is four carbons. So, for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with the double bond between C3 and C4. So it's CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl? Hmm, maybe I should check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is better depicted as:

The group is OCH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂? But with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-O-benzene? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the structure is this: the oxygen is connected to a benzene ring. Then, the substituent is a butenyl group, which is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy.

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean that the substituent is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So, the substituent is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain, with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂, with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the substituent is CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂, but wait, the structure would have the double bond between the third and fourth carbons, so it's CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth. That would make it CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth, but that would require that the third carbon is the one with the CH₂. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH₂)₂C(CH3)₂-CH₂-O-benzene, but with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as this: the butenyl group is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, no, because the question says but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to just think about the reaction. The starting material is an ether with a butenyl group substituted with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So, the structure is something like O-benzene-CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
|
Benzene-O-CH₂-CH(CH(CH3)₂)-CH₂-CH₂?

No, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Anyway, the reaction is with HBr. So, HBr is a typical reagent for addition reactions, especially to alkenes. So, the starting material is an ether with an allylic substituent. Wait, because the substituent is on the second carbon of the butenyl group.

Wait, another thought: HBr can also undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage of certain ethers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr would add to the double bond in an addition reaction, but in this case, the starting material is an allyl ether.

So, the reaction is between HBr and an allyl ether. What usually happens when an allyl ether reacts with HBr? I remember that allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. For example, HBr can protonate the ether oxygen, making it more electrophilic, leading to attack by the bromide ion.

But wait, in allyl ethers, the structure is such that the oxygen is connected to an allyl group. So, when HBr is added, it can lead to the formation of a carbocation at the allylic position. Due to the stability of the allyl carbocation, the reaction might proceed through a carbocation intermediate.

Alternatively, HBr could add across the double bond, leading to a bromoalkene, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage. For example, in the case of an epoxide, HBr would open it, but that's not the case here. For allyl ethers, HBr can cause cleavage. Let me think: I remember that when an allyl ether is treated with a strong acid like HBr, it can lead to the formation of a carbocation, which is resonance-stabilized. Then, water (or another nucleophile) could attack, leading to cleavage.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is with HBr, which is a source of H+ and Br-. So, maybe the mechanism is as follows: the acid (HBr) protonates the oxygen of the ether, making it a better leaving group. Then, the oxygen leaves as a good leaving group (like an oxonium ion), forming a carbocation. But in this case, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge would be on the adjacent carbon. Let me try to visualize: the oxygen is connected to the benzene and to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, the adjacent carbon (C2?) would form a carbocation.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's number the butenyl group as follows: position 1 is attached to the oxygen. Position 2 has two methyl groups. Then, positions 3 and 4 have the double bond.

So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH₂-CH₂, but wait, wait. No, but-3-en-1-yl would be O-CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH(CH3)₂)-CH₂-CH₂, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, which would make it O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, but that doesn't seem to fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's proceed.

When the ether oxygen is protonated, it leaves, leading to a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. So, the adjacent carbon is the one bearing two methyl groups. So, the carbocation would be on the CH2 group next to the oxygen, but that's adjacent to the CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, no, if the oxygen is on C1 and the CH(CH3)2 is on C2, then when the O leaves, the positive charge would be on C2, which is CH(CH3)2. But that can't form a stable carbocation because it's a tertiary carbocation. Wait, C2 would have two methyl groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, C1 is the one attached to O, then C2 has two methyl groups, C3 has a double bond, and C4 is a CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but that's not possible because it's a four-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps it's O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge is on C2, which has two methyl groups attached. That would make a tertiary carbocation, which is pretty stable.

Once the carbocation forms, where can the Br- attack? It can attack either at the same carbon (C2) or possibly the adjacent carbons. Wait, but in allyl systems, the carbocation can be stabilized through resonance.

Wait, when the carbocation forms on C2, perhaps it's a tertiary carbocation, but the adjacent C3 is part of a double bond. So, the structure after loss of O- would be a carbocation on C2, but C3 and C4 are double-bonded. So, maybe the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C+(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction again. The starting material is an allyl ether. When treated with HBr, it undergoes cleavage. The reaction of allyl ethers with HBr typically leads to the formation of a bromide and a carbonyl compound. For example, the cleavage would break the ether into two products: one would be a bromide, and the other would be a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the substitution.

Wait, I think the general reaction is: R-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (with a double bond) + HBr → R-OH + Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage occurs at the double bond.

Wait, another angle: allyl ethers react with HBr to form allylic bromides. So, HBr adds across the double bond, but in a way that forms a bromoalkane. Alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed addition, leading to a di-substituted alkyl bromide.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is between HBr and an allyl ether. The possible products would depend on where the cleavage or addition occurs.

Wait, let me think of specific examples. In the acid-catalyzed cleavage of allyl ethers, the reaction typically proceeds through the formation of a carbocation, which can undergo hydride shifts or other rearrangements. Then, bromide ion attacks, leading to cleavage.

For example, if you have an allyl ether like CH2=CHCH2-O-R, treatment with HBr can lead to the formation of R-OH and CH2Br-CH2-CH2Br? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it leads to the formation of R-OH and an allyl bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br- attacks the carbocation, leading to bromide formation. Let me think: the carbocation forms on C2 (if the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the carbocation is at C3, which is adjacent to the double bond, allowing for resonance stabilization.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the butenyl group as CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the O leaves, the positive charge would be on C1, which is CH2. But that's a primary carbocation, which is not very stable. So maybe the carbocation shifts to a more stable position.

Wait, perhaps the initial carbocation is on C1 (primary), which is unstable, so it undergoes a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation elsewhere. For example, from C1 to C2. If C2 has two methyl groups, then the carbocation would be on C2, which is tertiary and more stable.

So, the carbocation would be on C2: O-benzene-CH2-C+ (CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2. But the double bond is between C3 and C4. Alternatively, maybe the carbocation is on C3, which is part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the double bond allows for resonance. So, the carbocation could be delocalized. Let's consider that when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge could be on C2 or C3, depending on resonance.

Wait, the structure after losing the oxygen would be CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, perhaps the carbocation can form at C3, which is part of the double bond. So, the structure would be CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a positive charge on C3.

Wait, but in that case, the carbocation would be on C3, which is adjacent to the double bond. So, the structure is CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a positive charge on C3.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation can delocalize into the double bond, making it allylic. So, the positive charge could be on C3 or C4, allowing for resonance stabilization.

In that case, when bromide ion attacks, it can do so at either C3 or C4, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, the Br- could attack the carbocation at C3 or C4, leading to two different bromides.

So, if the bromide attacks at C3, the product would be a bromide at that position. If it attacks at C4, the product would be a different bromide.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge is on C2, which is CH(CH3)₂. Then, the Br- can attack either at C2 or perhaps at C3 or C4, depending on carbocation stability.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation can rearrange. If the initial carbocation is on C2 (tertiary), then Br- can attack there, leading to substitution at that position. Alternatively, if the carbocation can shift to C3, which is part of the double bond, and thus can delocalize the charge, making it more stable, then Br- can attack either C2 or C3.

So, the possible products would be either substitution at C2 or addition at C3.

Wait, but the question states that two new spots appeared on the TLC. So, the reaction has two products. That suggests two different products formed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. These look like the phenol would have an alkyl group attached. So, this would imply that the ether broke, and the product is a phenol. But how? Because HBr is an acid, maybe the oxygen is protonated, leaving as Br- and forming a phenol. But in that case, would the other part form an alkyl bromide? Then, maybe two bromides formed, but I'm not sure.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, so one product is a brominated ether, and the other is an allyl ether with a different structure. Maybe this is due to allylic bromination or some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts position.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures seem more complex, involving rings, which I'm not sure how they'd form from this reaction.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, two brominated ethers, with Br at position 4 and 3 respectively. So, the bromide would have been added to the butoxy group at different positions.

Hmm. So, let's think again about the reaction mechanism.

The starting material is an allyl ether. When treated with HBr, the oxygen is protonated, making it a good leaving group. The O leaves, forming a carbocation adjacent to the oxygen. The carbocation can be at C2 (tertiary) or possibly undergo a hydride shift or some other rearrangement.

If the carbocation is at C2, then Br- can attack there, leading to substitution at C2. So, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But wait, the initial substituent is 2,2-dimethylbutenyl, so substitution at C2 would make it 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy? Or perhaps substitution at C3 or C4.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism leads to bromide attack at C3, leading to 3-bromo substitution. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Another possibility is that the double bond could shift during the reaction. For example, if the carbocation forms at C2, which is adjacent to C3, which is part of a double bond, the double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, let's imagine that. The initial carbocation is at C2 (tertiary), but adjacent to a double bond (C3-C4). So, the positive charge could delocalize into the double bond, perhaps moving the double bond to C2-C3. So, the structure becomes CH2+-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond now between C2 and C3. So, the carbocation is now at C3, which is part of the double bond, making it allylic and more stable.

In that case, bromide could attack either at C2 or C3. If it attacks at C3, which is now part of the double bond, then the product would have Br at C3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs on the carbocation, leading to substitution at C2. Then, the other product would involve a rearrangement of the double bond, perhaps leading to a different structure.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide and cleavage of the ether. For example, the ether oxygen could break, releasing the benzene ring as phenol (with the loss of the butenyl group), and the butenyl part could form a bromide. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is hydration. Oh wait, no, HBr is used with H2O as a workup, but in this case, it's just HBr. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of HBr to the double bond. But in that case, the product would be a bromoalkene, but the question says two new spots appeared, suggesting two products.

Wait, another approach: if the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene, upon reaction with HBr, perhaps the double bond undergoes hydrohalogenation, leading to two possible products based on where the Br adds.

So, the possible products would be the bromide adding to either the same carbon (leading to a more substituted double bond) or the less substituted.

But wait, in the case of allyl ethers, the addition of HBr could lead to different regiochemistry based on carbocation stability.

Wait, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the substituent is on C2, adding HBr could lead to two possible products depending on the attack of Br-.

Wait, perhaps the Br adds to C3, leading to a secondary bromide, or adds to C4, leading to a primary bromide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in two different regioisomers due to the possibility of carbocation rearrangement.

Wait, if the carbocation forms on C2 (tertiary), then the Br- could attack there, leading to substitution at C2. Alternatively, if the carbocation can shift to C3, making it allylic and more stable, then the Br- could attack at C3, leading to a different product.

So, the two products would be substitution at C2 and substitution at C3.

Looking at the options, option D suggests two brominated ether products with Br at position 3 and 4. Option B suggests an ether with Br at 4 and an allyl ether with a different structure.

Option B's first product is (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which would mean substitution at C4. The second product is ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, which suggests that the double bond has shifted to between C2 and C3, with methyl groups on C2 and C3.

That could happen if the initial carbocation formed at C2, shifted the double bond, leading to a different structure. So, perhaps the double bond shifted, leading to a new allyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial addition of HBr to the double bond leads to two different products based on the position of addition.

Wait, another possibility is that the double bond could undergo acid-catalyzed rearrangement, such as a hydride shift, leading to a different structure. So, perhaps the double bond shifts from C3-C4 to C2-C3, leading to the formation of a new structure.

In that case, the reaction could produce two products: one where the Br is added to the original position (e.g., C4) and another where the double bond has shifted, leading to a different structure.

Alternatively, the initial reaction could proceed via two different pathways: one where the Br adds to the same side (resulting in a bromide at C3 or C4) and another where the double bond shifts, leading to a new structure.

Looking at the options again, option D has two brominated ethers, while option B has one brominated ether and a new allyl ether.

So, if the reaction leads to bromide substitution at C4 and C3, then option D would be the answer. Alternatively, if the reaction leads to a new structure due to double bond shift, option B would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the possibilities.

If the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage, then perhaps the products are a phenol and a bromide. But the options don't seem to show that. For example, option A has two phenols, which would require the butenyl group to split into two parts, each forming a phenol. But that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide replaces the oxygen. But that would require a good leaving group, which the oxygen is not, unless it's protonated.

Wait, when the ether oxygen is protonated, it becomes a better leaving group, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbocation. Then, the Br- can attack the carbocation, leading to substitution. So, the product would be a bromide at that position.

In this case, the starting material is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the O leaves, the positive charge is on C2 (tertiary), and Br- can attack there, leading to substitution at C2. Thus, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

But then, why would there be a second product? Unless the carbocation can rearrange.

If the initial carbocation is on C2, perhaps it can shift to C3, which is part of the double bond, leading to a more stable allylic carbocation. So, the positive charge could be delocalized between C2 and C3, making it more stable. Then, Br- could attack either C2 or C3, leading to two different products.

If Br- attacks C2, the product would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene (since the substitution would be on C3 of the original chain). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the numbering here.

Alternatively, if the Br- attacks C3, which is now part of the double bond (shifted to C2-C3), the product would be (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, perhaps.

Wait, maybe let me think of the butenyl group as follows:

Positions: 1 (O attached), 2 (two methyl groups), 3 (double bond start), 4 (double bond end).

So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4.

When O leaves, C2 has the positive charge. Then, the double bond could shift, so that the carbocation is at C3, which is now part of a new double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the structure would then be O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a new double bond between C2 and C3, and a positive charge on C3.

In that case, the Br- could attack either C2 or C3.

Wait, but if the double bond shifts to C2-C3, then the structure becomes O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a positive charge on C3.

Then, Br- could attack at C3, leading to substitution at C3, or perhaps attack at C2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br- attacks at C3, leading to substitution there, and the double bond remains between C2 and C3.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structures.

Looking at the options, option D has (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, that implies substitution at C3 and C4.

Alternatively, option B has (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and an allyl ether with the double bond now between C2 and C3.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to two products: one where the Br is added at C4, and another where the double bond shifts, leading to a new structure.

In that case, the first product would be (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, and the second product would be ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So, this would match option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two bromides at different positions, which would match option D.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a bromide and a di-substituted product. But I'm not entirely certain.

Another thought: when the carbocation forms, it could undergo a hydride shift, leading to a more stable carbocation. If the initial carbocation is on C2 (tertiary), but adjacent to C3, which is part of a double bond, perhaps the carbocation can shift to C3, forming an allylic carbocation, which is more stable.

So, the Br- would attack at C3, leading to substitution there, but the double bond would shift to between C2 and C3, making the structure ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

Wait, no, because substitution at C3 would affect the structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, the carbocation at C3 (allylic) could lead to the formation of a new structure where the double bond has shifted.

So, the two products would be:

1. (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene: substitution at C4.

Wait, why C4? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs at C3, but that leads to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial carbocation is on C2, and the Br- attacks there, leading to substitution at C2, which would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide attacks the carbocation, leading to substitution at C3, which would be (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the numbering. Let me clarify the positions.

The butenyl group is numbered from the oxygen:

1: attached to O.

2: next carbon, with two methyl groups.

3 and 4: double bond between them.

So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge is on C2.

If Br- attacks C2, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But that doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, the carbocation could shift to C3, making the structure have a double bond between C2 and C3, and a positive charge on C3. Then, Br- could attack C3, leading to substitution there.

So, the structure would be O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CHBr-CH2, but that would be a bromide at C3. But numbering would make that C4?

Wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think of it differently.

Original structure: O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, with double bond between C3 and C4.

After losing O, positive charge at C2.

If the double bond shifts to C2 and C3, the structure becomes O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and positive charge on C3.

Then, Br- can attack at C3, leading to substitution at C3. The product would be O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CHBr-CH2, but the double bond is now between C2 and C3.

Wait, but that would make the structure ((2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond remains between C3 and C4, and the substitution occurs at C3. So, the product would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

But looking at the options, option D has (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, two bromides at different positions.

But how would that happen? If the carbocation is at C2, and Br- attacks there, it would lead to substitution at C2, but I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbocation can form at C3 and C4, leading to substitution at those positions.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I think option D is plausible, as it suggests two bromides at different positions on the butoxy group.

Alternatively, option B could be correct if the reaction leads to a bromide and a shifted double bond.

But given that the starting material is a but-3-en-1-yl group, and after reaction, two products form, perhaps due to substitution at different carbons, I'm more inclined towards option D.

Wait, another thought: when HBr adds to a double bond, it can lead to two products based on where the Br adds. For example, in an allylic substitution, the Br could add to either end of the double bond, leading to two different products.

But in the original structure, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, adding HBr would give either 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbut-1-en-1-yl or 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbut-1-en-1-yl.

Wait, but those would be bromoalkenes, but the options don't directly show that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at C3 and C4, as in option D.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with option D, as it shows two brominated ether products, which would result from substitution at C3 and C4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether, where the butenyl group has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and two methyl groups on carbon 2. The reaction mechanism likely proceeds through the protonation of the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. This results in the formation of a carbocation at carbon 2, which is stabilized by the adjacent double bond through resonance. 

The carbocation can rearrange or remain in place, allowing bromide ion (Br⁻) to attack at different positions. This leads to the formation of two products. The first product is a brominated ether with Br at position 4, while the second product is a brominated ether with Br at position 3. These two products correspond to the structures described in option D.

Option A suggests phenol derivatives, which is inconsistent with the reaction conditions and the starting material. Option B proposes one brominated ether and a new allyl ether, which does not align with the expected substitution products. Option C involves complex ring structures that are unlikely to form under these reaction conditions. Therefore, the most plausible answer is option D, which correctly accounts for the formation of two brominated ether products.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some basics about reactions with alkenes and such.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction is probably proceeding, and two new products formed.

Let me parse the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking that down: the main chain is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we number from the end with the oxygen). The substituents on the butenyl group are two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure is: the oxygen is attached to the benzene ring, then a chain that's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me visualize it. The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- with the substituents on the second carbon.

Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH, but that's not correct because butenyl would have four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: the group is (CH2)2C(CH3)2 connected via a double bond. Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. But wait, that would make it CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But the substituents are on the second carbon, which is the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

The butenyl group is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, the numbering is from the end where the substituent is. Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH₂CH₂CH=CH- where the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that doesn't make sense because butenyl is four carbons. Let's correct that.

No, butenyl is four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂, but that's but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂? No, because but has four carbons. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between positions 3 and 4. So, structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between 3 and 4. So it's CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-? No, wait, but the numbering is from the end where the substituent is attached. So the substituent is on C1, then the chain is C1 (attached to O), C2, C3, C4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ which can't have a double bond there because that would make it a four-carbon chain with a triple bond? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. The main chain is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at position 3. So the substituent is on the first carbon, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be:

O
|
O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂-CH₂?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂, with the substituents on the second carbon. Wait, but the butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH- with the substituents on the second carbon? Or is but-3-en-1-yl CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: for but-3-en-1-yl, the substituent is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between 3 and 4. But that's not possible because that would only be three carbons from 1 to 4. Wait, but but is four carbons. So, for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with the double bond between C3 and C4. So it's CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl? Hmm, maybe I should check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is better depicted as:

The group is OCH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂? But with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-O-benzene? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the structure is this: the oxygen is connected to a benzene ring. Then, the substituent is a butenyl group, which is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy.

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean that the substituent is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So, the substituent is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain, with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂, with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the substituent is CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂, but wait, the structure would have the double bond between the third and fourth carbons, so it's CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth. That would make it CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth, but that would require that the third carbon is the one with the CH₂. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH₂)₂C(CH3)₂-CH₂-O-benzene, but with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as this: the butenyl group is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, no, because the question says but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to just think about the reaction. The starting material is an ether with a butenyl group substituted with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So, the structure is something like O-benzene-CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
|
Benzene-O-CH₂-CH(CH(CH3)₂)-CH₂-CH₂?

No, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Anyway, the reaction is with HBr. So, HBr is a typical reagent for addition reactions, especially to alkenes. So, the starting material is an ether with an allylic substituent. Wait, because the substituent is on the second carbon of the butenyl group.

Wait, another thought: HBr can also undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage of certain ethers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr would add to the double bond in an addition reaction, but in this case, the starting material is an allyl ether.

So, the reaction is between HBr and an allyl ether. What usually happens when an allyl ether reacts with HBr? I remember that allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. For example, HBr can protonate the ether oxygen, making it more electrophilic, leading to attack by the bromide ion.

But wait, in allyl ethers, the structure is such that the oxygen is connected to an allyl group. So, when HBr is added, it can lead to the formation of a carbocation at the allylic position. Due to the stability of the allyl carbocation, the reaction might proceed through a carbocation intermediate.

Alternatively, HBr could add across the double bond, leading to a bromoalkene, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage. For example, in the case of an epoxide, HBr would open it, but that's not the case here. For allyl ethers, HBr can cause cleavage. Let me think: I remember that when an allyl ether is treated with a strong acid like HBr, it can lead to the formation of a carbocation, which is resonance-stabilized. Then, water (or another nucleophile) could attack, leading to cleavage.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is with HBr, which is a source of H+ and Br-. So, maybe the mechanism is as follows: the acid (HBr) protonates the oxygen of the ether, making it a better leaving group. Then, the oxygen leaves as a good leaving group (like an oxonium ion), forming a carbocation. But in this case, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge would be on the adjacent carbon. Let me try to visualize: the oxygen is connected to the benzene and to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, the adjacent carbon (C2?) would form a carbocation.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's number the butenyl group as follows: position 1 is attached to the oxygen. Position 2 has two methyl groups. Then, positions 3 and 4 have the double bond.

So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH₂-CH₂, but wait, wait. No, but-3-en-1-yl would be O-CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH(CH3)₂)-CH₂-CH₂, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, which would make it O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, but that doesn't seem to fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's proceed.

When the ether oxygen is protonated, it leaves, leading to a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. So, the adjacent carbon is the one bearing two methyl groups. So, the carbocation would be on the CH2 group next to the oxygen, but that's adjacent to the CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, no, if the oxygen is on C1 and the CH(CH3)2 is on C2, then when the O leaves, the positive charge would be on C2, which is CH(CH3)2. But that can't form a stable carbocation because it's a tertiary carbocation. Wait, C2 would have two methyl groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, C1 is the one attached to O, then C2 has two methyl groups, C3 has a double bond, and C4 is a CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but that's not possible because it's a four-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps it's O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge is on C2, which has two methyl groups attached. That would make a tertiary carbocation, which is pretty stable.

Once the carbocation forms, where can the Br- attack? It can attack either at the same carbon (C2) or possibly the adjacent carbons. Wait, but in allyl systems, the carbocation can be stabilized through resonance.

Wait, when the carbocation forms on C2, perhaps it's a tertiary carbocation, but the adjacent C3 is part of a double bond. So, the structure after loss of O- would be a carbocation on C2, but C3 and C4 are double-bonded. So, maybe the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C+(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction again. The starting material is an allyl ether. When treated with HBr, it undergoes cleavage. The reaction of allyl ethers with HBr typically leads to the formation of a bromide and a carbonyl compound. For example, the cleavage would break the ether into two products: one would be a bromide, and the other would be a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the substitution.

Wait, I think the general reaction is: R-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (with a double bond) + HBr → R-OH + Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage occurs at the double bond.

Wait, another angle: allyl ethers react with HBr to form allylic bromides. So, HBr adds across the double bond, but in a way that forms a bromoalkane. Alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed addition, leading to a di-substituted alkyl bromide.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is between HBr and an allyl ether. The possible products would depend on where the cleavage or addition occurs.

Wait, let me think of specific examples. In the acid-catalyzed cleavage of allyl ethers, the reaction typically proceeds through the formation of a carbocation, which can undergo hydride shifts or other rearrangements. Then, bromide ion attacks, leading to cleavage.

For example, if you have an allyl ether like CH2=CHCH2-O-R, treatment with HBr can lead to the formation of R-OH and CH2Br-CH2-CH2Br? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it leads to the formation of R-OH and an allyl bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br- attacks the carbocation, leading to bromide formation. Let me think: the carbocation forms on C2 (if the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the carbocation is at C3, which is adjacent to the double bond, allowing for resonance stabilization.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the butenyl group as CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the O leaves, the positive charge would be on C1, which is CH2. But that's a primary carbocation, which is not very stable. So maybe the carbocation shifts to a more stable position.

Wait, perhaps the initial carbocation is on C1 (primary), which is unstable, so it undergoes a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation elsewhere. For example, from C1 to C2. If C2 has two methyl groups, then the carbocation would be on C2, which is tertiary and more stable.

So, the carbocation would be on C2: O-benzene-CH2-C+ (CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2. But the double bond is between C3 and C4. Alternatively, maybe the carbocation is on C3, which is part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the double bond allows for resonance. So, the carbocation could be delocalized. Let's consider that when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge could be on C2 or C3, depending on resonance.

Wait, the structure after losing the oxygen would be CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, perhaps the carbocation can form at C3, which is part of the double bond. So, the structure would be CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a positive charge on C3.

Wait, but in that case, the carbocation would be on C3, which is adjacent to the double bond. So, the structure is CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a positive charge on C3.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation can delocalize into the double bond, making it allylic. So, the positive charge could be on C3 or C4, allowing for resonance stabilization.

In that case, when bromide ion attacks, it can do so at either C3 or C4, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, the Br- could attack the carbocation at C3 or C4, leading to two different bromides.

So, if the bromide attacks at C3, the product would be a bromide at that position. If it attacks at C4, the product would be a different bromide.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge is on C2, which is CH(CH3)₂. Then, the Br- can attack either at C2 or perhaps at C3 or C4, depending on carbocation stability.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation can rearrange. If the initial carbocation is on C2 (tertiary), then Br- can attack there, leading to substitution at that position. Alternatively, if the carbocation can shift to C3, which is part of the double bond, and thus can delocalize the charge, making it more stable, then Br- can attack either C2 or C3.

So, the possible products would be either substitution at C2 or addition at C3.

Wait, but the question states that two new spots appeared on the TLC. So, the reaction has two products. That suggests two different products formed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. These look like the phenol would have an alkyl group attached. So, this would imply that the ether broke, and the product is a phenol. But how? Because HBr is an acid, maybe the oxygen is protonated, leaving as Br- and forming a phenol. But in that case, would the other part form an alkyl bromide? Then, maybe two bromides formed, but I'm not sure.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, so one product is a brominated ether, and the other is an allyl ether with a different structure. Maybe this is due to allylic bromination or some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts position.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures seem more complex, involving rings, which I'm not sure how they'd form from this reaction.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, two brominated ethers, with Br at position 4 and 3 respectively. So, the bromide would have been added to the butoxy group at different positions.

Hmm. So, let's think again about the reaction mechanism.

The starting material is an allyl ether. When treated with HBr, the oxygen is protonated, making it a good leaving group. The O leaves, forming a carbocation adjacent to the oxygen. The carbocation can be at C2 (tertiary) or possibly undergo a hydride shift or some other rearrangement.

If the carbocation is at C2, then Br- can attack there, leading to substitution at C2. So, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But wait, the initial substituent is 2,2-dimethylbutenyl, so substitution at C2 would make it 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy? Or perhaps substitution at C3 or C4.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism leads to bromide attack at C3, leading to 3-bromo substitution. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Another possibility is that the double bond could shift during the reaction. For example, if the carbocation forms at C2, which is adjacent to C3, which is part of a double bond, the double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, let's imagine that. The initial carbocation is at C2 (tertiary), but adjacent to a double bond (C3-C4). So, the positive charge could delocalize into the double bond, perhaps moving the double bond to C2-C3. So, the structure becomes CH2+-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond now between C2 and C3. So, the carbocation is now at C3, which is part of the double bond, making it allylic and more stable.

In that case, bromide could attack either at C2 or C3. If it attacks at C3, which is now part of the double bond, then the product would have Br at C3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs on the carbocation, leading to substitution at C2. Then, the other product would involve a rearrangement of the double bond, perhaps leading to a different structure.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide and cleavage of the ether. For example, the ether oxygen could break, releasing the benzene ring as phenol (with the loss of the butenyl group), and the butenyl part could form a bromide. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is hydration. Oh wait, no, HBr is used with H2O as a workup, but in this case, it's just HBr. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of HBr to the double bond. But in that case, the product would be a bromoalkene, but the question says two new spots appeared, suggesting two products.

Wait, another approach: if the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene, upon reaction with HBr, perhaps the double bond undergoes hydrohalogenation, leading to two possible products based on where the Br adds.

So, the possible products would be the bromide adding to either the same carbon (leading to a more substituted double bond) or the less substituted.

But wait, in the case of allyl ethers, the addition of HBr could lead to different regiochemistry based on carbocation stability.

Wait, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the substituent is on C2, adding HBr could lead to two possible products depending on the attack of Br-.

Wait, perhaps the Br adds to C3, leading to a secondary bromide, or adds to C4, leading to a primary bromide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in two different regioisomers due to the possibility of carbocation rearrangement.

Wait, if the carbocation forms on C2 (tertiary), then the Br- could attack there, leading to substitution at C2. Alternatively, if the carbocation can shift to C3, making it allylic and more stable, then the Br- could attack at C3, leading to a different product.

So, the two products would be substitution at C2 and substitution at C3.

Looking at the options, option D suggests two brominated ether products with Br at position 3 and 4. Option B suggests an ether with Br at 4 and an allyl ether with a different structure.

Option B's first product is (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which would mean substitution at C4. The second product is ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, which suggests that the double bond has shifted to between C2 and C3, with methyl groups on C2 and C3.

That could happen if the initial carbocation formed at C2, shifted the double bond, leading to a different structure. So, perhaps the double bond shifted, leading to a new allyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial addition of HBr to the double bond leads to two different products based on the position of addition.

Wait, another possibility is that the double bond could undergo acid-catalyzed rearrangement, such as a hydride shift, leading to a different structure. So, perhaps the double bond shifts from C3-C4 to C2-C3, leading to the formation of a new structure.

In that case, the reaction could produce two products: one where the Br is added to the original position (e.g., C4) and another where the double bond has shifted, leading to a different structure.

Alternatively, the initial reaction could proceed via two different pathways: one where the Br adds to the same side (resulting in a bromide at C3 or C4) and another where the double bond shifts, leading to a new structure.

Looking at the options again, option D has two brominated ethers, while option B has one brominated ether and a new allyl ether.

So, if the reaction leads to bromide substitution at C4 and C3, then option D would be the answer. Alternatively, if the reaction leads to a new structure due to double bond shift, option B would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the possibilities.

If the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage, then perhaps the products are a phenol and a bromide. But the options don't seem to show that. For example, option A has two phenols, which would require the butenyl group to split into two parts, each forming a phenol. But that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide replaces the oxygen. But that would require a good leaving group, which the oxygen is not, unless it's protonated.

Wait, when the ether oxygen is protonated, it becomes a better leaving group, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbocation. Then, the Br- can attack the carbocation, leading to substitution. So, the product would be a bromide at that position.

In this case, the starting material is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when the O leaves, the positive charge is on C2 (tertiary), and Br- can attack there, leading to substitution at C2. Thus, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

But then, why would there be a second product? Unless the carbocation can rearrange.

If the initial carbocation is on C2, perhaps it can shift to C3, which is part of the double bond, leading to a more stable allylic carbocation. So, the positive charge could be delocalized between C2 and C3, making it more stable. Then, Br- could attack either C2 or C3, leading to two different products.

If Br- attacks C2, the product would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene (since the substitution would be on C3 of the original chain). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the numbering here.

Alternatively, if the Br- attacks C3, which is now part of the double bond (shifted to C2-C3), the product would be (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, perhaps.

Wait, maybe let me think of the butenyl group as follows:

Positions: 1 (O attached), 2 (two methyl groups), 3 (double bond start), 4 (double bond end).

So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4.

When O leaves, C2 has the positive charge. Then, the double bond could shift, so that the carbocation is at C3, which is now part of a new double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the structure would then be O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a new double bond between C2 and C3, and a positive charge on C3.

In that case, the Br- could attack either C2 or C3.

Wait, but if the double bond shifts to C2-C3, then the structure becomes O-benzene-CH₂-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a positive charge on C3.

Then, Br- could attack at C3, leading to substitution at C3, or perhaps attack at C2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br- attacks at C3, leading to substitution there, and the double bond remains between C2 and C3.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structures.

Looking at the options, option D has (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, that implies substitution at C3 and C4.

Alternatively, option B has (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and an allyl ether with the double bond now between C2 and C3.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to two products: one where the Br is added at C4, and another where the double bond shifts, leading to a new structure.

In that case, the first product would be (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, and the second product would be ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So, this would match option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two bromides at different positions, which would match option D.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a bromide and a di-substituted product. But I'm not entirely certain.

Another thought: when the carbocation forms, it could undergo a hydride shift, leading to a more stable carbocation. If the initial carbocation is on C2 (tertiary), but adjacent to C3, which is part of a double bond, perhaps the carbocation can shift to C3, forming an allylic carbocation, which is more stable.

So, the Br- would attack at C3, leading to substitution there, but the double bond would shift to between C2 and C3, making the structure ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

Wait, no, because substitution at C3 would affect the structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, the carbocation at C3 (allylic) could lead to the formation of a new structure where the double bond has shifted.

So, the two products would be:

1. (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene: substitution at C4.

Wait, why C4? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs at C3, but that leads to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial carbocation is on C2, and the Br- attacks there, leading to substitution at C2, which would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide attacks the carbocation, leading to substitution at C3, which would be (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the numbering. Let me clarify the positions.

The butenyl group is numbered from the oxygen:

1: attached to O.

2: next carbon, with two methyl groups.

3 and 4: double bond between them.

So, when the oxygen leaves, the positive charge is on C2.

If Br- attacks C2, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But that doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, the carbocation could shift to C3, making the structure have a double bond between C2 and C3, and a positive charge on C3. Then, Br- could attack C3, leading to substitution there.

So, the structure would be O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CHBr-CH2, but that would be a bromide at C3. But numbering would make that C4?

Wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think of it differently.

Original structure: O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, with double bond between C3 and C4.

After losing O, positive charge at C2.

If the double bond shifts to C2 and C3, the structure becomes O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH2, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and positive charge on C3.

Then, Br- can attack at C3, leading to substitution at C3. The product would be O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)₂-CHBr-CH2, but the double bond is now between C2 and C3.

Wait, but that would make the structure ((2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond remains between C3 and C4, and the substitution occurs at C3. So, the product would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

But looking at the options, option D has (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, two bromides at different positions.

But how would that happen? If the carbocation is at C2, and Br- attacks there, it would lead to substitution at C2, but I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbocation can form at C3 and C4, leading to substitution at those positions.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I think option D is plausible, as it suggests two bromides at different positions on the butoxy group.

Alternatively, option B could be correct if the reaction leads to a bromide and a shifted double bond.

But given that the starting material is a but-3-en-1-yl group, and after reaction, two products form, perhaps due to substitution at different carbons, I'm more inclined towards option D.

Wait, another thought: when HBr adds to a double bond, it can lead to two products based on where the Br adds. For example, in an allylic substitution, the Br could add to either end of the double bond, leading to two different products.

But in the original structure, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, adding HBr would give either 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbut-1-en-1-yl or 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbut-1-en-1-yl.

Wait, but those would be bromoalkenes, but the options don't directly show that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at C3 and C4, as in option D.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with option D, as it shows two brominated ether products, which would result from substitution at C3 and C4.


The reaction involves treating ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether, where the butenyl group has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and two methyl groups on carbon 2. The reaction mechanism likely proceeds through the protonation of the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. This results in the formation of a carbocation at carbon 2, which is stabilized by the adjacent double bond through resonance. 

The carbocation can rearrange or remain in place, allowing bromide ion (Br⁻) to attack at different positions. This leads to the formation of two products. The first product is a brominated ether with Br at position 4, while the second product is a brominated ether with Br at position 3. These two products correspond to the structures described in option D.

Option A suggests phenol derivatives, which is inconsistent with the reaction conditions and the starting material. Option B proposes one brominated ether and a new allyl ether, which does not align with the expected substitution products. Option C involves complex ring structures that are unlikely to form under these reaction conditions. Therefore, the most plausible answer is option D, which correctly accounts for the formation of two brominated ether products.

Answer: D
