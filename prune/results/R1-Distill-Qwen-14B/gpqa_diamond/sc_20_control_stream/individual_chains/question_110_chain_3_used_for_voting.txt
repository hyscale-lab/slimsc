Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. The key here is understanding the magnitude limits of each instrument.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 16. So, any star that's brighter (has a lower numerical magnitude) than these limits in both instruments would be detectable by both.

Wait, no—wait a minute. Oh, wait, actually, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag, so up to 16 mag. So any star that is brighter than 17 mag (i.e., magnitude ≤17) would be detectable by ESPRESSO, and any star brighter than 16 mag (i.e., magnitude ≤16) can be detected by HIRES.

So the star must be bright enough to be seen by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because if it's above 17, then ESPRESSO could see it but HIRES can't. Wait no: HIRES can see up to 16, so anything brighter than 16 (i.e., magnitude <16) can be seen by HIRES. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so anything brighter than 17 (i.e., magnitude ≤17) can be seen by ESPRESSO. So the overlapping range is magnitude ≤16—because any star with apparent V magnitude ≤16 is within both instruments' limits. So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 mag.

Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude depends on distance and intrinsic brightness. So the question gives each star's absolute magnitude and distance. Some have apparent magnitude given, others need to be calculated.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc away. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) it would have at 10 pc. So since it's at 10 pc, m = M =15.5. So apparent magnitude is 15.5. Now, wait, the question says that Star1 has an absolute magnitude of 15.5 and is at 10 pc, so m = 15.5. So m is 15.5. Which is less than 16, so it's detectable by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so it's within both. So Star1 can be detected by both? But wait, wait—wait, the question's description for Star1 says 'absolute V magnitude of 15.5' and is at 10 pc. So yes, m = M, so 15.5. So Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5. So that's within both instruments' ranges (since HIRES can go up to 16, and Star1 is 15.5 which is less than 16). So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. So m=16.5. Which is higher than 16. So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, Star2's m of 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so 16.5 is within, but since HIRES can't, Star2 is not a candidate.

Star3: Apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But wait, Star3 has E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. The note says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So I think that means extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic + extinction. Wait no. Wait, the apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log d - A_V? Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is m - M = 5 log (d/10) where d is distance in pc. But if there is extinction (A_V), then m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula without extinction is m = M + 5 log (d) - 5, since d is in parsecs. Alternatively, m = M + 5 log (d/10). So for Star3, which is at 15 pc, distance modulus is 5 log(15/10) = 5 log(1.5) ≈ 5 * 0.176 ≈ 0.88. So M is given as Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but wait no, wait. Wait, Star3 is given apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but that includes the extinction? Or not?

Wait, looking back: the problem states for Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". Wait, that might not make sense because apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. Or perhaps, the given apparent magnitude is the observed (which includes extinction), or the intrinsic?

Wait, no, the apparent magnitude is what is observed, which is affected by extinction. So, if a star has an intrinsic absolute magnitude M, and it's at distance d, the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0 = M + 5 log (d/10). But if there's extinction A_v, then the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_v.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter, so higher apparent magnitude. So if a star has an intrinsic brightness (m0), extinction makes it appear dimmer (so m = m0 + A_v).

So for Star3: The apparent magnitude given is 15.5, but wait, is that the observed magnitude (including extinction) or the intrinsic? Because the way the problem is worded, it's a bit confusing. Let me read Star3 again: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag".

Wait, E(B-V) is the color excess, which is related to the extinction A_v. So if the problem gives the apparent magnitude as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then that suggests that the apparent magnitude is already the observed (corrected for extinction?), but that's not the case. Normally, E(B-V) is the difference (B-V observed minus B-V intrinsic), so you can compute A_v as 3.1 * E(B-V). Then the observed apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction) plus A_v.

So, if the problem gives Star3's apparent magnitude as 15.5, but that's the observed (so including extinction), then how would you calculate the intrinsic apparent magnitude?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Star3's given apparent magnitude is the observed value, which already includes the extinction. So, if E(B-V) is 0.6, then A_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86.

So the actual intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v. Because extinction makes it appear fainter (higher m), so if you subtract A_v, you get the m without extinction.

Wait, but that's not the usual approach. Let me think.

Wait, the formula is: m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So, the observed magnitude is larger (fainter) than the intrinsic.

So, if the star's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86, then the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

But wait, Star3 is located at 15 pc. So if we ignore extinction (assuming zero extinction), the apparent magnitude would be m0 = M + 5 log (d/10). M is the absolute magnitude. Wait, but Star3's absolute magnitude isn't given. Wait, wait, the problem doesn't give M for Star3. Wait, let me check.

Looking back: Star3's description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Ah, so Star3's absolute magnitude (M) isn't directly given. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me check all the stars again.

Looking:

Star1: M is 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Star4: M=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

Star5: M=16.5, distance 5 pc.

So, wait, for Star3, do we have enough information to compute its absolute magnitude?

Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about apparent V magnitudes.

Wait, maybe I should compute the apparent magnitude for each star, considering both their absolute magnitudes and distances, plus any extinction.

Wait, for a star, the apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = M + 5 log (d/10), and then with extinction, m = m0 + A_v.

So for each star, I need to compute m, the apparent magnitude, including extinction if applicable.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. Since distance is 10 pc, m0 = M =15.5. No extinction mentioned, so A_v = 0. So m=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5 (given), d=5 pc. So given m is 16.5, but that's the observed one? Or intrinsic?

Wait, Star2's description says "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So m is 16.5, so no need to compute. So m=16.5.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_v=3.1*0.6=1.86. But wait, if m_observed is 15.5, which includes extinction, then the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = m_observed - A_v = 15.5 - 1.86=13.64.

But since the star is at 15 pc, m0 (without extinction) is M + 5 log(15/10) = M + 0.88. So M = m0 -0.88= 13.64 -0.88=12.76.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give M for Star3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction, so when using the instrument's magnitude limit, we have to consider that m is 15.5, which is the observed (fainter) magnitude. Wait, no, because m is the observed magnitude, including extinction. So for detecting, the instrument's limit is based on the observed magnitude.

Wait, the instrument's capability is based on the observed apparent magnitude. So for Star3, if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is below ESPRESSO's limit of 17, and for HIRES, it's 16. So 15.5 is within both, so Star3 would be detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. The problem says for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So does that mean that the 15.5 is the observed (including extinction) magnitude?

Yes, I think so. Because the question gives the apparent V magnitude as 15.5, and then provides E(B-V), which is used to calculate A_v. So the 15.5 is already the observed, extinction-affected magnitude.

In that case, Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO and HIRES limits (since 15.5 <=16 and <=17). So Star3 is detectable by both.

Star4: M=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance=10 pc.

So compute m_observed.

First, compute m0: M + 5 log (10/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5.

Then, A_v=3.1 * 0.4=1.24.

So m_observed = m0 + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, that would make the apparent magnitude 16.74. But Star4's apparent magnitude would be 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit of 16. So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is within. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So Star4 is not a candidate for both.

Star5: M=16.5, distance=5 pc. Compute m0 = M + 5 log (5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, about 15.0.

No extinction mentioned, so m_observed=15.0.

So m=15.0, which is within both instruments' limits (<=16 and <=17). So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait: Star5's M is 16.5, and distance is 5 pc.

So m0 = M + 5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is approximately 15.0.

So apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is within HIRES's 16 limit and ESPRESSO's 17. So yes, detectable by both.

Wait, but wait: reviewing the options, the choices are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, let's go back.

Star1: m=15.5, detectable by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: m=16.5, which is above HIRES's limit of 16, so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star3: m=15.5, detectable by both.

Star4: m=16.74, above HIRES's limit.

Star5: m=15.0, detectable by both.

So which stars can be detected by both instruments?

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are combinations. Let's see:

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, can't be detected by HIRES. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have m ≤16, so detectable by both. So B is a possible correct option.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1's m=15.5, which is within both. Star4's m=16.74, which is not within HIRES's limit. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star5 is detectable by both, but option B includes Star5.

Wait, which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star3: m=15.5 → both.

Star5: m=15.0 → both.

So now, looking at the options:

Option B says Star3 and Star5 are detectable by both.

Option D says Star1 and Star4: Star4 not.

Option A: Star4 and Star5: Star4 no.

So the correct options would be any that include Star1, Star3, or Star5.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So which of the stars are detectable by both.

Let me list each star:

Star1: detectable by both.

Star2: only ESPRESSO.

Star3: detectable by both.

Star4: only ESPRESSO.

Star5: detectable by both.

So the stars that are detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Now, looking at options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → no, because Star4 is not.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is above HIRES's limit, so no.

So the correct answer would be that Star3 and Star5 are detectable by both.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m0 = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)= 16.5 -1.505=14.995, about 15.0.

So m=15.0, which is under both 16 and 17, so yes.

So the stars that meet the condition are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Now, looking at the options, which options include any two of these?

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 is not.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → no.

Another option would be if any of the stars have m>17, but I don't think so.

But wait, let me check Star3 again: m=15.5, which is within both.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So the correct answer would be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = M = 15.5 \) (since \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 is not detectable by HIRES, only ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Total extinction \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude after correcting for extinction:  
     \[
     m = m_{\text{observed}} - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64
     \]  
   - Since \( m = 13.64 \leq 16 \), Star3 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m_0 = M + 5 \log(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Total extinction \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude after correcting for extinction:  
     \[
     m = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 is not detectable by HIRES, only ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m_0 = M + 5 \log(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - No extinction mentioned, so \( m = 15.0 \).  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
Stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Option B (Star3 and Star5)** is correct.

**Answer: B**
