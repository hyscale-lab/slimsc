Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about an enamine reaction. Enamine reactions are a bit tricky, but I remember they involve amines and carbonyl compounds. Enamines are typically formed by the condensation of a secondary amine with a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. This forms a conjugated amine, which is the enamine, and then they can undergo various reactions, like nucleophilic substitutions or additions.

The reaction given is: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium plus reagent A gives product B. The options are about what B is and the correct sequence of reagents A.

Let me break down the starting material first. The compound is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, it's an ethanaminium ion. Ethanamine is CH3CH2NH3+, but here it's substituted. The substituents are N-methyl and N-pentan-2-ylidene.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent. Pentan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but wait, that's not right. The ylidene group is like a substituent attached to the nitrogen. So pentan-2-ylidene would be a group where the double bond is between C2 and C3, I think. Wait, structure-wise, it's (CH2)2CHCH2- but with a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond in a certain position. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond in the 2 position.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the substituent being a pentenyl group. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. No, wait, the ylidene group is attached to the nitrogen. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- connected to the N.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately (CH2)3CH2- attached via a double bond. No, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but attached to the nitrogen. Wait, but the starting material is (E)-configured. So, the substituent on the N is a pentenyl group in the E configuration.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine. So enamine structure is R2C=NR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. So here, the R is from the pentan-2-ylidene and the R' is methyl, perhaps.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH3+CH3 (but that's more like N-methyl ethylammonium). But wait, the structure is N-methyl and N-pentan-2-ylidene, so the nitrogen has two substituents: a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group, and the positive charge is on the adjacent carbon? Or is this a betaine structure?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction steps. The product B is formed when this compound reacts with reagent A, which is a sequence of steps.

Looking at the options, option A says the reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. The product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Option C says product B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, so what's happening here? Enamine reactions are involved in forming ketones. The enamine can act as a nucleophile and perform a Michael addition, or perhaps it's a case of reductive amination. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the enamine is being hydrolyzed.

Wait, but the given starting material is an enamine. Enamines are typically used in the formation of substituted ketones via alkylation. The general process is that the enamine is treated with an alkyl halide, which adds the alkyl group to the enamine, then hydrolysis gives the ketone.

So the steps would be: (1) treatment with a base like LDA to deprotonate and form the enamine (if necessary), then (2) alkylation with an alkyl halide, and (3) acid work-up to hydrolyze back to the ketone.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already the enamine. So perhaps the next step is just the alkylation and then hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a case of using LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) as a strong base. LDA is used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates or to deprotonate amines to form amide anions.

Wait, looking at the options, option A's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So, LDA is a strong base. The DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent.

So, first step with LDA and DME. LDA would deprotonate the enamine. Then CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) would be an alkylating agent. Then H3O+ work-up.

Wait, but what's the structure after each step?

Let me think. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, structure-wise, it's probably something like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- connected to N(CH3) and the adjacent carbon is part of the ethanaminium group, which is positively charged.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanamine with a positive charge on the adjacent carbon. So, perhaps it's a quaternary ammonium structure? Or maybe it's an iminium ion. Hmm, not entirely clear, but perhaps that's not too important for the reaction.

When you treat an enamine with LDA, a strong base, you deprotonate the alpha position. Wait, but enamines are already deprotonated? Or perhaps the LDA is used to deprotonate somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is not in the enamine form yet. Wait, no, the starting material is the enamine.

Wait, perhaps the first step with LDA is to deprotonate the alpha carbon (the carbon adjacent to the N in the enamine) to form an enolate, which can then react with an alkyl halide.

Wait, but enamine enolates are more reactive than regular enolates because the lone pair from the amine is conjugated with the carbonyl, making the alpha protons more acidic.

So, step 1: LDA deprotonates the enamine to form an enolate. Step 2: the enolate attacks ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) as an alkylating agent. Then, step 3: acid work-up with H3O+ to protonate and hydrolyze the enamine back to the ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine, so after alkylation, upon hydrolysis, you would get a larger ketone.

Let me think about the structures. The starting enamine has a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2. So, the enamine would look like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NR2, where R is methyl and the adjacent carbon is part of the ethanaminium.

Wait, perhaps it's structured as (CH2)3CH2- attached via a double bond to the N. So the enamine is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)(CH2CH2...? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is (E)-configured, meaning that the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides.

But maybe the exact structure isn't necessary for the reaction. Let's think about the reagents.

Option A's reagents are (i) LDA/DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+. So, after deprotonation with LDA, the enamine would form an enolate. Then, EtI would alkylate this enolate. Then, upon acid quench, it would hydrolyze back to a ketone.

Wait, but how does the alkylation affect the structure? Let's model it.

Suppose the enamine is R2C=CH-NR'2. So when the alpha proton is abstracted by LDA, the enolate would be R2C(-O-)CH-NR'2.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the enolate would have negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the N. Then, the ethyl iodide would alkylate that carbon, adding an ethyl group.

After alkylation, the structure would have an ethyl group added to the alpha carbon. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would convert back to a ketone, but with the added ethyl group.

Wait, but the starting enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a ketone. When you form an enamine, the general formula is R2C=CR'–NR''2, where the R groups are from the amine and the R' groups are from the carbonyl.

So, when you alkylate the alpha position, you're adding a group to the carbon adjacent to the amine. Then, upon hydrolysis, this becomes part of the ketone.

Wait, let me model this with a simple example. Suppose the enamine is CH2=CHCH2-NR2. When you deprotonate and alkylate with ethyl iodide, you add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon (the CH2 adjacent to N). So, the structure becomes CH2=CH-CHEt-NR2.

Upon hydrolysis (acid work-up), the enamine would break down, and the ketone would form. So the ketone would be (CH2)2-C-OH, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, when the enamine R2C=CR'-NH-R'' reacts with an alkyl halide, the alkyl group adds to the carbon adjacent to the N. Then, when you hydrolyse, the R and R' groups become adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, if the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, after alkylation, you have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. Then, upon hydrolysis, it forms a ketone with the chain extended.

Wait, let's think about the initial structure. The starting enamine comes from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. Suppose the carbonyl was pentan-2-one. Then, the enamine would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-NR2. After alkylation, adding an ethyl group, and then hydrolysis would give a longer ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon amine and a three-carbon ketone, or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, pentan-2-ylidene is (CH2)3CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Or maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with the double bond elsewhere.

I think perhaps trying to track the product's structure would be better.

Option C says the product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-(CH2)2CH3. So it's a seven-carbon chain with the ketone on carbon 4.

How would that form?

If the starting enamine is a five-carbon chain, adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. Let me think. For example, the starting enamine is from a five-carbon amine and a three-carbon ketone. Wait, no, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So perhaps the pentan-2-ylidene is a five-carbon group, and the ethanaminium is two carbons.

So, when you add an ethyl group via alkylation, the chain would become longer.

Wait, perhaps when you hydrolyze, the carbon from the enamine and the added ethyl group form the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting enamine is (E)-configured and has four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Let me think about the reagents. LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates.

So, step 1: LDA would deprotonate the enamine at the alpha position, forming an enolate.

Step 2: The enolate would attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

Step 3: Acid work-up (H3O+) would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine, breaking it down into a ketone.

So, the ketone's structure would depend on where the ethyl group was added.

Now, the starting enamine's structure is (E)-configured, so the addition of ethyl iodide would occur in a specific position.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the enamine's structure would be:

The nitrogen is connected to a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group. The adjacent carbon is part of the ethanaminium, which is positively charged. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH2-CH2+?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated enamine, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH2+.

Wait, maybe the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)(CH2+).

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let's try a different approach.

Looking at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, it's more accurately:

(CH2)3-C(=O)-(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, but the number of carbons: pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons. After adding an ethyl group, perhaps the total becomes seven.

So, if the starting enamine has five carbons (pentan-2-ylidene), and we add an ethyl group (two more carbons), perhaps the product is a seven-carbon ketone.

Wait, but let's think about how the enamine reacts. The enamine is R2C=CR'–NR''2. When you alkylate the alpha carbon (R2C-), you add an alkyl group. Upon hydrolysis, the R and R' become adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, if the starting enamine has a five-carbon chain, adding an ethyl would make seven carbons, but in the ketone, the position would be at the fourth carbon, making heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, but perhaps the ethanaminium is two carbons. Adding an ethyl group would make seven carbons in the product.

So the product would be a seven-carbon ketone, specifically heptan-4-one.

Looking at the options, option C's product B is heptan-4-one. Let's see what the reagents are.

Option C: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

So, the steps would be: deprotonate with LDA, alkylate with EtI, then acid work-up to get the ketone.

Wait, but what about the other options? Option D says reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, the sequence in option C is LDA, DME, then EtI, then H3O+. But option D's step (ii) includes DME along with EtI and H3O+. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps LDA is used in DME as the solvent. So step (i) is LDA in DME, then step (ii) adds EtI and then H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

Which would correspond to option A or C.

Option A's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. That doesn't align with the heptan-4-one idea.

Option C's product is heptan-4-one, which seems to match the longer chain.

But then, looking back, after alkylation, when you hydrolyze, how does the chain length change.

Let me think about the starting material: pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, so the enamine would have that. Adding an ethyl group would make the chain seven carbons, so the ketone would be heptan-4-one.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Looking at the options, option C and D have product B as heptan-4-one.

Now, the reagents: option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So, three steps.

Option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Hmm, perhaps in step (ii) of D, all the other reagents are added together.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base, used in a solvent like THF or DME. So, first, LDA is added in DME (step i of C, or step i of D?), then the alkylating agent is added (EtI), then acid work-up.

Wait, the correct reagent sequence is LDA, then EtI, then H3O+. But the options' wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent A consists of three steps: (i) LDA and DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

Which would match option C's reagents.

Looking back, option C says A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

So, the product is heptan-4-one.

But wait, another possibility: if the starting enamine is derived from a three-carbon ketone, like propanone, and a four-carbon amine, then adding an ethyl group would change the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, when you add ethyl iodide, you're adding two carbons. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would have four carbons, but wait, no, because the starting enamine is longer.

Alternatively, the starting material is an enamine from a secondary amine and a ketone. For example, the ketone is pentan-2-one, and the amine is N-methylpentylamine or something similar. Then, the enamine would have a certain structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-configured, and when you alkylate it, you add an ethyl group. Hydrolysis would then form a longer ketone.

So, if the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, then adding ethyl iodide would give a six-carbon ketone. But option C says heptan-4-one, which is seven carbons.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the product is pentan-2-one with some other amine, but that's what option A says.

Wait, the product in option C is heptan-4-one, which is a seven-carbon ketone. So, let's think about the steps.

If the starting enamine has five carbons (pentan-2-ylidene), and you add an ethyl group (two carbons), the new structure would have seven carbons, but positioned where?

Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be in such a way that the chain is seven carbons, and the ketone is at position four.

So, the product is heptan-4-one.

Therefore, option C and D have that product. Now, checking the reagent sequences.

Option C's reagents: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagents: (i) LDA; (ii) DME, EtI, H3O+.

Which sequence is correct?

In practice, when using LDA, you usually have it in a solvent like THF or DME. So, the first step would be adding LDA in DME. Then, after some time, you add the alkylating agent, like EtI. Then, you work up with acid.

So, the steps would be LDA in DME (step i), then EtI (step ii), then H3O+ (step iii), which matches option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is done in the same step as the solvent. But I think in option C, the steps are more clearly separated.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME (so, LDA is added along with DME as the solvent?), then (ii) EtI, then (iii) H3O+.

Option D: (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, EtI, H3O+.

Hmm, perhaps D's (ii) is adding DME, which would be strange if LDA was already added in step (i). Because LDA is usually added to a solvent.

Option C's (i) is LDA and DME together, which makes sense. So, step (i) is adding LDA in DME. Step (ii) is adding EtI. Step (iii) is adding H3O+.

So, the correct sequence would be option C.

Thus, the product B is heptan-4-one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which undergoes a sequence of steps to form a product B. The reagents and their sequence are critical to determining the final product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Starting Material**: The enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. Its structure includes a pentan-2-ylidene group (a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2) and a methyl group attached to the nitrogen.

2. **Reaction Steps**:
   - **Step (i)**: LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) is used to deprotonate the enamine at the alpha position, forming an enolate.
   - **Step (ii)**: The enolate reacts with ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I), an alkylating agent, to add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.
   - **Step (iii)**: Acid work-up (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the enamine, converting it into a ketone.

3. **Product Formation**:
   - The starting enamine has a five-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene). After alkylation with ethyl iodide, an additional two carbons are added to the chain.
   - Upon hydrolysis, the product is a seven-carbon ketone, specifically heptan-4-one, where the ketone group is at position 4.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Suggests the product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not align with the reaction mechanism or the starting material.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect because it also suggests the product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one, which matches the expected outcome.
   - **Option D**: While the product is correct (heptan-4-one), the reagent sequence is unclear and less likely to represent the standard procedure.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one. This corresponds to **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about an enamine reaction. Enamine reactions are a bit tricky, but I remember they involve amines and carbonyl compounds. Enamines are typically formed by the condensation of a secondary amine with a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. This forms a conjugated amine, which is the enamine, and then they can undergo various reactions, like nucleophilic substitutions or additions.

The reaction given is: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium plus reagent A gives product B. The options are about what B is and the correct sequence of reagents A.

Let me break down the starting material first. The compound is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, it's an ethanaminium ion. Ethanamine is CH3CH2NH3+, but here it's substituted. The substituents are N-methyl and N-pentan-2-ylidene.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent. Pentan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but wait, that's not right. The ylidene group is like a substituent attached to the nitrogen. So pentan-2-ylidene would be a group where the double bond is between C2 and C3, I think. Wait, structure-wise, it's (CH2)2CHCH2- but with a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond in a certain position. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond in the 2 position.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the substituent being a pentenyl group. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. No, wait, the ylidene group is attached to the nitrogen. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- connected to the N.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately (CH2)3CH2- attached via a double bond. No, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but attached to the nitrogen. Wait, but the starting material is (E)-configured. So, the substituent on the N is a pentenyl group in the E configuration.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine. So enamine structure is R2C=NR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. So here, the R is from the pentan-2-ylidene and the R' is methyl, perhaps.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH3+CH3 (but that's more like N-methyl ethylammonium). But wait, the structure is N-methyl and N-pentan-2-ylidene, so the nitrogen has two substituents: a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group, and the positive charge is on the adjacent carbon? Or is this a betaine structure?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction steps. The product B is formed when this compound reacts with reagent A, which is a sequence of steps.

Looking at the options, option A says the reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. The product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Option C says product B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, so what's happening here? Enamine reactions are involved in forming ketones. The enamine can act as a nucleophile and perform a Michael addition, or perhaps it's a case of reductive amination. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the enamine is being hydrolyzed.

Wait, but the given starting material is an enamine. Enamines are typically used in the formation of substituted ketones via alkylation. The general process is that the enamine is treated with an alkyl halide, which adds the alkyl group to the enamine, then hydrolysis gives the ketone.

So the steps would be: (1) treatment with a base like LDA to deprotonate and form the enamine (if necessary), then (2) alkylation with an alkyl halide, and (3) acid work-up to hydrolyze back to the ketone.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already the enamine. So perhaps the next step is just the alkylation and then hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a case of using LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) as a strong base. LDA is used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates or to deprotonate amines to form amide anions.

Wait, looking at the options, option A's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So, LDA is a strong base. The DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent.

So, first step with LDA and DME. LDA would deprotonate the enamine. Then CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) would be an alkylating agent. Then H3O+ work-up.

Wait, but what's the structure after each step?

Let me think. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, structure-wise, it's probably something like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- connected to N(CH3) and the adjacent carbon is part of the ethanaminium group, which is positively charged.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanamine with a positive charge on the adjacent carbon. So, perhaps it's a quaternary ammonium structure? Or maybe it's an iminium ion. Hmm, not entirely clear, but perhaps that's not too important for the reaction.

When you treat an enamine with LDA, a strong base, you deprotonate the alpha position. Wait, but enamines are already deprotonated? Or perhaps the LDA is used to deprotonate somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is not in the enamine form yet. Wait, no, the starting material is the enamine.

Wait, perhaps the first step with LDA is to deprotonate the alpha carbon (the carbon adjacent to the N in the enamine) to form an enolate, which can then react with an alkyl halide.

Wait, but enamine enolates are more reactive than regular enolates because the lone pair from the amine is conjugated with the carbonyl, making the alpha protons more acidic.

So, step 1: LDA deprotonates the enamine to form an enolate. Step 2: the enolate attacks ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) as an alkylating agent. Then, step 3: acid work-up with H3O+ to protonate and hydrolyze the enamine back to the ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine, so after alkylation, upon hydrolysis, you would get a larger ketone.

Let me think about the structures. The starting enamine has a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2. So, the enamine would look like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NR2, where R is methyl and the adjacent carbon is part of the ethanaminium.

Wait, perhaps it's structured as (CH2)3CH2- attached via a double bond to the N. So the enamine is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)(CH2CH2...? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is (E)-configured, meaning that the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides.

But maybe the exact structure isn't necessary for the reaction. Let's think about the reagents.

Option A's reagents are (i) LDA/DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+. So, after deprotonation with LDA, the enamine would form an enolate. Then, EtI would alkylate this enolate. Then, upon acid quench, it would hydrolyze back to a ketone.

Wait, but how does the alkylation affect the structure? Let's model it.

Suppose the enamine is R2C=CH-NR'2. So when the alpha proton is abstracted by LDA, the enolate would be R2C(-O-)CH-NR'2.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the enolate would have negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the N. Then, the ethyl iodide would alkylate that carbon, adding an ethyl group.

After alkylation, the structure would have an ethyl group added to the alpha carbon. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would convert back to a ketone, but with the added ethyl group.

Wait, but the starting enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a ketone. When you form an enamine, the general formula is R2C=CR'–NR''2, where the R groups are from the amine and the R' groups are from the carbonyl.

So, when you alkylate the alpha position, you're adding a group to the carbon adjacent to the amine. Then, upon hydrolysis, this becomes part of the ketone.

Wait, let me model this with a simple example. Suppose the enamine is CH2=CHCH2-NR2. When you deprotonate and alkylate with ethyl iodide, you add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon (the CH2 adjacent to N). So, the structure becomes CH2=CH-CHEt-NR2.

Upon hydrolysis (acid work-up), the enamine would break down, and the ketone would form. So the ketone would be (CH2)2-C-OH, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, when the enamine R2C=CR'-NH-R'' reacts with an alkyl halide, the alkyl group adds to the carbon adjacent to the N. Then, when you hydrolyse, the R and R' groups become adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, if the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, after alkylation, you have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. Then, upon hydrolysis, it forms a ketone with the chain extended.

Wait, let's think about the initial structure. The starting enamine comes from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. Suppose the carbonyl was pentan-2-one. Then, the enamine would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-NR2. After alkylation, adding an ethyl group, and then hydrolysis would give a longer ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon amine and a three-carbon ketone, or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, pentan-2-ylidene is (CH2)3CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Or maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with the double bond elsewhere.

I think perhaps trying to track the product's structure would be better.

Option C says the product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-(CH2)2CH3. So it's a seven-carbon chain with the ketone on carbon 4.

How would that form?

If the starting enamine is a five-carbon chain, adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. Let me think. For example, the starting enamine is from a five-carbon amine and a three-carbon ketone. Wait, no, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So perhaps the pentan-2-ylidene is a five-carbon group, and the ethanaminium is two carbons.

So, when you add an ethyl group via alkylation, the chain would become longer.

Wait, perhaps when you hydrolyze, the carbon from the enamine and the added ethyl group form the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting enamine is (E)-configured and has four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Let me think about the reagents. LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates.

So, step 1: LDA would deprotonate the enamine at the alpha position, forming an enolate.

Step 2: The enolate would attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

Step 3: Acid work-up (H3O+) would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine, breaking it down into a ketone.

So, the ketone's structure would depend on where the ethyl group was added.

Now, the starting enamine's structure is (E)-configured, so the addition of ethyl iodide would occur in a specific position.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the enamine's structure would be:

The nitrogen is connected to a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group. The adjacent carbon is part of the ethanaminium, which is positively charged. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH2-CH2+?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated enamine, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH2+.

Wait, maybe the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)(CH2+).

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let's try a different approach.

Looking at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, it's more accurately:

(CH2)3-C(=O)-(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, but the number of carbons: pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons. After adding an ethyl group, perhaps the total becomes seven.

So, if the starting enamine has five carbons (pentan-2-ylidene), and we add an ethyl group (two more carbons), perhaps the product is a seven-carbon ketone.

Wait, but let's think about how the enamine reacts. The enamine is R2C=CR'–NR''2. When you alkylate the alpha carbon (R2C-), you add an alkyl group. Upon hydrolysis, the R and R' become adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, if the starting enamine has a five-carbon chain, adding an ethyl would make seven carbons, but in the ketone, the position would be at the fourth carbon, making heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, but perhaps the ethanaminium is two carbons. Adding an ethyl group would make seven carbons in the product.

So the product would be a seven-carbon ketone, specifically heptan-4-one.

Looking at the options, option C's product B is heptan-4-one. Let's see what the reagents are.

Option C: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

So, the steps would be: deprotonate with LDA, alkylate with EtI, then acid work-up to get the ketone.

Wait, but what about the other options? Option D says reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, the sequence in option C is LDA, DME, then EtI, then H3O+. But option D's step (ii) includes DME along with EtI and H3O+. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps LDA is used in DME as the solvent. So step (i) is LDA in DME, then step (ii) adds EtI and then H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

Which would correspond to option A or C.

Option A's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. That doesn't align with the heptan-4-one idea.

Option C's product is heptan-4-one, which seems to match the longer chain.

But then, looking back, after alkylation, when you hydrolyze, how does the chain length change.

Let me think about the starting material: pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, so the enamine would have that. Adding an ethyl group would make the chain seven carbons, so the ketone would be heptan-4-one.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Looking at the options, option C and D have product B as heptan-4-one.

Now, the reagents: option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So, three steps.

Option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Hmm, perhaps in step (ii) of D, all the other reagents are added together.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base, used in a solvent like THF or DME. So, first, LDA is added in DME (step i of C, or step i of D?), then the alkylating agent is added (EtI), then acid work-up.

Wait, the correct reagent sequence is LDA, then EtI, then H3O+. But the options' wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent A consists of three steps: (i) LDA and DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

Which would match option C's reagents.

Looking back, option C says A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

So, the product is heptan-4-one.

But wait, another possibility: if the starting enamine is derived from a three-carbon ketone, like propanone, and a four-carbon amine, then adding an ethyl group would change the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, when you add ethyl iodide, you're adding two carbons. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would have four carbons, but wait, no, because the starting enamine is longer.

Alternatively, the starting material is an enamine from a secondary amine and a ketone. For example, the ketone is pentan-2-one, and the amine is N-methylpentylamine or something similar. Then, the enamine would have a certain structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-configured, and when you alkylate it, you add an ethyl group. Hydrolysis would then form a longer ketone.

So, if the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, then adding ethyl iodide would give a six-carbon ketone. But option C says heptan-4-one, which is seven carbons.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the product is pentan-2-one with some other amine, but that's what option A says.

Wait, the product in option C is heptan-4-one, which is a seven-carbon ketone. So, let's think about the steps.

If the starting enamine has five carbons (pentan-2-ylidene), and you add an ethyl group (two carbons), the new structure would have seven carbons, but positioned where?

Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be in such a way that the chain is seven carbons, and the ketone is at position four.

So, the product is heptan-4-one.

Therefore, option C and D have that product. Now, checking the reagent sequences.

Option C's reagents: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) EtI; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagents: (i) LDA; (ii) DME, EtI, H3O+.

Which sequence is correct?

In practice, when using LDA, you usually have it in a solvent like THF or DME. So, the first step would be adding LDA in DME. Then, after some time, you add the alkylating agent, like EtI. Then, you work up with acid.

So, the steps would be LDA in DME (step i), then EtI (step ii), then H3O+ (step iii), which matches option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is done in the same step as the solvent. But I think in option C, the steps are more clearly separated.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME (so, LDA is added along with DME as the solvent?), then (ii) EtI, then (iii) H3O+.

Option D: (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, EtI, H3O+.

Hmm, perhaps D's (ii) is adding DME, which would be strange if LDA was already added in step (i). Because LDA is usually added to a solvent.

Option C's (i) is LDA and DME together, which makes sense. So, step (i) is adding LDA in DME. Step (ii) is adding EtI. Step (iii) is adding H3O+.

So, the correct sequence would be option C.

Thus, the product B is heptan-4-one.


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which undergoes a sequence of steps to form a product B. The reagents and their sequence are critical to determining the final product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Starting Material**: The enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. Its structure includes a pentan-2-ylidene group (a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2) and a methyl group attached to the nitrogen.

2. **Reaction Steps**:
   - **Step (i)**: LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) is used to deprotonate the enamine at the alpha position, forming an enolate.
   - **Step (ii)**: The enolate reacts with ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I), an alkylating agent, to add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.
   - **Step (iii)**: Acid work-up (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the enamine, converting it into a ketone.

3. **Product Formation**:
   - The starting enamine has a five-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene). After alkylation with ethyl iodide, an additional two carbons are added to the chain.
   - Upon hydrolysis, the product is a seven-carbon ketone, specifically heptan-4-one, where the ketone group is at position 4.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Suggests the product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not align with the reaction mechanism or the starting material.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect because it also suggests the product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one, which matches the expected outcome.
   - **Option D**: While the product is correct (heptan-4-one), the reagent sequence is unclear and less likely to represent the standard procedure.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one. This corresponds to **Option C**.
