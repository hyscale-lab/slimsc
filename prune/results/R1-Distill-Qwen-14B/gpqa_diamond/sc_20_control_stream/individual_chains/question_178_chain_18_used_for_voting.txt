Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and relate to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that. But maybe that's not so important right now.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, the action has no dimensions, so each term in the integral is dimension 4). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each part contributes to the dimension. I think the fields have specific dimensions. Fermion fields ψ are dimension 3/2 each, because in 4 dimensions, the Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2. The F tensor is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, so F^{μν} is the field strength, which is the derivative of the gauge field A, so F has dimension [mass]^2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again: the gauge field A_mu has dimension 1. Because the covariant derivative is something like D_mu = partial_mu + i e A_mu, and partial has dimension 1. So A must have dimension 1. Then F_{mu nu} is partial_mu A_nu - partial_nu A_mu, so F has dimension 2 (since each partial is dimension 1, and A is 1, so each term is 2, so F is [mass]^2). 

What about sigma_{mu nu}? That's (i/2) [gamma_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So the commutator [gamma_mu, gamma_nu] is dimensionless, so sigma has dimension 0 as well.

So putting it together: the term is κ * (ψ̄ sigma psi) * F. Let's compute each part's dimension.

ψ̄ σ ψ: ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. sigma is 0. So ψ̄ sigma psi is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. So that part is dimension 3.

Then F is dimension 2. So multiplying them together: 3 + 2 = 5. But the entire term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, right? Because the integral is over d^4x, so each term inside must be dim 4 to make the action (which is ∫ L d^4x) dimensionless.

Wait, wait. No, the Lagrangian itself is an integrand, so each term in L must have dimension 4. So the term κ * (ψ̄ sigma psi) * F must have dimension 4.

So let me compute the dimension of each component:

- ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, sigma is 0, so sigma doesn't contribute. So ψ̄ sigma ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

- F has dimension 2.

So the product (ψ̄ sigma ψ) * F is 3 + 2 = 5.

So the entire term is κ times that product, which is 5. So the term's dimension is [κ] + 5. Since the term must have dimension 4 (because it's part of the Lagrangian), we have:

[κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at the options, that points to options A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension (or zero?). Wait, wait, I think that for a coupling to have a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable, and if it's zero, it's renormalizable, and if negative, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, let's get this straight. The superficial degree of divergence is determined by the dimension of the coupling. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, then the theory is super-renormalizable. If it's zero, the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative, then the theory is non-renormalizable (like higher-dimensional operators).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (n_fermi * [fermion_dim] + n_boson * [boson_dim] + [coupling_dim]).

Wait, no, more accurately, each term in the interaction is considered. The superficial degree of divergence is computed based on the dimensions of the fields and the coupling. For a term like L = g φ^p ψ^q ..., the superficial degree D is d - (d_p * p + d_ψ * q + ...), where d_p is the dimension of field φ, etc.

But for renormalizability, the superficial degree D must be ≤ 0. For a theory with coupling g, if the dimension of g is [g] = [mass]^d_g, then the term in the Lagrangian g φ^m ψ^n ... must have dimension 4.

Wait, in our case, the interaction term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. So the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the fields involved are ψ, ψ, and F. Let me compute the dimension of each part.

As before, [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3, [F] is 2. So the term is [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5. Since each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] must be -1.

Now, the coupling is κ. The dimension is [κ] = -1. So the question is, is [κ] = -1 allowed for a renormalizable theory?

In general, for a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants should have positive mass dimension (wait, no, perhaps not). Wait, I think the key is that the theory is renormalizable if all the interaction terms have coupling constants with mass dimension ≥ 0. Because then the number of possible divergences is limited, making the theory renormalizable.

Wait, for example, in φ^4 theory, the coupling λ has [λ] = 4 - 4*(d_φ) → where d_φ is dimension of scalar field. In 4d, scalar is dim 1, so [λ] = 4 -4*1=0. So λ is dim 0 → renormalizable.

In Fermi's theory of weak interactions, the coupling is dimension -1 (since Fermi's coupling constant is ∼ G_F ~ 1/(√2 M_W^2 ), so G_F has dimension -2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Fermi's theory is a four-fermion interaction. The Lagrangian term is something like G (ψ̄ ψ)^2. So the term is G ψ̄ ψ ψ̄ ψ. Each ψ is 3/2, so four fermions contribute 3/2 *4=6. So [G] must be 4 - 6 = -2.

Wait, but wait, in the given question, the coupling κ is in a term with three fields: ψ̄, ψ, and F. So the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimension of each part:

ψ̄: 3/2

ψ: 3/2

F: 2.

So the product ψ̄ ψ F is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. Then, the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F ), so the dimension is [κ] +5. For the term to have dimension 4, [κ] = -1.

Now, for the renormalizability: the coupling's dimension is [κ] = -1. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a non-negative mass dimension. Because if the dimension is negative, the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

So a coupling with dimension [g] ≥ 0 means the theory is renormalizable. So here, [κ] is -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think about the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree D is given by D = d - (sum of dimensions of fields) + L_coupling's dimension. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the term in the Lagrangian.

Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - (n_ψ * (3/2) + n_{F} *2) ) + [coupling terms]. Wait, perhaps another way. For each vertex, the coupling contributes a certain dimension. Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the maximum power of momentum that can appear in the integral, which determines the superficial degree.

Wait, the superficial degree D for a Feynman diagram is calculated as:

D = d - (number of bosonic propagators * their dim + number of fermionic propagators * their dim) + number of vertices * [coupling dim]

No, wait. Let me get this straight. Each loop contributes 4 dimensions (since in 4d, each loop integral is ∫d^4k). The superficial degree is determined by the number of possible divergences, so D = 4L - (E_p φ + E_ψ ψ), where E_p is the number of propagators for φ, E_ψ for ψ. But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, in terms of the interaction term, each vertex in the Feynman diagram corresponds to the coupling term. The coupling term's dimension affects the superficial degree.

Wait, in the given case, the interaction term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. So each vertex is a four-point vertex? Wait, no. It's one ψ̄, one ψ, and the F tensor. Hmm, but F is the field strength tensor, which is derived from the gauge field A. So perhaps this term is a vertex connecting two fermions (because ψ̄ and ψ) and two photon lines (since F is from A). So it's a four-point vertex: two fermion lines and two photon lines. So each vertex would have four legs: 2 fermion lines (in and out) and 2 photon lines.

Wait, but the exact structure may not matter for the superficial degree. What matters is the dimension of the coupling and the fields involved.

In any case, the dimension of κ is -1. So when you go to higher loops, the coupling becomes more important at higher energies. Negative dimension couplings imply that the theory has higher-dimensional operators, which are non-renormalizable.

Wait, another approach: the general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Because that ensures that the interaction terms are "local" and don't require introducing an infinite number of counterterms.

In this case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option would have [κ]=-1 and the theory not being renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions to ensure the action is dimensionless. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore have mass dimension 4.

- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $3/2$, so $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $3$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless since it is constructed from the dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices.

Thus, the product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $3 + 2 = 5$. For the entire term to have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:

\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms do not introduce higher-dimensional operators, which would make the theory non-renormalizable. Here, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
