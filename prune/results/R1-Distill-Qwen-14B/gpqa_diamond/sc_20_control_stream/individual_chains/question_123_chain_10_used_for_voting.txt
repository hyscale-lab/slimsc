Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, okay, let's think through this carefully.

The question says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, right? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is coming towards them at 60,000 km/s. So that makes sense.

Now, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, wait, that's a time in different reference frames. So we're dealing with time dilation here because of special relativity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. How do I relate the time in one frame to the other? Oh right, time dilation occurs when there's relative motion between frames. Since the ejecta and galaxy are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light, their time measurements will differ.

So, the time experienced in the galaxy's frame (let's call it T) and the ejecta's frame (t) are related by the Lorentz transformation. The formula for time dilation is T = gamma * t, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

Wait, but wait. We have to figure out which frame's time is which. The problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (t = 50 s). So we need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame to find the distance. Because the distance the ejecta travels is speed multiplied by time in the galaxy's frame.

So, let's compute gamma first. The speed v is 60,000 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v is 0.2c, since 60,000 is 20% of 300,000.

Calculating gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let's compute that. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98. So 1 / 0.98 is roughly 1.0204. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.96 is 24/25, so sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, 0.96 is 0.96. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let's see: 0.98 squared is (0.98)^2 = 0.9604. Oh wait, that's exactly 0.9604. So sqrt(0.9604) is 0.98, which is exactly the square of 0.98. So sqrt(0.96) is slightly less than 0.98. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let me think, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is 0.0004 above 0.96. So subtract a little. Let's say sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798 approximately. So gamma is about 1.020204.

So, gamma is approximately 1.0206. So the time in the galaxy's frame, T, is gamma multiplied by t. So T = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them. But the galaxy is much larger. Hmm, but I don't think that affects the calculation here because the problem is focusing on the time experienced in each frame.

So, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's frame, because the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the galaxy. So, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, more time has passed in the galaxy's frame. So T is about 51.03 seconds.

But wait, actually, I'm a bit confused about the direction. Let me think about the relative motion. The galaxy is moving towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at v. So, the proper time (the time in the galaxy's frame) is longer than the ejecta's time. So yes, T is larger than t.

So, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is v = 60,000 km/s. The time in the galaxy's frame is T = gamma * t.

So distance = speed * time. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta travels distance d = v * T = v * gamma * t.

Wait, that's an alternative way to compute it. Alternatively, since the ejecta's own time is t, and in that time, the galaxy's frame says more time has passed. So for each second in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy has T = gamma * 1 second.

So, the distance the ejecta moves is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So d = v * T = v * gamma * t.

Alternatively, since the ejecta's speed is v in the galaxy's frame, and the time is T, then yes, d = v * T.

So let's compute that. v is 60,000 km/s. Gamma is approximately 1.0206. t is 50 s.

So T = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s.

Wait, no, wait. Gamma is the factor by which t is multiplied to get T. So T = gamma * t. So yes, that's correct.

So d = v * T = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.

Wait, let me compute this. 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

Well, 60,000 *50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Wait, that's about 3,061,800 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough, considering we approximated gamma earlier.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute gamma more accurately. Because earlier approximation might have introduced some error.

Wait, let's compute gamma more precisely. v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2 c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(0.96) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately. Let me calculate it as 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89897948557.

So sqrt(24)/5 = 4.89897948557 / 5 ≈ 0.979795897114.

So gamma is 1 /0.979795897114 ≈ 1.020305.

So gamma is approximately 1.020305.

So T = 50 * 1.020305 ≈ 51.01525 seconds.

So then d = v * T = 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s.

Compute this: 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 * 0.01525 = 915 km. So total is 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation because I approximated gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute gamma more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact expression:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v/c = 0.2.

So v²/c² = 0.04.

Thus, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9798 (as we calculated earlier).

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.020305.

So, T = 50 * 1.020305 ≈ 51.01525 seconds.

So distance d = 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s.

Let me compute 60,000 * 51.01525.

Breaking it down: 51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.01525 * 60,000 = 915 km.

So total is 3,060,915 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, 3,060,000 km. But wait, option D is exactly 3,060,000. Our calculation is 3,060,915, which is 915 km more. Hmm, that's a difference of about 0.03%—not sure if that's due to approximation in gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

We can use the Taylor expansion or a better approximation method.

Let me think: Let x = 0.96.

sqrt(x) can be approximated as sqrt(1 - y), where y = 0.04.

Using the expansion sqrt(1 - y) ≈ 1 - y/2 - y²/8 - y^3/(16) ... 

So y = 0.04.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2 /8 - (0.04)^3/(16) 

Calculating each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: 0.04/2 = 0.02 → subtract 0.02.

Third term: (0.04)^2 = 0.0016; 0.0016 /8 = 0.0002 → subtract 0.0002.

Fourth term: (0.04)^3 = 0.000064 → divided by 16 is 0.000004 → subtract 0.000004.

So:

1 - 0.02 = 0.98.

0.98 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.

0.9798 - 0.000004 = 0.979796.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979796.

So gamma is 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.020305.

So, T = 50 * 1.020305 = 51.01525 seconds.

Thus, d = 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s = 60,000 *51.01525 = ?

Let me compute 60,000 *51.01525:

51.01525 = 51 + 0.01525.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km.

60,000 *0.01525 = 60,000 * 15.25e-3 = (60,000 *15) e-3 + (60,000 *0.25)e-3.

60,000 *15 = 900,000 → 900,000e-3 = 900 km.

60,000 *0.25 = 15,000 → 15,000e-3 =15 km.

So 900 +15 = 915 km.

Total d = 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.

But looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation where gamma is approximated as 1.02, making the distance 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Wait, maybe I mixed up the frames. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. So the speed is the same in both frames.

So the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame, which is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.

But the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation.

So, the time in the galaxy's frame is T = gamma * t.

So, correct, and yes, the distance is v * T.

But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately and see if the answer is exactly one of the options.

Wait, let me compute 50 * gamma with gamma being 1.020305.

50 * 1.020305 = 51.01525 seconds.

So, 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s = 60,000 *51.01525.

Wait, maybe I should compute this product more accurately.

Compute 51.01525 *60,000.

51 *60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.01525 *60,000 = 915 km.

So, 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.

But the options don't have that. The closest is D) 3,060,000, but that's 915 km less than our calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another thought—maybe the distance is measured in the galaxy's frame, but considering length contraction. Wait, wait, no. Length contraction applies to objects in motion relative to the observer. But in this case, the distance is the distance the ejecta travels, which is determined by velocity multiplied by time in the galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider velocity from the perspective of each frame, but I think the approach I took earlier is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma. Let me try another approach. Let me compute gamma again with exact calculation.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.

So, v^2/c^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.020305.

So, 50 * 1.020305 = 51.01525 s.

Distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s = ?

Compute 60,000 *51.01525.

Let me compute 51.01525 *60,000.

51.01525 * 60,000 = ?

51 *60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.01525 *60,000 = 915.

So, 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is D)3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but perhaps the problem expects a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps the time in the ejecta's frame is t=50 s, and the speed is 60,000 km/s, but without considering relativity. That would give 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that can't be right because relativity must be considered here.

Wait, but if the question says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, then we have to account for time dilation. So the galaxy's frame would measure a longer time, hence a longer distance.

So, perhaps the intended answer is D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the exact gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma as 1.020305 exactly.

So, T = 50 * 1.020305 = 51.01525 s.

So, distance is 60,000 *51.01525 = 3,060,915 km.

But that's not an option. So, perhaps the problem expects us to use an approximate value for gamma, like 1.02, leading to 50 *1.02=51 s. So, 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. That's option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The problem involves relativistic effects due to the significant relative velocity between the two frames.

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (\( t = 50 \, \text{s} \)) is related to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( T \)) by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   T = \gamma \cdot t = 1.0203 \cdot 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   d = v \cdot T
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( T \approx 51.015 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   d = 60,000 \cdot 51.015 \approx 3,060,915 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\( \approx 3,060,915 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option \( D \), \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the calculation of \( \gamma \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).
