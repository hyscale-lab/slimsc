Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some numbers looking pretty acidic or basic.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider the neutralization reactions. But wait, there are two acids here and one base. So first, I think I should figure out how much of each acid and base are present in moles, then see if they neutralize each other, and whatever is left will determine the pH.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

First, for CH3COOH (acetic acid). The formula is moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate, but maybe if it's mixed with a base, it'll form acetate ions.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. The moles are 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- from this would be 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they'll react. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is strong, and the base is Ba(OH)2. So the reaction would be between the acids (H+ sources) and the base (OH-). But wait, the base is a strong one, so it will dissociate completely, giving OH-.

Wait, but how does the neutralization work here? The total H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. The one that's in excess will determine the pH.

So let's calculate the total H+ from the acids. Wait, but wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+; CH3COOH is a weak acid, which also contributes H+ but not completely.

But wait, in the presence of a strong base, maybe the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from the strong acid first, since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the neutralization would first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- would neutralize the weak acid's H+.

So first, let's calculate the total H+ from HCl and the total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

When H+ and OH- react, they form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The moles of H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So 0.08 H+ will react with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted.

Wait, so after neutralizing the HCl, there's still OH- left. Now, what about the acetic acid?

CH3COOH is a weak acid. It can donate H+. But the OH- will react with any H+ available. So the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. However, when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- will neutralize a mole of CH3COOH, producing acetate ions.

So, how much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 moles.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. So the OH- will react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH if available. But wait, we only have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So all of the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and some OH- will remain.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The OH- can neutralize the CH3COOH. Since we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-, the CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait:

Wait, the first step was neutralizing the HCl's H+ with the OH- from Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-. Then, the remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So in the second step, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after all reactions, the total solution will have excess OH-.

Wait, so the total solution's volume is the sum of all the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the moles of OH- in excess are 0.05 moles. 

But wait, wait! Let me double-check. Because Ba(OH)2 provides OH- which is 0.18 moles. HCl provides 0.08 moles H+. 

When they react: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

So after that, OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, the remaining OH- is 0.10. Now, this will react with CH3COOH. The CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So each mole of OH- neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, producing acetate and water.

So:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05), so all CH3COOH is consumed, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 moles.

Now, the solution's total volume is 1.2 L. So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, to find pH, since it's basic, we can compute pOH first. pOH = -log [OH-] = -log(0.0416667).

Calculating that: log(0.0416667) is about log(1/24) ≈ log(0.041667) ≈ 1.3802.

Wait, because 10^(-1.38) ≈ 0.0417. So pOH is about 1.38. Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute the OH- concentration more accurately.

0.05 moles OH- in 1.2 L → 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

Calculating pOH:

pOH = -log(0.0416667) → Let me compute log(0.0416667):

log(0.0416667) = log(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log(4.16667) + log(10^-2) = approx 0.6198 - 2 → -1.3802.

So pOH is 1.3802, which is about 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, did I account for all the possibilities? Did I overlook any reactions?

Wait, another thing to consider: when you mix a weak acid and a strong base, the reaction is straightforward, but sometimes people might get confused about whether all the OH- is neutralized by the HCl first, and then any remaining OH- neutralizes the weak acid. So in this case, yes, the HCl (strong acid) is neutralized first, leaving OH- which then reacts with the acetic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from the acetic acid would react with the OH- before the HCl's H+? But no, because HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely, so its H+ is available immediately. So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid.

Wait, another approach: calculate total H+ and total OH- from each solution.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But since HCl is strong, it contributes 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH is weak, so it contributes some H+, but in presence of excess OH-, it'll be neutralized.

Total OH- is from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

But I think the initial approach is correct.

Another way to approach it: calculate the net moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 (since it's a weak acid, but in presence of OH-, it's neutralized, so perhaps it's negligible, but in this case, all of it is neutralized by OH-).

Wait, no, H3COOH is a weak acid, but when OH- is present, it'll react with it. So the net H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH (but only the amount not neutralized by OH-).

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of all species.

Total H+ sources: HCl gives 0.08, CH3COOH gives 0.05 (but only if not neutralized).

Total OH- sources: Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18.

They will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So total H+ available is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13.

Total OH- available is 0.18.

So, when they react, the 0.13 H+ will neutralize 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 OH-.

So moles of OH- remaining: 0.05.

Which is the same as before. So the calculation holds.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 L ≈ 0.041667 M.

pOH = 1.38, so pH = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (CH₃COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - The \( \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂ reacts with the \( \text{H}^+ \) from HCl first.  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \rightarrow 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
     After this reaction, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \) remain.
   - The remaining \( \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH.  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \rightarrow 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \).  
     After this reaction, \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \) remain.

3. **Determine the concentration of excess \( \text{OH}^- \):**
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some numbers looking pretty acidic or basic.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

First, for CH3COOH (acetic acid). The formula is moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate, but maybe if it's mixed with a base, it'll form acetate ions.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. The moles are 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- from this would be 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they'll react. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is strong, and the base is Ba(OH)2. So the reaction would be between the acids (H+ sources) and the base (OH-). But wait, the base is a strong one, so it will dissociate completely, giving OH-.

Wait, but how does the neutralization work here? The total H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. The one that's in excess will determine the pH.

So let's calculate the total H+ from the acids. Wait, but wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+; CH3COOH is a weak acid, which also contributes H+ but not completely.

But wait, in the presence of a strong base, maybe the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from the strong acid first, since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the neutralization would first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- would neutralize the weak acid's H+.

So first, let's calculate the total H+ from HCl and the total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

When H+ and OH- react, they form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The moles of H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So 0.08 H+ will react with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted.

Wait, so after neutralizing the HCl, there's still OH- left. Now, what about the acetic acid?

CH3COOH is a weak acid. It can donate H+. But the OH- will react with any H+ available. So the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. However, when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- will neutralize a mole of CH3COOH, producing acetate ions.

So, how much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 moles.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. So the OH- will react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH if available. But wait, we only have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So all of the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and some OH- will remain.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The OH- can neutralize the CH3COOH. Since we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-, the CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait:

Wait, the first step was neutralizing the HCl's H+ with the OH- from Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-. Then, the remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So in the second step, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after all reactions, the total solution will have excess OH-.

Wait, so the total solution's volume is the sum of all the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the moles of OH- in excess are 0.05 moles. 

But wait, wait! Let me double-check. Because Ba(OH)2 provides OH- which is 0.18 moles. HCl provides 0.08 moles H+. 

When they react: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

So after that, OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, the remaining OH- is 0.10. Now, this will react with CH3COOH. The CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So each mole of OH- neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, producing acetate and water.

So:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05), so all CH3COOH is consumed, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 moles.

Now, the solution's total volume is 1.2 L. So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, to find pH, since it's basic, we can compute pOH first. pOH = -log [OH-] = -log(0.0416667).

Calculating that: log(0.0416667) is about log(1/24) ≈ log(0.041667) ≈ 1.3802.

Wait, because 10^(-1.38) ≈ 0.0417. So pOH is about 1.38. Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute the OH- concentration more accurately.

0.05 moles OH- in 1.2 L → 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

Calculating pOH:

pOH = -log(0.0416667) → Let me compute log(0.0416667):

log(0.0416667) = log(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log(4.16667) + log(10^-2) = approx 0.6198 - 2 → -1.3802.

So pOH is 1.3802, which is about 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, did I account for all the possibilities? Did I overlook any reactions?

Wait, another thing to consider: when you mix a weak acid and a strong base, the reaction is straightforward, but sometimes people might get confused about whether all the OH- is neutralized by the HCl first, and then any remaining OH- neutralizes the weak acid.

Total OH- is from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

But I think the initial approach is correct.

Another way to approach it: calculate the net moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 (since it's a weak acid, but in presence of OH-, it's neutralized, so perhaps it's negligible, but in this case, all of it is neutralized by OH-).

Total OH- sources: Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18.

They will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So total H+ available is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13.

Total OH- available is 0.18.

So, when they react, the 0.13 H+ will neutralize 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 OH-.

So moles of OH- remaining: 0.05.

Which is the same as before. So the calculation holds.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 L ≈ 0.041667 M.

pOH = 1.38, so pH = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (CH₃COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - The \( \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂ reacts with the \( \text{H}^+ \) from HCl first.  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \rightarrow 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
     After this reaction, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \) remain.
   - The remaining \( \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH.  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \rightarrow 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \).  
     After this reaction, \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \) remain.

3. **Determine the concentration of excess \( \text{OH}^- \):**
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A
