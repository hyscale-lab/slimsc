Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. We need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates has a specific formula. Since the field is radial, only the r-component will matter. The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r) + ... other terms, but since the other components (theta and phi) are zero, those terms won't contribute. So divergence here would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

Wait, f(r) has magnitude 1/r² and it's radial, so f_r = f(r) = 1/r². So substituting that in, the divergence becomes (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Let me compute that derivative. Let's see, r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence of f is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin. Oh wait, but wait a second—divergence is zero except where the function is not defined, like at r=0. Because at r=0, f(r) would blow up. So in the region r>0, the divergence is zero.

But wait, the divergence theorem comes into play here. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the volume, then the volume integral should be zero. But wait, the vector field f(r) is 1/r² radial. Isn't that similar to the electric field of a point charge?

Wait, the electric field of a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂. The divergence of this field is zero everywhere except at r=0. So according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over a volume that includes the origin would be equal to the flux through the surface. For a point charge, that would be Gauss's law, where the flux is Q_enc / ε₀, which for a charge q is (q)/(ε₀).

But wait, in our problem, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So the divergence is zero except at r=0. So the volume integral over any region that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the region does include the origin, like our sphere of radius R, then the integral is not zero—it's equal to the flux through the surface.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the divergence again. f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So f_r = 1/r², and the other components are zero.

Divergence ∇·f is (1/r² d/dr (r² f_r)).

Substituting f_r, it's (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ].

r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 is zero. So ∇·f = 0 for r ≠ 0.

So within the sphere of radius R (assuming R>0), the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the volume integral over the entire sphere would be zero, right? Because the divergence is zero in the volume except at a single point which has measure zero.

Wait, but wait again. The divergence theorem says:

∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS

So if the divergence is zero everywhere in the volume except at the origin, the integral becomes the flux through the surface. What is the flux of f through the sphere of radius R?

The vector field is radial, so the flux is f(R) multiplied by the surface area.

f(R) is 1/R², and the surface area is 4π R². So flux is (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of divergence is equal to this flux. But wait, that's only when the divergence is considered over a region that includes the origin. Because when the origin is inside the volume, the divergence isn't zero in the volume—it's zero everywhere except at the point charge origin.

Wait, so the volume integral is equal to the flux, which is 4π. But wait, that can't be right because inside the volume, the divergence is zero except at a point, so the integral would be zero plus a delta function at the origin. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the volume integral of the divergence would be zero, but only if the origin is not included. But in our problem, the sphere is centered at the origin and has radius R. So the origin is inside the sphere. Therefore, the integral is not zero—it's equal to the flux through the surface.

Wait, but if f(r) = 1/(r²) radial, then what is its flux through a sphere of radius R?

At r = R, the field is f(R) = 1/R². The flux is the field at R multiplied by the area, since the field is radial and uniform in direction over the sphere's surface. So flux = (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this flux, which is 4π. But wait, earlier I thought that the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, which would make the integral zero. So am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the divergence of f with the behavior near the origin. Because f(r) itself is undefined at r=0, but the divergence elsewhere is zero. So the volume integral would be zero except for a delta function at the origin. So when the origin is included in the volume, the integral becomes 4π?

Wait, another way to think about it: the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. So in the entire volume except the origin, the divergence is zero, so the integral is zero. But the origin is a point, which has no volume, so perhaps the integral is zero. But that contradicts the divergence theorem approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the divergence being zero in the volume and the flux. Let me go back. The divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but when you integrate the divergence over the volume, you get the flux through the surface. So if the divergence is zero in the entire volume except at the origin, then the integral would be the same as if the divergence were a delta function at the origin.

Wait, yes! Because when a function is zero everywhere except a point, its integral is the value at that point multiplied by the volume it occupies—but points have zero volume. However, for the divergence theorem, which includes the origin, the flux is 4π, so the volume integral must also be 4π.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the volume integral would be zero, but the flux is 4π.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. Oh wait, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral of divergence over the volume is not zero because the divergence is actually a delta function at the origin. So, because the divergence isn't zero in the volume— it's a delta function at the origin— the integral of the divergence isn't zero.

Wait, but when you compute the divergence of f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, you get zero for all r ≠ 0. So the volume integral is zero except possibly at r=0. But the integral of a function that is zero everywhere except a single point is zero because a single point has measure zero in a volume. So the integral should be zero.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the divergence theorem, which says that the flux through the surface is equal to the integral of the divergence. But if the divergence is zero in the volume, the flux should be zero, but we calculated the flux to be 4π.

So where is the mistake?

Oh! Because when the origin is inside the volume, the vector field isn't defined there, and the divergence isn't zero in the entire volume. Wait, perhaps I should think about the behavior of the vector field as it approaches the origin. Let's compute the divergence of f(r):

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

The divergence in spherical coordinates is:

(1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * f_r) + ... other terms for theta and phi. Since f_r is 1/r², and other components are zero, so:

∇·f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0 for r ≠ 0.

But at r=0, the field is singular. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So when integrating over the volume, the divergence is zero except for a point, which doesn't contribute to the integral. So the volume integral of divergence is zero.

But wait, when I use the divergence theorem, the integral of divergence over the volume equals the flux through the surface. But according to this, the volume integral would be zero, but the flux is 4π.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So which one is right?

Ah, perhaps when the origin is inside the volume, the divergence is not zero because the function isn't smooth there. So the divergence theorem applies only when the function is smooth in the region and on its boundary. Here, our vector field is singular at the origin, which is inside the sphere. So perhaps the divergence theorem can't be applied directly because the field isn't differentiable at the origin. Or perhaps the divergence theorem still holds, but the divergence includes a Dirac delta function at the origin.

Wait, that makes sense. For a vector field that behaves like 1/r², the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it has a delta function.

So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), where δ is the Dirac delta function. Because when you integrate this over all space, you get 4π, which matches the flux.

So in this case, the volume integral of ∇·f within the sphere would be 4π, since the origin is included.

Wait, but earlier I thought the divergence is zero except at the origin, so the integral would be zero. But that's not correct because the divergence includes a delta function, which is not zero.

So the integral of ∇·f inside the sphere of radius R is 4π.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement: the vector field has non-zero component only along the radial direction. So the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Its divergence is 4π δ³(r), so the volume integral over the sphere would be 4π times the volume that includes the origin, which it does. So the integral is 4π.

But let me double-check. If the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, then the divergence is ∇·f = 4π δ(r). So integrating over any volume that includes the origin would give 4π, and any volume that doesn't include the origin would give zero.

In our problem, the sphere is centered at the origin with radius R, which is larger than zero. So the origin is definitely inside the sphere. Therefore, the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 4 π

B) 1

C) 4/3 π R

D) 0

So the correct answer would be A) 4π.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the divergence is zero, so the integral would be zero. But I must have made a mistake there. Because the divergence isn't zero—it's a delta function. So I think the correct approach is that the integral equals the flux, which is 4π.

Wait, so the correct answer is A) 4π.

The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin. The vector field is given as **f(r) = (1/r²) r̂**, which is radial and has a magnitude of **1/r²**. The divergence of this field is computed in spherical coordinates, and the divergence theorem is used to relate the volume integral to the flux through the surface of the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:  
   The divergence of **f(r)** is calculated using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0 \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
   \]
   At \( r = 0 \), the field is singular, and the divergence is proportional to a Dirac delta function:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r).
   \]

2. **Volume Integral of the Divergence**:  
   The volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius \( R \) is:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV.
   \]
   Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), the integral reduces to the contribution from the origin. For a volume that includes the origin, this is equal to the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere.

3. **Flux Through the Surface**:  
   The flux of **f(r)** through the surface of the sphere is computed as:
   \[
   \text{Flux} = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS,
   \]
   where \( \mathbf{n} \) is the outward unit normal vector to the surface. Since \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \mathbf{r} \) is radial and uniform over the surface, the flux simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{Flux} = f(R) \cdot 4\pi R^2 = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
   \]

4. **Conclusion Using the Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence equals the flux through the surface. Since the sphere includes the origin, the volume integral of the divergence is:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \text{Flux} = 4\pi.
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 4π**: Correct, as shown by the flux calculation and the divergence theorem.
- **B) 1**: Incorrect, as the integral evaluates to \( 4\pi \), not 1.
- **C) 4/3 π R**: Incorrect, as this does not match the flux or the divergence theorem result.
- **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the divergence is not zero over the volume due to the singularity at the origin.

### Final Answer:
The volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere is **4π**.  
**Answer: A**
