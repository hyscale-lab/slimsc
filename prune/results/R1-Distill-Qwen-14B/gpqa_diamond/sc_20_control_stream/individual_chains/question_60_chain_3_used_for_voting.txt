Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. 

So, the problem says that an astronaut is 22 years old and is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Oh, wait, but the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. 

Wait, time dilation has two effects here. There's the time experienced by the astronaut, which would be less due to their high velocity. Also, there's the distance they need to cover. I think the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Wait, I remember that the LMC is roughly about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. 

So first, I need to find out how long the trip takes from Earth's frame of reference. Because the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, the time it would take in Earth's frame is distance divided by speed. So time_earth = distance / speed. 

Distance is 160,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c, so in units, since speed is in terms of c, the calculation would be 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let me compute that. 

Wait, 160,000 divided by approximately 1. Because 0.99999987 is almost 1. Let me compute it more accurately. 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. So multiplying 160,000 by that gives about 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013). Let me compute 160,000 * 1.3e-7. Hmm, 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 0.00000013 = 0.0208. So approximately 160,000.0208 years? So about 160,000 years as seen from Earth. 

But wait, that's a really long time. But the astronaut is 22 years old and their average lifetime is 150 years. So if it takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would have aged 160,000 years, which is way beyond their lifespan. But wait, that's from Earth's frame. The astronaut's own clock would tick slower. 

Oh, right, because of time dilation. So the proper time experienced by the astronaut is less than the time in Earth's frame. The proper time τ is given by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. 

v is 0.99999987c. So v² is (0.99999987)^2 * c². So v²/c² is approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. 

(1 - 1.23e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.23e-7 + (1.23e-7)^2. Probably, the last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.46e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.46e-7). Let me compute that. 

Wait, 2.46e-7 is 2.46 * 1e-7 = 0.000000246. The square root of that is sqrt(0.000000246). Hmm, sqrt(0.00000025) is 0.0005, because (0.0005)^2 is 0.00000025. So sqrt(0.000000246) is a bit less than 0.0005. 

Wait, 0.0005 is 5e-4. Let me compute 5e-4 squared: 2.5e-7. Wait, but our value is 2.46e-7, which is a bit less than 2.5e-7. So sqrt(2.46e-7) is about 0.000496. Let me think: 0.000496^2 is (4.96e-4)^2 = (4.96)^2 * 1e-8 = about 24.6 * 1e-8 = 2.46e-7. Yes, so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is approximately 0.000496. 

So τ = t * 0.000496. And t is the time from Earth's frame, which is about 160,000 years. So τ = 160,000 * 0.000496 ≈ 79.36 years. 

Wait, so the astronaut would experience about 79.36 years of their own time. But the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old. So they would age about 79 years. Their lifespan is 150 years, so 22 +79 is 101, which is within their lifespan. But wait, the question is, how long will it take from the astronaut's perspective to reach Earth. So the answer is approximately 80 years. 

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years, option D is 77. Hmm. So my calculation is 79.36, which is close to 80. Wait, perhaps I made an approximation. Let me double-check. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact Lorentz factor. Let me compute gamma which is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²). So v is 0.99999987 c. So v/c is 0.99999987. So 1 - (v/c)^2 is 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that more accurately. 

Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 is 1 - 2*(1.23e-7) + (1.23e-7)^2. So that's 1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.51e-14. The last term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.46e-7. 

So 1 - v²/c² is approximately 2.46e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.46e-7) as before, which is 0.000496. 

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute (1 -v²/c²) = (1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 ≈ 0.0000002599999999. 

Wait, 0.99999987 squared is (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.23e-7 + (1.23e-7)^2. Let me compute 2*1.23e-7 = 2.46e-7. The square is (1.23e-7)^2 = ~1.5e-14, negligible. So 1 - 2.46e-7 ≈ 0.9999997534, so 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997534 = 0.0000002466. 

So sqrt(0.0000002466) = sqrt(2.466e-7). Let me compute that. I know that sqrt(2.5e-7) is approximately 0.0005, as before. But 2.466 is a bit less. So 0.000496 as before. 

So again, τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 0.000496 ≈ 79.36 years. So approximately 79.36 years. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 77 years and C) 81 years. Hmm. So 79.36 is closer to 79, but the options don't have 79. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I made an error in the distance. 

Wait, the distance: Is the Large Magellanic Cloud really 160,000 light-years away? Or is it about 160,000? I think it's about 160,000 light-years. Let me confirm. Oh wait, no, I think the actual distance is about 160,000 light-years. So that part is right. 

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the time from the spaceship's perspective using the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. So the proper length is the Earth to LMC distance, which is 160,000 ly. But in the spaceship's frame, the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, no. Proper length is the length in the rest frame, which is Earth's frame. So the length L0 is 160,000 ly. The moving observer (astronaut) would see the distance as L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time experienced by the astronaut is L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v. 

Wait, let me compute that. So L0 is 160,000 ly. So L = 160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ly. Then time τ = L / v = (160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) / v. Since v is 0.99999987 c. 

Wait, let's compute this. So τ = (160,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)) ) / (0.99999987 c) * c / c → the units will cancel, and it's in years because L is in light-years. 

Wait, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is same as before, 0.000496. So τ = (160,000 * 0.000496) / 0.99999987 ≈ (79.36) / 0.99999987 ≈ 79.36 years. 

Same result as before. So the astronaut would experience about 79.36 years. So the options are 77, 72, 81, or 81 is the closest. So maybe 79 rounds to 80, but the options don't have 80. So perhaps the calculation is approximated. 

Wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation of 160,000 * 0.000496. Let me compute 160,000 * 0.000496. 160,000 * 0.0004 is 64. 160,000 * 0.000096 is 15.36. So total is 64 +15.36 =79.36. Right. 

So about 79.36 years. The options given are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77. So the closest is not exactly an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in any step?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Let me compute 1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2. 

0.99999987 is equal to 1 - 1.23e-7. So squaring this: (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2. Where a is 1.23e-7. So 1 - 2*(1.23e-7) + (1.23e-7)^2. So 1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.51e-14. The last term is negligible. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.46e-7. So sqrt(2.46e-7) is approximately 0.000496. 

Wait, but maybe a more precise calculation. Let me compute sqrt(2.46e-7) more accurately. 

We can write 2.46e-7 as 2.46 * 1e-7. sqrt(2.46) is approximately 1.568. Because 1.568^2 = 2.46. So sqrt(2.46e-7) = 1.568e-3.5, because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is approximately 3.16e-4. So 1.568 * 3.16e-4 = approximately 4.96e-4. So 0.000496. 

So that's correct. So τ is about 79.36 years. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the distance. Wait, maybe the distance is 163,000 light-years? That would change the calculation slightly. Let me recalculate. 

If L0 is 163,000 ly. Then τ would be 163,000 * 0.000496 ≈ 80.8. Still not exactly matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the gamma factor more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for v very close to c. When v is extremely close to c, 1 - v²/c² can be approximated as (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c). But since v is very close to c, (1 + v/c) is approximately 2. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2*(1 - v/c). 

So, 1 - v/c is 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2*0.00000013 = 0.00000026. Hmm, which is a bit different. So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051. So τ = t_earth * 0.00051. 

t_earth is 160,000/0.99999987 ≈ 160,002.08 years. So τ = 160,002.08 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years. That would make it approximately 82 years, which is close to option C)81. But earlier calculation gave about 79 years. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial calculation of t_earth is more accurately computed. Let me compute 160,000 / 0.99999987. 

Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1 + 1.23e-7/(1 - 1.23e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.23e-7 * (1/(1 - 1.23e-7)) ≈ 1 + 1.23e-7*(1 + 1.23e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.23e-7 + 1.5e-14, which is approximately 1.000000123. So t_earth = 160,000 * 1.000000123 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.23e-7). 

160,000 * 1.23e-7 = 160,000 * 0.000000123 = 0.01968. So t_earth ≈ 160,000.01968 years. So negligible difference. So the initial calculation holds. So the astronaut's proper time is around 79.36 years. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option D)77. Hmm, but that's 2.36 years off. Maybe I should consider the exact calculation of sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute it more accurately. 

Let me compute 1 - v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.23e-7 + (1.23e-7)^2. Let me compute each term:

2*1.23e-7 = 2.46e-7.

(1.23e-7)^2 = (1.23)^2 * 1e-14 = 1.5129e-14.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.5129e-14) = 2.46e-7 - 1.5129e-14.

So approximately 2.46e-7. So sqrt(2.46e-7) = sqrt(2.46) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.568 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 4.96e-4. 

So again, τ is 160,000 * 4.96e-4 = 79.36 years. So no change.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the distance is different. Let me reread the problem. Oh wait, the question says the destination is Earth. How far is the LMC from Earth? I thought it's about 160,000 ly, but perhaps the actual distance is different. 

Wait, according to current knowledge, the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the astronaut's proper time is about 79.36 years. The options are 77, 72, 81. So 79.36 is closer to 80, but the closest option is 77 and 81. Hmm, but perhaps the initial assumption is that I should consider the trip time from the Earth's frame, but the astronaut would age less.

Wait, the question says: how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach Earth. So the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is about 79 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +79= 101 years old, which is way under their 150-year lifespan. So they would live. So option A is wrong.

So the time is around 79 years. The options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D)77 years, but why? Maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Or perhaps the calculation requires a different approach.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given v = 0.99999987c, so beta = v/c =0.99999987.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) 

Beta is 0.99999987. Let's compute beta squared: beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.999999740001.

So 1 - beta^2 = 0.000000259999.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.59999e-7) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma is 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.15.

Wait, that's a huge gamma! So the time experienced by the astronaut is t_earth / gamma. So t_earth is about 160,000 years. So τ = 160,000 / 1960.15 ≈ 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.4 years. 

Wait, that's a different approach. Hmm, so which is correct? Oh wait, no. The proper time τ is t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma. Wait, no:

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / gamma. So τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So if t_earth is 160,000, then τ = 160,000 * 0.000496 ≈79.36. But if gamma is 1960, then τ =160,000 / 1960 ≈81.4. 

Wait a minute, the two approaches are giving different results. That can’t be right. So where is the mistake?

Wait, let's clarify: Time dilation equation is τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). Correct. So with t_earth =160,000, sqrt(1 - beta^2)=0.000496, τ= 79.36. 

Alternatively, using gamma = 1960, τ = t_earth / gamma → 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4. 

So which is correct? Hmm, I think I must have made an error in computing gamma. Let me compute gamma correctly. 

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). 

Beta = 0.99999987.

Beta squared is approximately 0.9999997400000001.

So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0000002599999999.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2)=sqrt(2.599999999e-7)= approx 0.0005099. 

So 1/sqrt is 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960. So tau is 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4. 

Wait, that's a conflict. Because earlier calculation using t_earth * sqrt gives 79.36, but using t_earth / gamma gives 81.4. So something's wrong. 

Wait, no. Wait, the time in Earth's frame is t_earth = 160,000 years. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So that's 79.36. 

But using gamma = 1960, the relationship is t_earth = gamma * tau. So tau = t_earth / gamma → 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4. 

So which is correct? There must be a miscalculation in either the gamma or the initial approach. 

Ah! Wait, I think I messed up the definition of gamma. Let me re-express:

In the Earth frame, the time is t_earth, and the astronaut's time is tau. 

The relationship between the two is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma. 

So if gamma is 1960, then tau = t_earth /1960 = 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4 years. 

But earlier calculation when I multiplied 160,000 * 0.000496 gave 79.36, which is different. 

Wait, why the discrepancy? Let's compute the sqrt(1 - beta^2) and 1/gamma numerically. 

If gamma is 1960.15, then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is 1/1960.15 = 0.00050985. 

So 160,000 * 0.00050985 = 160,000 * 5.0985e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00050985 = 81.576 years. 

Ah, so my initial calculation of sqrt(1 - beta^2) was wrong. Because I thought it was about 0.000496, but it's actually 0.00050985. 

Wait, so why did I get 0.000496 earlier? Oh because when I computed 1 - beta^2 as 2.46e-7, but in reality, it's 2.599e-7. So that's where the error was. 

Wait, let me recalculate: sqrt(2.599e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.599e-7). 

sqrt(2.599e-7) = sqrt(2.599) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 → 1.612 * 0.00031623 ≈ 0.0005098. 

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is approximately 0.0005098. 

So tau = 160,000 * 0.0005098 → 160,000 * 0.0005098 = 81.568 years. 

Ah, so the correct proper time is about 81.57 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years. 

So the options are C)81 years. So the correct answer is C. 

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of 1 - beta^2. Because beta was 0.99999987, so beta^2 is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that accurately. 

(0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999987 *0.99999987. Let me compute this:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987 = (1 - 1.23e-7) * (1 - 1.23e-7) = 1 - 2*(1.23e-7) + (1.23e-7)^2 = approximately 1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.5e-14. 

So 1 - beta^2 = 2.46e-7. Wait, no: wait, beta^2 is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001. So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0000002599999999, which is 2.599999999e-7. So yes, 2.6e-7 approximately. 

So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 0.0005098. 

So tau is 160,000 *0.0005098 = 81.57 years. 

Which is about 81.57, so option C is 81 years. 

Wait, but why did I get 79.36 earlier? Because I mistakenly computed 1 - beta^2 as 2.46e-7, which was incorrect. 

So the correct answer is approximately 81 years. So option C is the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we must account for time dilation due to the spacecraft traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years. 

### Step 1: Time in Earth's frame
The time taken for the journey as observed from Earth is given by:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c}
\]

Since \( v \approx c \), \( t_{\text{Earth}} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \). A more precise calculation gives:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} \approx 160,000 \times 1.000000123 \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Proper time experienced by the astronaut
The proper time \( \tau \) experienced by the astronaut is related to \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) by the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \times \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001,
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 = 0.0000002599999999.
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.0000002599999999} \approx 0.0005098.
\]

Now, calculate \( \tau \):

\[
\tau = 160,000 \times 0.0005098 \approx 81.57 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The astronaut's proper time is approximately \( 81.57 \, \text{years} \), which is closest to option **C) 81 years**. 

### Step 4: Verify feasibility
The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifetime of 150 years. After traveling for \( \tau \approx 81 \, \text{years} \), the astronaut would be \( 22 + 81 = 103 \, \text{years} \) old, which is well within their expected lifespan. Thus, they would survive the journey.

### Conclusion
The time it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth, from their perspective, is approximately **81 years**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. 

So, the problem says that an astronaut is 22 years old and is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Oh, wait, but the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. 

Wait, time dilation has two effects here. There's the time experienced by the astronaut, which would be less due to their high velocity. Also, there's the distance they need to cover. I think the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Wait, I remember that the LMC is roughly about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. 

So first, I need to find out how long the trip takes from Earth's frame of reference. Because the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, the time it would take in Earth's frame is distance divided by speed. So time_earth = distance / speed. 

Distance is 160,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c, so in units, since speed is in terms of c, the calculation would be 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let me compute that. 

Wait, 160,000 divided by approximately 1. Because 0.99999987 is almost 1. Let me compute it more accurately. 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. So multiplying 160,000 by that gives about 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013). Let me compute 160,000 * 1.3e-7. Hmm, 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 0.00000013 = 0.0208. So approximately 160,000.0208 years? So about 160,000 years as seen from Earth. 

But wait, that's a really long time. But the astronaut is 22 years old and their average lifetime is 150 years. So if it takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would have aged 160,000 years, which is way beyond their lifespan. But wait, that's from Earth's frame. The astronaut's own clock would tick slower. 

Oh, right, because of time dilation. So the proper time experienced by the astronaut is less than the time in Earth's frame. The proper time τ is given by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. 

v is 0.99999987c. So v² is (0.99999987)^2 * c². So v²/c² is approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. 

(1 - 1.23e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.23e-7 + (1.23e-7)^2. Probably, the last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.46e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.46e-7). Let me compute that. 

Wait, 2.46e-7 is 2.46 * 1e-7 = 0.000000246. The square root of that is sqrt(0.000000246). Hmm, sqrt(0.00000025) is 0.0005, because (0.0005)^2 is 0.00000025. So sqrt(0.000000246) is a bit less than 0.0005. 

Wait, 0.0005 is 5e-4. Let me compute 5e-4 squared: 2.5e-7. Wait, but our value is 2.46e-7, which is a bit less than 2.5e-7. So sqrt(2.46e-7) is about 0.000496. Let me think: 0.000496^2 is (4.96e-4)^2 = (4.96)^2 * 1e-8 = about 24.6 * 1e-8 = 2.46e-7. Yes, so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is approximately 0.000496. 

So τ = t * 0.000496. And t is the time from Earth's frame, which is about 160,000 years. So τ = 160,000 * 0.000496 ≈ 79.36 years. 

Wait, so the astronaut would experience about 79.36 years of their own time. But the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old. So they would age about 79 years. Their lifespan is 150 years, so 22 +79 is 101, which is within their lifespan. But wait, the question is, how long will it take from the astronaut's perspective to reach Earth. So the answer is approximately 80 years. 

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years, option D is 77. Hmm. So my calculation is 79.36, which is close to 80. Wait, perhaps I made an approximation. Let me double-check. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact Lorentz factor. Let me compute gamma which is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²). So v is 0.99999987 c. So v/c is 0.99999987. So 1 - (v/c)^2 is 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that more accurately. 

Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 is 1 - 2*(1.23e-7) + (1.23e-7)^2. So that's 1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.51e-14. The last term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.46e-7. 

So 1 - v²/c² is approximately 2.46e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.46e-7) as before, which is 0.000496. 

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute (1 -v²/c²) = (1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 ≈ 0.0000002599999999. 

Wait, 0.99999987 squared is (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.23e-7 + (1.23e-7)^2. Let me compute 2*1.23e-7 = 2.46e-7. The square is (1.23e-7)^2 = ~1.5e-14, negligible. So 1 - 2.46e-7 ≈ 0.9999997534, so 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997534 = 0.0000002466. 

So sqrt(0.0000002466) = sqrt(2.466e-7). Let me compute that. I know that sqrt(2.5e-7) is approximately 0.0005, as before. But 2.466 is a bit less. So 0.000496 as before. 

So again, τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 0.000496 ≈ 79.36 years. So approximately 79.36 years. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 77 years and C) 81 years. Hmm. So 79.36 is closer to 79, but the options don't have 79. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I made an error in the distance. 

Wait, the distance: Is the Large Magellanic Cloud really 160,000 light-years away? Or is it about 160,000? I think it's about 160,000 light-years. Let me confirm. Oh wait, no, I think the actual distance is about 160,000 light-years. So that part is right. 

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the time from the spaceship's perspective using the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. So the proper length is the Earth to LMC distance, which is 160,000 ly. But in the spaceship's frame, the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, no. Proper length is the length in the rest frame, which is Earth's frame. So the length L0 is 160,000 ly. The moving observer (astronaut) would see the distance as L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time experienced by the astronaut is L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v. 

Wait, let me compute that. So L0 is 160,000 ly. So L = 160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ly. Then time τ = L / v = (160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) / v. Since v is 0.99999987 c. 

Wait, let's compute this. So τ = (160,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)) ) / (0.99999987 c) * c / c → the units will cancel, and it's in years because L is in light-years. 

Wait, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is same as before, 0.000496. So τ = (160,000 * 0.000496) / 0.99999987 ≈ (79.36) / 0.99999987 ≈ 79.36 years. 

Same result as before. So the astronaut would experience about 79.36 years. So the options are 77, 72, 81, or 81 is the closest. So maybe 79 rounds to 80, but the options don't have 80. So perhaps the calculation is approximated. 

Wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation of 160,000 * 0.000496. Let me compute 160,000 * 0.000496. 160,000 * 0.0004 is 64. 160,000 * 0.000096 is 15.36. So total is 64 +15.36 =79.36. Right. 

So about 79.36 years. The options given are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77. So the closest is not exactly an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in any step?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Let me compute 1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2. 

0.99999987 is equal to 1 - 1.23e-7. So squaring this: (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2. Where a is 1.23e-7. So 1 - 2*(1.23e-7) + (1.23e-7)^2. So 1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.51e-14. The last term is negligible. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.46e-7. So sqrt(2.46e-7) is approximately 0.000496. 

Wait, but maybe a more precise calculation. Let me compute sqrt(2.46e-7) more accurately. 

We can write 2.46e-7 as 2.46 * 1e-7. sqrt(2.46) is approximately 1.568. Because 1.568^2 = 2.46. So sqrt(2.46e-7) = 1.568e-3.5, because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is approximately 3.16e-4. So 1.568 * 3.16e-4 = approximately 4.96e-4. So 0.000496. 

So that's correct. So τ is about 79.36 years. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the distance. Wait, maybe the distance is 163,000 light-years? That would change the calculation slightly. Let me recalculate. 

If L0 is 163,000 ly. Then τ would be 163,000 * 0.000496 ≈ 80.8. Still not exactly matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the gamma factor more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for v very close to c. When v is extremely close to c, 1 - v²/c² can be approximated as (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c). But since v is very close to c, (1 + v/c) is approximately 2. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2*(1 - v/c). 

So, 1 - v/c is 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2*0.00000013 = 0.00000026. Hmm, which is a bit different. So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051. So τ = t_earth * 0.00051. 

t_earth is 160,000/0.99999987 ≈ 160,002.08 years. So τ = 160,002.08 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years. That would make it approximately 82 years, which is close to option C)81. But earlier calculation gave about 79 years. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial calculation of t_earth is more accurately computed. Let me compute 160,000 / 0.99999987. 

Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1 + 1.23e-7/(1 - 1.23e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.23e-7 * (1/(1 - 1.23e-7)) ≈ 1 + 1.23e-7*(1 + 1.23e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.23e-7 + 1.5e-14, which is approximately 1.000000123. So t_earth = 160,000 * 1.000000123 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.23e-7). 

160,000 * 1.23e-7 = 160,000 * 0.000000123 = 0.01968. So t_earth ≈ 160,000.01968 years. So negligible difference. So the initial calculation holds. So the astronaut's proper time is around 79.36 years. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option D)77. Hmm, but that's 2.36 years off. Maybe I should consider the exact calculation of sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute it more accurately. 

Let me compute 1 - v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.23e-7 + (1.23e-7)^2. Let me compute each term:

2*1.23e-7 = 2.46e-7.

(1.23e-7)^2 = (1.23)^2 * 1e-14 = 1.5129e-14.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.5129e-14) = 2.46e-7 - 1.5129e-14.

So approximately 2.46e-7. So sqrt(2.46e-7) = sqrt(2.46) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.568 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 4.96e-4. 

So again, τ is 160,000 * 4.96e-4 = 79.36 years. So no change.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the distance is different. Let me reread the problem. Oh wait, the question says the destination is Earth. How far is the LMC from Earth? I thought it's about 160,000 ly, but perhaps the actual distance is different. 

Wait, according to current knowledge, the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the astronaut's proper time is about 79.36 years. The options are 77, 72, 81. So 79.36 is closer to 80, but the closest option is 77 and 81. Hmm, but perhaps the initial assumption is that I should consider the trip time from the Earth's frame, but the astronaut would age less.

Wait, the question says: how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach Earth. So the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is about 79 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +79= 101 years old, which is way under their 150-year lifespan. So they would live. So option A is wrong.

So the time is around 79 years. The options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D)77 years, but why? Maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Or perhaps the calculation requires a different approach.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given v = 0.99999987c, so beta = v/c =0.99999987.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) 

Beta is 0.99999987. Let's compute beta squared: beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.999999740001.

So 1 - beta^2 = 0.000000259999.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.59999e-7) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma is 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.15.

Wait, that's a huge gamma! So the time experienced by the astronaut is t_earth / gamma. So t_earth is about 160,000 years. So τ = 160,000 / 1960.15 ≈ 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.4 years. 

Wait, that's a different approach. Hmm, so which is correct? Oh wait, no. The proper time τ is t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma. Wait, no:

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / gamma. So τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So if t_earth is 160,000, then τ = 160,000 * 0.000496 ≈79.36. But if gamma is 1960, then τ =160,000 / 1960 ≈81.4. 

Wait a minute, the two approaches are giving different results. That can’t be right. So where is the mistake?

Wait, let's clarify: Time dilation equation is τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). Correct. So with t_earth =160,000, sqrt(1 - beta^2)=0.000496, τ= 79.36. 

Alternatively, using gamma = 1960, τ = t_earth / gamma → 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4. 

So which is correct? Hmm, I think I must have made an error in computing gamma. Let me compute gamma correctly. 

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). 

Beta = 0.99999987.

Beta squared is approximately 0.9999997400000001.

So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0000002599999999.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2)=sqrt(2.599999999e-7)= approx 0.0005099. 

So 1/sqrt is 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960. So tau is 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4. 

Wait, that's a conflict. Because earlier calculation using t_earth * sqrt gives 79.36, but using t_earth / gamma gives 81.4. So something's wrong. 

Wait, no. Wait, the time in Earth's frame is t_earth = 160,000 years. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So that's 79.36. 

But using gamma = 1960, the relationship is t_earth = gamma * tau. So tau = t_earth / gamma → 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4. 

So which is correct? There must be a miscalculation in either the gamma or the initial approach. 

Ah! Wait, I think I messed up the definition of gamma. Let me re-express:

In the Earth frame, the time is t_earth, and the astronaut's time is tau. 

The relationship between the two is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma. 

So if gamma is 1960, then tau = t_earth /1960 = 160,000 /1960 ≈81.4 years. 

But earlier calculation when I multiplied 160,000 * 0.000496 gave 79.36, which is different. 

Wait, why the discrepancy? Let's compute the sqrt(1 - beta^2) and 1/gamma numerically. 

If gamma is 1960.15, then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is 1/1960.15 = 0.00050985. 

So 160,000 * 0.00050985 = 160,000 * 5.0985e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00050985 = 81.576 years. 

Ah, so my initial calculation of sqrt(1 - beta^2) was wrong. Because I thought it was about 0.000496, but it's actually 0.00050985. 

Wait, so why did I get 0.000496 earlier? Oh because when I computed 1 - beta^2 as 2.46e-7, but in reality, it's 2.599e-7. So that's where the error was. 

Wait, let me recalculate: sqrt(2.599e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.599e-7). 

sqrt(2.599e-7) = sqrt(2.599) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 → 1.612 * 0.00031623 ≈ 0.0005098. 

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is approximately 0.0005098. 

So tau = 160,000 * 0.0005098 → 160,000 * 0.0005098 = 81.568 years. 

Ah, so the correct proper time is about 81.57 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years. 

So the options are C)81 years. So the correct answer is C. 

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of 1 - beta^2. Because beta was 0.99999987, so beta^2 is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that accurately. 

(0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999987 *0.99999987. Let me compute this:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987 = (1 - 1.23e-7) * (1 - 1.23e-7) = 1 - 2*(1.23e-7) + (1.23e-7)^2 = approximately 1 - 2.46e-7 + 1.5e-14. 

So 1 - beta^2 = 2.46e-7. Wait, no: wait, beta^2 is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001. So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0000002599999999, which is 2.599999999e-7. So yes, 2.6e-7 approximately. 

So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 0.0005098. 

So tau is 160,000 *0.0005098 = 81.57 years. 

Which is about 81.57, so option C is 81 years. 

Wait, but why did I get 79.36 earlier? Because I mistakenly computed 1 - beta^2 as 2.46e-7, which was incorrect. 

So the correct answer is approximately 81 years. So option C is the correct choice.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we must account for time dilation due to the spacecraft traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years. 

### Step 1: Time in Earth's frame
The time taken for the journey as observed from Earth is given by:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c}
\]

Since \( v \approx c \), \( t_{\text{Earth}} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \). A more precise calculation gives:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} \approx 160,000 \times 1.000000123 \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Proper time experienced by the astronaut
The proper time \( \tau \) experienced by the astronaut is related to \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) by the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \times \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001,
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 = 0.0000002599999999.
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.0000002599999999} \approx 0.0005098.
\]

Now, calculate \( \tau \):

\[
\tau = 160,000 \times 0.0005098 \approx 81.57 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The astronaut's proper time is approximately \( 81.57 \, \text{years} \), which is closest to option **C) 81 years**. 

### Step 4: Verify feasibility
The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifetime of 150 years. After traveling for \( \tau \approx 81 \, \text{years} \), the astronaut would be \( 22 + 81 = 103 \, \text{years} \) old, which is well within their expected lifespan. Thus, they would survive the journey.

### Conclusion
The time it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth, from their perspective, is approximately **81 years**.

**Answer: C**
