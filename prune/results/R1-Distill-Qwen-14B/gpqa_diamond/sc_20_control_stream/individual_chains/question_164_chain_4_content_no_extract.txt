Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, binary stars, eclipses, radial velocities... I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but here it's about binary stars.

So the question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Oh wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. I think the period here refers to the orbital period of the binary system.

The spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, 15 and 10 km/s. RV amplitude is the maximum velocity each star has towards or away from us due to their orbit. The larger the mass of the companion, the higher the velocity, I think. Or wait, no, maybe the mass relates to the velocity in a specific way because of Kepler's laws.

Wait, I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit. So the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass. So the more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity because it's moving less in the orbit. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star.

So for each system, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So m1/m2 = v2/v1. Wait, because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 (since the center of mass is the balance point). So yes, mass ratio is inverse of velocity ratio.

So for each system, I can find the mass ratio between the two stars. Then, the total mass of the system is m1 + m2.

Let me work this out step by step.

First, system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s, v2=5 km/s.

Mass ratio m1/m2 = v2 / v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half the mass of m2. Or wait, wait no. Let me think again. The more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if m1 is the more massive, its velocity is smaller. So in system_1, star 1 has velocity 10, star 2 has 5. So star 1 is less massive than star 2? Because v1 is larger. Wait, no, because m1*v1 = m2*v2. So if v1 is larger, m2 must be larger than m1.

Wait, m1*v1 = m2*v2 → m1/m2 = v2/v1. So yes, m1 is (v2/v1) times m2. So in system_1, m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m2 is twice as massive as m1.

So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

Alternatively, system_1's total mass is (m1 + m2) = m1(1 + 2) = 3 m1.

Wait, but m1 is the mass of star 1, and m2 is the mass of star 2. So m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

Similarly, for system_2: v1=15, v2=10.

m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So m1 is two-thirds the mass of m2. So m2 is 1.5 times m1.

So the total mass of system_2 is m1 + m2 = m1 + 1.5 m1 = 2.5 m1.

Wait, but here m1 is for system_2, right? So in system_2, the masses are m1 and m2, so their total is m1 + m2 = (m2/1.5) + m2 = m2*(1 + 1.5) = 2.5 m2.

Wait, perhaps I should define variables more clearly. Let me try again.

For system_1:

Let’s call the two stars m1 and m2.

Their velocities are v1 =10, v2=5.

From m1*v1 = m2*v2 → m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5 → m1 = 0.5 m2.

So total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Alternatively, m2 = 2 m1. So M1 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

Wait, but I think it's better to express M1 in terms of the velocities.

Because in any case, I need the ratio between M1 and M2. So perhaps I can find the ratio of their total masses.

Wait, let me think about the formula.

The mass function comes into play here. I remember that from radial velocity measurements, the mass function can be used to determine the mass ratio.

The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:

f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 )

But since both stars are observed, perhaps we can get the mass ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the total mass in a binary system:

M = (4 π²/G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

Wait, but I don't have the semi-major axes. Hmm. Another approach: Since the two stars orbit their common center of mass, the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses.

So the mass ratio (m1/m2) = (v2/v1).

Wait, no, I think it's m1/m2 = v2/v1.

Because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 → m1/m2 = v2/v1.

So for each system, compute this mass ratio and find the total mass.

Wait, for system_1:

m1/m2 = v2 / v1 =5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half of m2.

Thus, m2 = 2 m1.

Total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

For system_2:

v1=15, v2=10.

m1/m2 =10/15 = 2/3 ≈0.6667.

So m1= (2/3) m2.

Total mass M2 = m1 + m2 = (2/3) m2 + m2 = (5/3) m2.

But I need to find M1 / M2.

So M1 =3 m1.

But let me express M1 in terms of m2.

Wait, in system_1, m2 is twice m1. So m1 = m2/2.

So M1 =3 m1 =3*(m2/2)= (3/2) m2.

Wait, but wait, that's mixing the m2 from system_1 with the m2 from system_2. That's not correct because they are separate systems. So perhaps I should find another way to relate their masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass ratio between the two systems can be found using the mass function or another relation involving the orbital period.

Wait, the formula for the mass function is:

f(m) = (v1^3 P) / (2 π G )

But that gives the mass function, which is dependent on the inclination. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume that the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1. So perhaps that's a way to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is proportional to (v1 + v2) * (v1^2 + v2^2) / (P^2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total mass in terms of the velocities and the period.

The formula for the total mass of a binary system can be written as:

M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, let's think again. The orbital period P is the same for both stars. The velocity of each star is v1 and v2, so the total velocity (sum) is v1 + v2. But since each star's orbit has a circumference of 2π a_i, where a_i is the semi-major axis of each star's orbit, the sum of their semi-major axes is the separation a = a1 + a2.

The velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P.

So v1 = (2 π a1) / P → a1 = (v1 P)/(2 π )

Similarly, a2 = (v2 P)/(2 π )

The separation a = a1 +a2 = (v1 +v2) P/(2 π )

The total mass M can be found using Kepler's third law: M = (4 π² a^3 )/( G P² )

Substituting a:

M = (4 π² [ (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) ]^3 ) / ( G P² )

Simplify this:

= (4 π² ( (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 )/( (2 π)^3 )) ) / ( G P² )

= (4 π² (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 ) ) / (8 π^3 G P² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (4 π² ) * (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ G P² )

= (4/(8)) * (π² / π³) ) * (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 / ( G P² )

= (0.5) * (1/π) ) * (v1 +v2)^3 P / G

So M = ( (v1 +v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Hmm, that's a formula for the total mass.

So for each system, M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Since G is a constant, when comparing the masses of system_1 and system_2, we can take the ratio.

So M1 / M2 = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Because G and 2 π are the same for both.

So let's compute this ratio.

Given:

System_1:

v1 =10, v2=5 → sum is 15 km/s.

P1 = 2 years.

System_2:

v1=15, v2=10 → sum is 25 km/s.

P2 = 1 year.

So,

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )

Compute 15^3: 15*15=225, 225*15=3375.

25^3: 25*25=625, 625*25=15625.

So,

M1/M2 = (3375 * 2) / (15625 * 1 )

= 6750 / 15625

Compute 6750 / 15625.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 54 / 125.

54/125 = 0.432.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4 or D) ~0.7.

Wait, 0.432 is approximately 0.43, which is closer to 0.4 than 0.7. But looking at the options:

Options:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

0.43 is approximately 0.43, which is between 0.4 and 0.5. So which is the closest option? 0.43 is 0.43, which is 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (0.43-0.4=0.03) than to 0.5 (0.43-0.5=0.07). But the options don't have 0.5. The options are A: 0.4, D: 0.7.

Wait, 0.43 is about 0.4. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate 15^3 and 25^3.

15^3 = 3375 yes.

25^3 = 15625 yes.

So (15^3 * 2) = 3375 * 2 = 6750.

(25^3 * 1) =15625.

6750 /15625 = ?

Let me compute it as a decimal.

6750 divided by 15625.

Well, 15625 * 0.4 = 6250.

6750 -6250=500.

So 0.4 + 500/15625.

500/15625 = 0.032.

So 0.4 +0.032=0.432.

So 0.432 is approximately 0.43.

So the factor is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4, so option A.

Wait but wait, the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if M1/M2 is 0.43, system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

Wait, but the calculation gives M1/M2≈0.43. So system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. So the factor is ~0.43 times. So the answer would be option A: ~0.4.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I messed up the definition of M1 and M2. Let me check again.

Wait in the formula, the M is the total mass for each system. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, but let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the formula?

Another possible approach: The mass function is f(m) = (v^3 P)/(2 π G), but that's only for one component. Wait, perhaps I should consider the mass function for each system.

Wait, in a binary system, the mass function f(m) is given by f(m) = (v1^3 P) / (2 π G (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio m2/m1.

Wait, perhaps that's a better formula to use. Let me try that.

The mass function is:

f(m) = (v^3 P) / (2 π G (1 + q)^2 )

But since f(m) is only a function of the observed velocity (v1), the inclination (i), and the masses, and we don't know the inclination, but in eclipsing binaries, i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, but I should double-check.

Wait, I think my approach earlier was correct because the formula I derived for M is M = ( (v1 +v2)^3 * P )/( 2 π G )

So, for each system, the mass is proportional to (v1 +v2)^3 * P.

So the ratio M1/M2 is ( (v1_1 +v2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (v1_2 +v2_2)^3 * P2 )

Yes.

So, M1/M2 = (15^3 *2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 *2 ) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750 /15625 = 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A, ~0.4.

But looking at the options, option D is ~0.7, which is higher than 0.43.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again about the formula for the mass.

The formula I derived: M = ( (v1 + v2 )^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Is that correct?

Alternative approach: The total mass of the binary system can also be expressed as:

M = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

But a is the separation between the two stars, and a = a1 +a2.

Also, a1 = (v1 * P )/(2 π )

a2 = (v2 * P )/(2 π )

So a = (v1 +v2 ) * P/( 2 π )

Substituting into M:

M = (4 π² ( (v1 +v2) P/(2 π) )^3 ) / ( G P² )

= (4 π² ( (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 )/( (2 π )^3 ) )) / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator:

(4 π²) * (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 ) ) = (4/8) * ( π² / π^3 ) ) (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 )

= (0.5) (1/π ) (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 )

So,

M = (0.5 (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 ) / ( G π P^2 )

Simplify:

= (0.5 (v1 +v2)^3 P ) / ( G π )

Which is the same as M = ( (v1 +v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

So yes, the formula I used earlier is correct.

Thus, M1/M2 = (15^3 *2) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 *2 ) / (15625 ) = 6750/15625 = 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

So it's 0.43 times, which is about 0.4 times. So the answer would be option A.

But let me read the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So 0.43 is close to 0.4, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that in each system, the ratio of the velocities gives the inverse ratio of the masses.

Wait, let me compute the total mass another way.

For system_1:

v1=10, v2=5. So m1/m2 =5/10=0.5.

So m1 =0.5 m2. So M1= m1 +m2= 1.5 m2.

Similarly, for system_2:

v1=15, v2=10. So m1/m2 =10/15=2/3.

So m1= (2/3) m2.

M2= m1 +m2= (2/3 +1 ) m2= (5/3) m2.

So M1=1.5 m2 (from system_1), but wait, m2 is for system_1. But in system_2, m2 is a different value.

Wait, perhaps this is getting confusing because I'm using m2 for both. Let me better denote the masses as m1_1, m2_1 for system_1, and m1_2, m2_2 for system_2.

So for system_1:

m1_1 / m2_1 = v2_1 / v1_1 =5/10=0.5.

So m1_1=0.5 m2_1.

M1= m1_1 + m2_1= 0.5 m2_1 + m2_1=1.5 m2_1.

For system_2:

m1_2 / m2_2= v2_2 /v1_2=10/15=2/3 ≈0.6667.

So m1_2= (2/3) m2_2.

M2= m1_2 +m2_2= (2/3 m2_2 + m2_2 )= (5/3) m2_2.

Now, to find the ratio M1/M2.

But I need to relate m2_1 and m2_2. How?

Because the periods are different, and the velocities are different, it's unclear.

Wait, but how else could we relate the masses?

Hmm, perhaps using the period and the velocity to find the separation, then using Kepler's third law to find the mass.

But that might not be necessary because the previous approach using the mass formula gave M1/M2=0.432.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the velocity amplitudes and the period can be used to find the mass ratio.

Wait, perhaps the formula for mass ratio is (v1 * M_total )/(v2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The formula I used earlier gives M1/M2=0.432, which is ~0.43. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4. So the correct option is A.

But let me double-check the calculation.

15^3 is 15*15=225, 225*15=3375. Correct.

25^3 is 25*25=625, 625*25=15625. Correct.

3375 *2=6750. Correct.

15625 *1=15625.

6750/15625 = let me compute this as a decimal.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270/625.

270 divided by 625:

625 goes into 270 zero times. Add decimal point.

625 into 2700: 4*625=2500 → 4, remainder 200.

Bring down next zero: 2000.

625*3=1875. So 3 → 1875. Remainder 125.

Bring down zero: 1250.

625*2=1250. So 2.

So the decimal is 0.432.

So yes, 0.432 is approximately 0.43, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and the total mass of the binary system. The formula for the total mass of a binary system is:

\[
M = \frac{(v_1 + v_2)^3 P}{2 \pi G}
\]

where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since \(G\) and \(2 \pi\) are constants, the ratio of the masses of the two systems can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(v_1^{(1)} + v_2^{(1)})^3 P_1}{(v_1^{(2)} + v_2^{(2)})^3 P_2}
\]

### Step 1: Input the given values
- For system_1:
  - \(v_1^{(1)} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_2^{(1)} = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
  - \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)
  - Total velocity: \(v_1^{(1)} + v_2^{(1)} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)

- For system_2:
  - \(v_1^{(2)} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_2^{(2)} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
  - \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)
  - Total velocity: \(v_1^{(2)} + v_2^{(2)} = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)

### Step 2: Compute the mass ratio
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}
\]

First, calculate the cubes:
\[
15^3 = 3375, \quad 25^3 = 15625
\]

Now compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625 \cdot 1} = \frac{6750}{15625}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The mass ratio \(M_1 / M_2 = 0.432\), meaning system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Comparing this to the options provided:
- A) ~0.4
- B) ~0.6
- C) ~1.2
- D) ~0.7

The closest value is **A) ~0.4**.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
