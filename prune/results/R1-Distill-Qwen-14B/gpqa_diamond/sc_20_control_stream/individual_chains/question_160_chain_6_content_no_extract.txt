Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. 

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me think. So, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern you get depends on the shape of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minima are at a certain angle, but this is a polygon with N sides, and they say N is infinitely large. Oh wait, if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So maybe I'm supposed to use the single-slit diffraction formula here.

Wait, but wait. The problem says all apothems are the same length. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a regular polygon. So for a regular polygon with N sides, each side has the same length, and the apothem 'a' is the same for each. So when N is very large, the polygon's sides are almost like a continuous curve, making it effectively a circle. So perhaps the problem reduces to the single-slit diffraction case.

In single-slit diffraction, the condition for minima is given by a sinθ = mλ/2, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. But wait, for a circular aperture, it's more like the single-slit formula because the width of the slit determines the minima. Wait, no, actually, wait. Circular apertures lead to different patterns, like the Airy disk. But in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction), for a single slit, the intensity minima occur at sinθ = mλ / (a), where 'a' is the width of the slit. But wait, in some sources, the formula is a sinθ = mλ where m is integer. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the single-slit diffraction minima condition is given by a sinθ = mλ, where 'a' is the slit width, and m is 1, 2, etc. So the first minimum (m=1) would be at θ where sinθ = λ/(a). But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but if it's the first and second minima, their angular positions would be θ1 and θ2, so the difference would be θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but in single-slit, the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(a), and the second at θ2 = 2λ/(a). So the angular separation would be (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/(a). But that's assuming that the angles are small, so sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ (in radians). So θ is approximately λ/(a), and the difference between first and second minima would be λ/(a). Wait, but wait, let me check the options. Option B says 0.500 λ/a, option C is 1.220 λ/a, but wait, I thought the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a). Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait another thought. For a single slit of width 'a', the condition for minima is a sinθ = m λ, where m is 1, 2, etc. So the first minimum is at θ1 = arcsin(λ/(a)), and the second at θ2=arcsin(2λ/(a)). But when a is much larger than λ, the angles are small, so sinθ ≈ θ. So θ1 ≈ λ/(a), θ2≈2λ/(a). The difference is θ2-θ1 = λ/(a). But that's an angular separation of λ/a. But looking at the options, none of them directly have λ/a except option B and D. But option B is 0.500 λ/a, D is 0.506. So that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait! Wait, in single-slit diffraction, the first minimum is at m=1, so a sinθ = λ. So θ = λ/(a). But wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as a sinθ = m λ, and sometimes as a sinθ = m (λ/2), I'm not sure. Let me think again. No, the standard single-slit minima condition is a sinθ = m λ, for m=1,2,3,...

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the minima condition is different, right? Because a circular aperture has a different diffraction pattern, the Airy disk. The minima occur at a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, for m=1,2,3,... But wait, that's for the zeros of the Bessel function, which in the far field for circular apertures lead to the minima at those positions. So the first minimum would be at m=1: a sinθ = (1.5)λ, so θ ≈ (3λ)/(2a) when angles are small. But wait, that's for circular. But in this problem, the polygon becomes a circle as N approaches infinity, so perhaps the correct formula is the circular one.

Wait, but wait. Let's get back to the problem. The problem states that the apertures are N-sided, with all apothems of length 'a'. So the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the width (or the diameter) would be 2 times the apothem times tan(π/N), but for a polygon with very large N, the width approaches 2a because tan(π/N) is approximately π/N, so 2a*(π/N) ≈ 2a as N approaches infinity. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the apothem is related to the radius of the circumscribed circle. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

In a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. The radius R of the circumscribed circle (distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a' (or diameter 2a? Or radius 'a'?) Wait, if the apothem is 'a', then the radius of the circumscribed circle is a / cos(π/N), which approaches a as N is large. So the radius is 'a', so the diameter is 2a.

But wait, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is different. The minima in the far field are given by the zeros of the Bessel function, which for the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(a), as I thought earlier. But wait, that's the first minimum, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For circular apertures, the minima are at θ_m = (x_m λ)/(a), where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum (m=1) is at x_1 ≈ 3.8317, but wait no, that's for the J1 function. Wait, no, wait. The minima in the far field for a circular aperture occur at θ where a sinθ = x_m λ/(2), with m=1, 2, etc. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is such that J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. The zeros of J1 occur at x_m ≈ m π, but more accurately, the first zero of J1 is at x≈3.8317, the second at x≈7.0156, etc. So the minima are at a sinθ = x_m λ/(2π). So for m=1, a sinθ = (3.8317) λ/(2π) → approximately (3.8317/(2π)) * λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a. So θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a. Similarly, the second minimum is at m=2: a sinθ= (7.0156) λ/(2π) → θ ≈ (7.0156/(2π)) λ/a ≈ 1.118 λ/a. So the angular distance between first and second minima would be 1.118 - 0.610 = 0.508 λ/a. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is very close to this value.

But wait, the problem says that N is infinitely large, so the aperture becomes a circle. So the angular separation between the first and second minima should be approximately 0.506 λ/a, which matches option D. But wait, wait, let me double-check. Because for the circular case, the first minima are at θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) and θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). The difference is (7.0156-3.8317) λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) λ/(2π a) ≈ 3.1839/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506 λ/a. So that's correct.

But wait, what if the problem is not about a circular aperture? Because I'm assuming that as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. But perhaps the approach is different. Alternatively, maybe it's treated as a single slit, but the width is related to the apothem.

Wait, perhaps I should model the aperture as a single slit whose width is 'a'. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a polygon with N sides, as N becomes large, the width of the slit (in the direction perpendicular to the sides) is approximately 2a.

Wait, no. For a regular polygon with N sides, the width in the direction of the sides is 2a. Because the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is like the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a large N, when the polygon becomes a circle, the width of the slit (the diameter) would be 2a. So the slit width is 'a' because the apothem is 'a'? Or wait, the slit width would be twice the apothem times something. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: For a polygon with N sides, each side has a length s. The apothem is a = (s/2) cot(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cot(π/N) ≈ N/π. So s ≈ 2 a sin(π/N) ≈ 2 a (π/N) → s ≈ 2a π / N. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so each side becomes infinitesimal, but the total perimeter becomes 2π R, where R is the radius. Wait, but the apothem for a polygon is a = R cos(π/N). So as N→infinite, a ≈ R (1 - (π²)/(2 N²} ), so R approaches a. So the radius of the circle is a.

Therefore, the diameter is 2a. So if the aperture is a single slit of width 2a, then in single-slit diffraction, the condition for minima is (2a) sinθ = m λ → sinθ = m λ/(2a). The first minimum is at m=1 → sinθ = λ/(2a). So θ ≈ λ/(2a). The second minimum is at m=2 → sinθ=2λ/(2a)= λ/a. So θ≈λ/a. So the angular separation between the first and second minima is (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) ) = λ/(2a).

That would be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B. But earlier, considering the circular case, I got 0.506 λ/a, which is option D. So now I'm confused because depending on whether the problem is modeled as a single slit or as a circular aperture, the answer changes.

But the problem states that the aperture is a polygon whose apothems are all 'a'. So when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle with apothem 'a', which implies the radius R is a/(cos(π/N)) → a as N approaches infinity. So the diameter is 2a, which would make the slit width for single-slit diffraction 2a. But wait, wait, perhaps I have to model this as a single slit of width 2a. Then, the minima would be at (2a) sinθ = m λ → θ = m λ/(2a) for m=1,2,...

So the first minima are at θ1=λ/(2a) (m=1), θ2=2λ/(2a)=λ/a (m=2). The separation is θ2 - θ1 = λ/(2a). So 0.5 λ/a. That's option B. But earlier, when I thought it's a circular aperture, I got 0.506 λ/a. Now I'm confused. Which model is correct here?

Wait, the problem says 'far field region' which is the Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the far field pattern is an Airy disk with minima at certain angles. For a single slit, it's different. But the question says that the apertures are N-sided polygons, and N is very large. So whether it's treated as a single slit or a circle might affect the answer.

Wait, but the problem says 'aperture' which is a 2D shape. Wait, perhaps when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture, not a single slit.

But another thought: perhaps the polygon is being treated as a periodic structure, but I'm not sure. Maybe the approach is to model the polygon as an array of slits or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is being considered as a rectangular aperture. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Fraunhofer diffraction for a polygon. But considering N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the far field diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture. So the minima would occur at the angles where the Bessel functions' zeros are. So the first minimum is at approximately 1.22 λ/(a), but wait, earlier I thought the separation between first and second minima is about 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a rectangular slit, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that the apothems are the same. So perhaps the width of the slit (the dimension perpendicular to the direction of the light) is 2a. So the slit width is 2a. So the single-slit condition would be a sinθ = m λ/2. Wait, no, the standard single-slit formula is a sinθ = m λ, where 'a' is the slit width. So if the width is 2a, then the condition is (2a) sinθ = m λ → sinθ = m λ/(2a). So for m=1, θ1 = λ/(2a), m=2, θ2 = λ/a. The separation is λ/(2a). So that's 0.5 λ/a. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of the polygon as a circle, I got 0.506 λ/a. So perhaps the correct approach is to model it as a single slit of width 2a, leading to the answer option B.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think again. The question says, when N is infinitely large, what's the angular distance between the first two minima.

In single-slit, the minima are at θ = m λ/a, if 'a' is the slit width. So the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2, so their angles would be λ/a and 2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. But wait, that's not matching any of the options except if 'a' is the half-width.

Wait, perhaps 'a' is the half-width, so the full width is 2a. Then the minima would be at θ = (m λ)/(2a). So the first two minima are at θ1=λ/(2a), θ2=2λ/(2a) = λ/a. The separation is λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But earlier, when considering the circular case, the separation was about 0.506 λ/a. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the answer depends on whether the polygon becomes a circle (so circular diffraction) or a single slit of width 2a. But the question says the polygon's apothems are all 'a', which for a circle would imply the radius is 'a'. So the diameter is 2a. So perhaps the width is 2a, and the single-slit formula applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is being treated as an array of slits, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another approach: when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. But what's the relation between the apothem and the radius? The apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. The radius of the circumscribed circle is R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the diameter is 2a. So the width of the aperture (the slit) is 2a. So the single-slit formula applies, with 'a' being the half-width, so full width is 2a.

So, using the single-slit condition, the minima are at (2a) sinθ = m λ → sinθ = m λ/(2a). So for m=1, θ1 = λ/(2a), m=2, θ2 = 2λ/(2a) = λ/a. The separation is θ2 -θ1 = λ/(2a). So 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But earlier I thought when the aperture is circular, it's about 0.506. So which is it?

Wait, but the question says, when the light falls on the aperture, which is a polygon, what's the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the pattern is more like a single slit, with the width being 2a. So the answer would be 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But wait, the options include option C:1.220 λ/a. That's the first minimum for a circular aperture. So perhaps the question is about when N becomes infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the first minimum is at 1.220 λ/a, but that's the position of the first minimum, not the separation between first and second.

Wait, but the question is about the separation between the first two minima. So if the first minimum is at 1.220 λ/a, and the second is at 2 * 1.220 λ/a? That doesn't make sense because for a circular aperture, the minima are not equally spaced. So the separation isn't constant.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the positions and their differences. Let me recast the problem. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, i.e., the angle between the first and the second minimum.

Wait, maybe I should recast the problem in terms of diffraction. For a circular aperture, the minima in the far field are given by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first zero is at x1=3.8317, so the first minimum occurs at a sinθ = x1 λ / (2π). So θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (1.220 λ)/a. The second zero is at x2=7.0156, so θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (1.118 λ)/a. So the angular separation between first and second minima is θ2 -θ1 = (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(2π a) = 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a. So that's option D.

But earlier, when I thought of the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, the separation would be 0.5 λ/a.

So why the discrepancy? It depends on whether the polygon becomes a circular aperture (leading to Bessel function zeros) or a single slit (leading to single-slit minima). 

The problem states that the shape is a polygon, but N is infinitely large, making it a circle. So the correct approach is to model it as a circular aperture, leading to the angular separation of approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another thought: when the polygon becomes a circle, the central maximum is wider and the minima are at the positions given by the zeros of the Bessel function. But is the first minimum (the smallest angle) in the same place as a single slit?

No, because the single-slit minimum is at θ=λ/(2a) for a slit of width 2a, but the first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ≈1.22 λ/a. That's a much larger angle. So perhaps the question is not about the separation between the first and second minima in the Bessel function zeros, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is being modeled as a rectangular aperture, but that's not indicated in the question.

Wait, maybe I should think again about the polygon's properties. The apothems are all length 'a'. So the polygon is regular, and each side has the same apothem. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a' (since the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which approaches the radius of the circumscribed circle as N increases).

In the case of a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer) is the Airy disk. The minima occur at the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, so the first minimum occurs at θ where a sinθ = (3.8317) λ/(2π). The second zero is at approximately 7.0156, so the second minimum is when a sinθ = (7.0156) λ/(2π). 

The angular separation between these two minima is the difference in θ values. So θ1 = (3.8317) λ/(2π a) ≈ (1.220 λ)/(a). θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (1.118 λ)/a. The difference is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (1.118 - 1.220) λ/a → wait, wait no, that can't be right because 7.0156 is larger than 3.8317, so θ2 is larger than θ1. So the separation is 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839. So 3.1839/(2π) → which is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

So the answer should be option D.

But earlier, when considering a single slit of width 2a, I got 0.5 λ/a. So which approach is correct?

The question is about an aperture shaped as a polygon with N sides, and when N is very large, it's a circle. So the correct model is the circular case, leading to the answer D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we consider an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\). As \(N\) approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern is determined by the Airy disk, which arises from the far-field diffraction of a circular aperture.

For a circular aperture, the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern occur at angles where the argument of the Bessel function \(J_1\) is zero. The zeros of \(J_1\) are approximately \(x_m \approx 3.8317, 7.0156, \dots\). The condition for the minima is given by:

\[
a \sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi},
\]

where \(a\) is the radius of the circular aperture, \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the light, and \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the angular positions of the minima are approximately:

\[
\theta_m \approx \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The first minimum occurs at \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second minimum occurs at \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). The angular separation between the first and second minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a} - \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Substituting \(x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839\), we find:

\[
\Delta\theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\), which corresponds to option D.

**Critical analysis of the options:**
- **Option A (\(0.610 \lambda / a\))**: This value does not match the calculated separation between the first and second minima for a circular aperture.
- **Option B (\(0.500 \lambda / a\))**: This value corresponds to the separation between minima for a single-slit diffraction pattern, but the problem specifies a circular aperture as \(N \to \infty\), so this is incorrect.
- **Option C (\(1.220 \lambda / a\))**: This is the angular position of the first minimum for a circular aperture, not the separation between the first and second minima.
- **Option D (\(0.506 \lambda / a\))**: This matches the calculated angular separation between the first and second minima for a circular aperture and is therefore correct.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{D}
