Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out the solution step by step.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it usually forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right, that's the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group.

So the reaction would be a ketone adding HCN. But wait, the reagent here is NaCN. I think that in such reactions, the cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile. The carbonyl group in butan-2-one would attack the CN- nucleophile. But for that, the carbonyl might need to be activated. Wait, no, I think the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but the reagent is NaCN. So maybe the solution is adding an acid to protonate the carbonyl. Because NaCN is a source of CN-, but without acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed efficiently. Oh wait, but sometimes such additions can happen under basic conditions as well. Hmm. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, and in the presence of a strong acid, the carbonyl oxygen would get protonated, making the carbonyl more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN plus A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The product is a cyanohydrin, which forms when a carbonyl reacts with HCN. So the reagent A is probably an acid that protonates the carbonyl, making the reaction go.

Looking at the options, the possible reagents A are H3O+ (which is a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4), or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, but bisulfite is more commonly used in the addition to carbonyl groups, like in the benzoin condensation or in other reductions, but in this case, maybe it's used as a source of bisulfite ions, which can act as a base or a nucleophile.

Wait, no, perhaps in the formation of cyanohydrin, the reagent is an acid catalyst. So NaCN is the nucleophile, and H3O+ (like HCl) is the acid catalyst. That would make sense. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the structure would have a nitrile group (CN), a hydroxyl (OH), and the rest of the chain.

The product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is converting a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. I think that involves hydrolysis. But wait, under what conditions does a nitrile get hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid?

Nitrile hydrolysis can occur under acidic or basic conditions. Usually, under strong acidic conditions with heat, a nitrile can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it might form a sodium salt of the carboxylic acid, which can then be acidified.

Wait, but the starting material in reaction two is a nitrile with a neighboring hydroxyl group. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is part of the same carbon as the nitrile, making it a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile.

Wait, but I'm looking at the product, which is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is H2O, but under what conditions?

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O, but I think the actual reagent would be an acid or a base in the reaction. Wait, the question states that reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, looking back, the question shows that the second reaction is with B, and B is H2O. Or wait, looking at the question again: the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So perhaps B is the reagent, and H2O is the solvent? Or maybe B is the acid or base used along with H2O.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

The second reaction is written as:

[compound] + B (H2O) → [product]

So the reagent B is used in the presence of water. Hmm.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So maybe the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. But in the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent, perhaps the conditions are different.

But the starting material already has an OH group on the same carbon as the CN. So perhaps it's more about converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid via hydrolysis.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. How is that done? Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed under strong acidic (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) or strong basic (like NaOH, H2O, heat) conditions. In acidic conditions, the product is the carboxylic acid. In basic conditions, you get the carboxylate ion, which would need acid work-up to get the acid.

But looking at the options for reagent B, the choices include HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Wait the options for B are if A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH, perhaps as an acid.

So for the second reaction, to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, we might need an acid catalyst. So if the reaction is H2O as solvent and an acid as catalyst, then HCl or acetic acid could be the reagents.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions would require something like concentrated H2SO4 and heat, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe under reflux with H2O and HCl. Or maybe using a milder acid like acetic acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So if the reaction is done under acidic conditions, the product would be the acid directly.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D). So which is correct?

Alternatively, wait, maybe the second reaction is not a hydrolysis of the nitrile, but perhaps some other reaction.

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which has both OH and CN groups on the same carbon. That's a cyanohydrin. When you hydrolyze a nitrile group adjacent to an alcohol, perhaps there's a different pathway.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile under basic conditions, but since the OH is present, perhaps it can act as a leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann or Curtius type rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting the nitrile to a ketone via hydrolysis, but that doesn't fit the product given.

Wait, the product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. So it's a four-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group. So the starting nitrile must have been R-CN, which after hydrolysis becomes R-COOH.

So in this case, the nitrile is at the end, so the hydrolysis would directly give the carboxylic acid.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps with some acid or base. If it's HCl (a strong acid), then the conditions are acidic. Alternatively, if it's acetic acid (a weak acid), then maybe it's a milder acid.

In the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So which would be correct for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically occurs under strong acidic or strong basic conditions. So if HCl is used, that's a strong acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid. So maybe under strong acid conditions (HCl) the reaction occurs.

So in the second reaction, B is HCl.

Wait, but looking back at the options for B, only options A and C have B as HCl. So in the options, A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. C is A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, but then for the first reaction, which reagent is correct.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. As I thought earlier, the addition of NaCN to a ketone would require an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So in that case, A would be H3O+, which is option A or B. So the first part of the problem, A is H3O+.

So if the first part requires A to be H3O+ (so either options A or B), and the second part requires B to be HCl (so options A or C), then the only option that has both A as H3O+ and B as HCl is option A.

But wait, looking at the product of the second reaction: it's 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converted to a COOH group.

Wait, but wait—could the presence of the hydroxyl group in the starting material (2-hydroxybutanenitrile) affect the hydrolysis? Or is it possible that the hydroxyl group is oxidized? Hmm, but oxidation of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is via hydrolysis, not oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is part of the structure and doesn't interfere.

So for the second reaction, the reagent is H2O and reagent B. If B is HCl, the conditions are acidic, which would favor the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, using H2O with HCl as a catalyst. So the second part would need HCl as B.

So putting it together, for the first reaction, A is H3O+, and for the second, B is HCl. So the correct option would be A.

Looking back at the options, option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, another possibility: the second reaction could be hydrolysis under basic conditions. Let me think again. If the reagent is H2O and a base, like NaOH, but looking at the options, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. Neither is a base. So if B is a base, it's not among the options. So perhaps the second reaction is under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, wait, another approach: the first reaction is the formation of the cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+.

Now, for the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. Let me think about how that could happen. Maybe via hydrolysis with an acid.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions can be done using H2O with HCl as a catalyst. So, in that case, B would be HCl.

So in the second reaction, the reagent is HCl in water. So the correct option is A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl group more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion (CN⁻). Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step, as it facilitates the reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. This typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction must proceed under acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl is a strong acid that can catalyze the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid. Therefore, HCl is the suitable reagent for this step.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** for the first reaction and **B = HCl** for the second reaction. This corresponds to option A.
