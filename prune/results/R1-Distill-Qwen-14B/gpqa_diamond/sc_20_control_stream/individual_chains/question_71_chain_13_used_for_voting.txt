Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. I've heard that the TTV method stands for Transit Timing Variation, but I'm not entirely sure how that works. Oh well, maybe that's not directly relevant here. The question is about the temperatures of these planets, so I should focus on the factors that determine equilibrium temperature.

The setup is a system of five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so each planet's orbital period is a multiple of the first. So Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P.

Since they're in resonance and have circular orbits, maybe their distances from the star are related to the square root of their periods? Because I remember Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. For circular orbits, that's the same as the radius.

So Kepler's third law formula is P² ∝ a³, so a ∝ P^(2/3). So each planet's distance from the star depends on their period raised to the 2/3 power.

But wait, equilibrium temperature... Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (Luminosity of star) / (16 * pi * sigma * a²) )^(1/4) ), but wait, since all the planets are around the same star and have the same albedo, then the star's luminosity and albedo are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature depends only on the distance 'a'.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(16 pi a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. So if all the planets have the same albedo, the T ratio between them will depend on their a. So T ∝ (1/a^2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5) = 1/sqrt(a).

So if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then I can find the ratio of T4 to T2. Because T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because T is inversely proportional to a^0.5. So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^0.5. Since a4 is the semi-major axis of Planet_4, which has a period of 3.5P. Similarly, a2 is for Planet_2, period 2P.

So a ∝ P^(2/3), so a2 = (2P)^(2/3), a4 = (3.5P)^(2/3). So the ratio a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, 2 divided by 3.5 is 2/(7/2) )= 4/7. So 4/7.

So (4/7) raised to the 2/3 power. Hmm, but wait, the ratio a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) * (4/7)^(1/3), but that might not be the right way to think. Alternatively, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, yes, because a2 is for P2, a4 for P4. So their ratio is (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So 2/3.5 is 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3).

So the ratio T4/T2 is [ (a2 / a4 ) ]^(1/2).

Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because (4/7)^(2/3) raised to 1/2 is (4/7)^(1/3). Yes.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 4/7.

What's 4/7 approximately? 0.571. So cube root of 0.571.

I know that 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.83^3 is about 0.5715. Wait, 0.83^3 is 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, times 0.83 is approximately 0.5715. Oh, wait, so cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait. Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So T4/T2 is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, T_4 is the temperature of Planet_4. So T4 is ( a2/a4 )^0.5 times T2.

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (2P)^(2/3) / (3.5P)^(2/3) ) )

Which is sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) )

Which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3), as before.

So 4/7 is 0.5714, and the cube root of this is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Because T_4 is (a_2/a_4)^(1/2) times T_2. Since a_4 is larger than a_2 (since 3.5P > 2P), a2/a4 is less than 1. So T4 is less than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is less than one, which matches 0.83.

Alternatively, if I compute T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2), so it's (4/7)^(1/3). So the ratio is about 0.83.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( 1/\sqrt{a} \), where \( a \) is the orbital distance from the star. From Kepler's third law, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4/T_2 \) depends on the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2.

The orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are in the ratio \( 2:3.5 \), or \( 2/3.5 = 4/7 \). Since \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), the ratio of their distances is \( a_2/a_4 = (4/7)^{2/3} \). The equilibrium temperature ratio is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_4}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( 4/7 \approx 0.571 \), the cube root of \( 0.571 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4/T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A)** ~0.57  
**B)** ~0.69  
**C)** ~0.83  
**D)** ~0.75  

The correct answer is **C) ~0.83**.

So a ∝ P^(2/3), so a2 = (2P)^(2/3), a4 = (3.5P)^(2/3). So the ratio a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, 2 divided by 3.5 is 2/(7/2) )= 4/7. So 4/7.

So (4/7) raised to the 2/3 power. Hmm, but wait, the ratio a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) * (4/7)^(1/3), but that might not be the right way to think. Alternatively, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, yes, because a2 is for P2, a4 for P4. So their ratio is (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So 2/3.5 is 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3).

So the ratio T4/T2 is [ (a2 / a4 ) ]^(1/2).

Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because (4/7)^(2/3) raised to 1/2 is (4/7)^(1/3). Yes.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 4/7.

What's 4/7 approximately? 0.571. So cube root of 0.571.

I know that 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.83^3 is about 0.5715. Wait, 0.83^3 is 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, times 0.83 is approximately 0.5715. Oh, wait, so cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait. Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So T4/T2 is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, T_4 is the temperature of Planet_4. So T4 is ( a2/a4 )^0.5 times T2.

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (2P)^(2/3) / (3.5P)^(2/3) ) )

Which is sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) )

Which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3), as before.

So 4/7 is 0.5714, and the cube root of this is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Because T_4 is (a_2/a_4)^(1/2) times T_2. Since a_4 is larger than a_2 (since 3.5P > 2P), a2/a4 is less than 1. So T4 is less than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is less than one, which matches 0.83.

Alternatively, if I compute T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2), so it's (4/7)^(1/3). So the ratio is about 0.83.

So the answer should be option C.

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( 1/\sqrt{a} \), where \( a \) is the orbital distance from the star.

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4/T_2 \) depends on the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2.

The orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are in the ratio \( 2:3.5 \), or \( 2/3.5 = 4/7 \). Since \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), the ratio of their distances is \( a_2/a_4 = (4/7)^{2/3} \). The equilibrium temperature ratio is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_4}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( 4/7 \approx 0.571 \), the cube root of \( 0.571 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4/T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \).
