Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. It kind of reminds me of the metric for a sphere, but maybe modified somehow. Oh right, in general relativity, the metric can tell us about the geometry of the space.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember something about the metric for hyperbolic space. Oh wait, the metric for a hyperbolic plane is usually written in a form like ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²), where a is the radius of curvature. But here, the denominator seems similar but with a minus sign in the denominator.

Wait, the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²), which can be rewritten as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So that's like (x² + y²) over 4, subtracted from 1. So this would be similar to the hyperbolic metric but with a negative curvature.

Let me think about the general form again. The hyperbolic metric in isothermal coordinates is often written as ds² = (4 a²)/( (1 + (x² + y²)/a² )² ) (dx² + dy²), but I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, another parametrization uses a different form. Wait, maybe the given metric is scaled differently.

Wait, the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let's factor out the 4 in the denominator. So that becomes (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) = (8)/( (1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) ). So the metric becomes ds² = [8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, but hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates uses a similar form, but with a plus in the denominator. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model has a metric that's ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²)^2)] (dx² + dy²) or something like that. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Beltrami-Klein model?

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the metric in terms of curvature. The given metric is conformally flat, meaning it's just a scaling of the Euclidean metric. The conformal factor here is (32)/(4 - x² - y²), which is the same as 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4).

The area of a surface in a metric can be found by integrating the area element. In this case, the area element would be dA = sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal and conformally flat, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, the determinant for a 2x2 metric diag(a, a) would be a². So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but the domain of this metric is important. The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive to have real values. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the spatial region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area of the pseudosphere would be the integral of dA over this disk.

Wait, but pseudosphere refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? So the area of a pseudosphere with radius r is 4πr²? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the area of a sphere in 3D is 4πr², but a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) in 2D hyperbolic space... Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up with dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area. So the area would be the double integral over x and y, where x² + y² <4. Let's make this easier by switching to polar coordinates. So x² + y² = r², with r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2 of integral θ=0 to 2π of (32/(4 - r²)) r dθ dr.

Compute the integral: first, the θ integral is from 0 to 2π, which is 2π. So A = 2π ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let's factor out constants. 32 = 16 * 2. So 32 r dr = 32 r dr.

Wait, the integral becomes 32 * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²). Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (r dr)/(u) → which is ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-du/2) ] / u → ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du → which is (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

So that integral is (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to 4. Wait, but as u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to4 of 1/u du is divergent; it's ln(4) - ln(0), but ln(0) is -infinity, so the integral is infinity.

Wait, so the area A would be 32 * (1/2) * [ ln(4) - (-∞) ) ] = 32*(1/2)* (∞) ) = 16 * ∞ = ∞. So the area is infinite. That can't be right because the options include +infty as option D.

Wait, but wait, the metric is given as ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the spatial region is the disk x² + y² <4. So integrating the area element over this region gives an infinite area? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, hyperbolic geometry doesn't work like that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area element.

Wait, no, the area element for a conformally flat metric is correct. The determinant is (32/(4 - r²))² for a 2D metric, but wait, no, wait. If the metric is diag(a, a), then the determinant is a², so the area element is a dx dy. So in this case, a = 32/(4 - r²), so the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. So when you integrate over the disk of radius 2, it's indeed the integral of (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches zero, so the integrand (32/(4 - r²)) r dr becomes very large. So the integral over r from 0 to 2 would diverge. Therefore, the area is infinite. So the answer would be option D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, so perhaps in hyperbolic geometry, the area is infinite? Or did I get the metric wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric represents a pseudosphere, but the area isn't finite.

Wait, I thought that for a hyperbolic plane, the area is infinite, but in the case of a pseudosphere, which is a finite surface, like a tractricoid, the area might be finite. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the hyperbolic plane and a pseudosphere, which is a surface embedded in 3D space.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's finite. Oh wait, but the metric given here might not be the metric of a pseudosphere. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric given is for a 2D surface. So when you have a metric of the form ds² = f(x,y)(dx² + dy²), it's conformally flat. The pseudosphere is a finite surface, but perhaps the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which is infinite.

Wait, so perhaps the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, which is finite. But wait, the question says, "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure about the exact definition here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere, but the area is finite. But according to the calculation I did earlier, the area would be infinite. So perhaps the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, but of a hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area.

Wait, the options include D) +infty, which would suggest that the area is infinite. So the correct answer would be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat and resembles the metric of a hyperbolic plane. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\) implies that the spatial region is the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), with a radius of 2. The area element for this metric is derived as:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \(\theta\) contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), leaving:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr.
\]

This integral diverges as \(r \to 2\), where the denominator \(4 - r^2 \to 0\), causing the integrand to blow up. Substituting \(u = 4 - r^2\) (\(du = -2r \, dr\)) confirms the divergence, as the integral becomes proportional to \(\ln(4/u)\), which approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Thus, the total area is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). While a pseudosphere is a finite surface of constant negative curvature in 3D space, the given metric represents a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Therefore, the correct answer is:
