Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I need to find the energy at which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. Let me think.

So the reaction is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. Right, and the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The question is about the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime is limited by this process. I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, like the CMB, it can produce an electron-positron pair if certain conditions are met.

Wait, annihilation processes are usually about the energy and cross-section. So I think this has to do with the photon-photon cross-section. I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon interactions increases when the center-of-mass energy is above a certain threshold. For producing an electron-positron pair, the center-of-mass energy has to be at least twice the rest mass of an electron, right? So that's 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

But wait, the gamma is high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy. So in the lab frame, the CMB photon is at rest, and the gamma is moving. So the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) needs to be at least 1.022 MeV for the reaction to proceed. To calculate the required energy of the gamma.

The formula for the threshold energy of the photon in such a reaction is given by E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4. Wait, is that right? Because when you have two particles colliding, the threshold condition is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is exactly equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So for e+ e-, that's 2 m_e c^2. So the threshold in the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2.

But how do I relate that to the energies in the lab frame? So in the lab frame, the CMB photon has energy E_cmb, and the gamma photon has energy E_gamma. The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision, which gives the highest possible center-of-mass energy), the momenta would be in the same direction? Wait, no, because in reality, the CMB photons are isotropic, but the gamma is moving through them. So for the maximum possible center-of-mass energy, the two photons are moving directly towards each other. So the momenta would be opposite in direction, so their vector sum would be (p_gamma - p_cmb) if they're in opposite directions.

Wait, the photons are massless, so their energy is E = |p| c. So for two photons moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite. So the total energy squared would be (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma/c - E_cmb/c)^2 c^2. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again.

The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are moving in opposite directions, p2 is opposite to p1. So p1 c + p2 c = (p1 - p2) c, because p2 = -p_cmb. Wait, no, if the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, then its momentum is negative. So p2 = - |p2|.

So let me denote E_gamma as E, and E_cmb as e. The CMB photon has energy e = 1e-3 eV. So E is much larger than e.

The invariant s is (E + e)^2 - (p c - p' c)^2, where p is the momentum of the gamma (E = p c) and p' is the momentum of the CMB photon (e = p' c). Wait, no, the CMB photon has energy e, so its momentum is e/(c). But since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum vector is -e/(c).

So the total momentum vector is p_gamma - p_cmb = (E/(c)) - (e/(c)) ) * direction? Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to compute s.

s = (E + e)^2 - (p_gamma c - p_cmb c)^2.

Since E = p_gamma c, and e = p_cmb c.

So s = (E + e)^2 - ( (E - e) )^2.

Expanding that: (E^2 + 2 E e + e^2 ) - (E^2 - 2 E e + e^2 )

Which simplifies to 4 E e.

So s = 4 E e.

At threshold, sqrt(s) should be equal to 2 m_e c^2.

So,

sqrt(4 E e) = 2 m_e c^2.

Square both sides:

4 E e = (2 m_e c^2 )^2.

Simplify,

E e = (m_e c^2 )^2.

So E = (m_e c^2 )^2 / e.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So (m_e c^2 )^2 would be (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

e is 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but units need to be consistent. So let's compute this.

First, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e c^2 squared is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

E = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = ( (0.511)^2 * 1e12 ) / 1e-3 ) eV.

Wait, let's compute that:

(0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261.

So 0.261 * 1e12 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 1e12 divided by 1e-3 is 1e15.

So E ≈ 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, the options are in GeV and higher.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV). So approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check the steps.

Wait, I had E * e = (m_e c^2 )^2.

E = (m_e c^2 )^2 / e.

Yes, that's correct.

So m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 eV^2.

e = 1e-3 eV.

So E = (0.261e12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 261,000 GeV = 2.61e5 GeV. So option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

Yes, that seems right.

To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, we analyze the threshold condition for this reaction. The center-of-mass energy must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in this process is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_\gamma$ and $p_{\text{CMB}}$ are their momenta. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, the momenta cancel partially, simplifying $s$ to:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

At the threshold, the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ equals $2m_e c^2$, so:

\[
\sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2 \implies s = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Equating the two expressions for $s$:

\[
4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Solving for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV $= 0.511 \times 10^6$ eV, and the average energy of the CMB photon is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3}$ eV. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV:

\[
E_\gamma = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option C, which is $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision, which gives the highest possible center-of-mass energy), the momenta would be in the same direction? Wait, no, because in reality, the CMB photons are isotropic, but the gamma is moving through them. So for the maximum possible center-of-mass energy, the two photons are moving directly towards each other. So the momenta would be opposite in direction, so their vector sum would be (p_gamma - p_cmb) if they're in opposite directions.

Wait, the photons are massless, so their energy is E = |p| c. So for two photons moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite. So the total energy squared would be (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma/c - E_cmb/c)^2 c^2. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again.

The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are moving in opposite directions, p2 is opposite to p1. So p1 c + p2 c = (p1 - p2) c, because p2 = -p_cmb. Wait, no, if the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, then its momentum is negative. So p2 = - |p2|.

So let me denote E_gamma as E, and E_cmb as e. The CMB photon has energy e = 1e-3 eV. So E is much larger than e.

The invariant s is (E + e)^2 - (p c - p' c)^2, where p is the momentum of the gamma (E = p c) and p' is the momentum of the CMB photon (e = p' c). Wait, no, the CMB photon has energy e, so its momentum is e/(c). But since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum vector is -e/(c).

So the total momentum vector is p_gamma - p_cmb = (E/(c)) - (e/(c)) ) * direction? Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to compute s.

s = (E + e)^2 - (p_gamma c - p_cmb c)^2.

Since E = p_gamma c, and e = p_cmb c.

So s = (E + e)^2 - ( (E - e) )^2.

Expanding that: (E^2 + 2 E e + e^2 ) - (E^2 - 2 E e + e^2 )

Which simplifies to 4 E e.

So s = 4 E e.

At threshold, sqrt(s) should be equal to 2 m_e c^2.

So,

sqrt(4 E e) = 2 m_e c^2.

Square both sides:

4 E e = (2 m_e c^2 )^2.

Simplify,

E e = (m_e c^2 )^2.

So E = (m_e c^2 )^2 / e.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So (m_e c^2 )^2 would be (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

e is 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but units need to be consistent. So let's compute this.

First, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e c^2 squared is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

E = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = ( (0.511)^2 * 1e12 ) / 1e-3 ) eV.

Wait, let's compute that:

(0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261.

So 0.261 * 1e12 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 1e12 divided by 1e-3 is 1e15.

So E ≈ 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, the options are in GeV and higher.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV). So approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check the steps.

Wait, I had E * e = (m_e c^2 )^2.

E = (m_e c^2 )^2 / e.

Yes, that's correct.

So m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 eV^2.

e = 1e-3 eV.

So E = (0.261e12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 261,000 GeV = 2.61e5 GeV. So option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

Yes, that seems right.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, we analyze the threshold condition for this reaction. The center-of-mass energy must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in this process is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_\gamma$ and $p_{\text{CMB}}$ are their momenta. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, the momenta cancel partially, simplifying $s$ to:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

At the threshold, the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ equals $2m_e c^2$, so:

\[
\sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2 \implies s = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Equating the two expressions for $s$:

\[
4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Solving for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV $= 0.511 \times 10^6$ eV, and the average energy of the CMB photon is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3}$ eV. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV:

\[
E_\gamma = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option C, which is $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV.
