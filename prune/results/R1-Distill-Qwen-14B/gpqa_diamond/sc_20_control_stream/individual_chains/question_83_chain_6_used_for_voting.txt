Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, the base will neutralize the acid. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water, right?

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so 0.05 M for 0.02 liters (20 cm³) would be 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

After diluting with 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, what happens at 25% titration? Oh, wait. 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.

First, let's find out the moles of acetic acid. As before, it's 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So the NaOH added is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but the volume of NaOH added would be (moles)/(concentration) = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But I'm not sure if I need that immediately.

So, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. Let me model the reaction.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, initial moles: 0.001 mol CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol CH3COOH has reacted. So moles remaining: 0.00075 mol CH3COOH. And moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution has both the weak acid and its conjugate base. This sounds like a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But wait, what's the pKa? The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa = -log(Ka) = log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So, pH = pKa + log(n_A-/n_HA).

Wait, because the concentrations will be in the same ratio as the moles, since the total volume is the same for both (since they're in the same solution). So the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253, which is about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm, that seems close. But let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Let me be precise. Let me calculate pH more accurately.

pKa is 4.73 (since 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10^-5 → pKa is around 4.733).

The ratio is 0.00025 /0.00075 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.256. So approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, so moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But the total volume at equivalence point is original solution (40 cm³) plus 10 cm³ NaOH → 50 cm³.

At equivalence point, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So to find the pH, I can compute the concentration of acetate ions, then find Kb, then find [OH-], then pH.

First, the concentration of acetate. At equivalence, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, wait. Wait, double-check: initial 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³ total volume. Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate ion can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute it: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, let's consider the hydrolysis reaction:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be tiny).

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / (0.02).

Set up equation: x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Take square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.29e-6).

Compute log(3.29e-6): log(3.29) is approx 0.517, so 0.517 -6 = -5.483 → but since it's 3.29e-6, the pOH is 5.483.

Wait, wait. Wait, no: pOH is -log(3.29e-6). Let me compute it accurately. Log(3.29) is about 0.517, so log(3.29e-6) = 0.517 -6 → -5.483. So pOH = 5.483.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517 → approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So the first part matches the 25% titration pH, and the equivalence point is 8.52. That would make option A the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the equivalence point calculation again. Did I make a mistake in getting the Kb?

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → let me compute that more precisely. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1/(1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10, yes that's correct.

So the Kb is correct. Then, the calculation of [OH^-] is correct, leading to pOH of 5.48, pH of 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. So why would another option be considered?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me double-check that part.

Wait, 25% titration refers to the volume of titrant added, not the moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in titration, 25% might refer to the percentage of the acid neutralized. Or perhaps, it's the amount of base added in terms of moles.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So 25% titration would mean 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So, that's correct.

So the initial calculation of 4.25 is right, which matches option A’s first value.

But wait, let me think about the dilution step again. When we add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the new concentration is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when we add 25% of the required NaOH, which is 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is strong, it will neutralize that amount of acetic acid.

So, the moles of acetic acid left are 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025. So the ratio is 1/3, as before.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253, which is 4.25, so 4.26 when rounded to two decimal places.

At equivalence, the pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So why is that? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the 25% titration refers to the volume of NaOH added, not the moles. Wait, but 25% of the required volume, not the moles. Let me think.

The total moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. The reaction is 1:1, so the required NaOH moles are 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L (10 cm³).

So 25% of that volume would be 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which is 25% of the required 0.001 mol. So same as before. So the initial calculation still holds.

Wait, but perhaps the 25% titration refers to the volume of the titrant added relative to the total solution. Wait, no, I think the usual way is that the percentage refers to the amount neutralized, so moles.

So I think the first part is correct. So option A, 4.26 and 8.52, is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dilution was miscalculated.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.001 mol.

Then, adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Another thought: when adding the NaOH, the total volume increases. For the 25% point, the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, but wait, the Henderson calculation is based on moles, not concentrations, so the ratio remains the same. Therefore, the volume doesn't affect the ratio, so the pH is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the equivalence point again. When all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is 0.001 mol of acetate ion in 50 cm³ of solution. So 0.02 M. Then, Kb is 5.405e-10, so [OH-] is sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. pOH is about 5.48, pH about 8.52. So that's correct.

So the only option that matches both 4.26 and 8.52 is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Here's the detailed breakdown:

---

### **Initial Setup**
- **Volume and concentration of acetic acid**: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³. The new concentration is:  
  \[
  \text{New concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- Moles of acetic acid neutralized:  
  \[
  0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Remaining moles of acetic acid:  
  \[
  0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed:  
  \[
  0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- The solution is a buffer, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right).
  \]
  The \( K_a \) of acetic acid is \( 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so:  
  \[
  \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73.
  \]
  The ratio of acetate to acetic acid is:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]
  Substituting into the equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
  \]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions.  
- Moles of acetate ion:  
  \[
  0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Total volume of the solution:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- Concentration of acetate ion:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The \( K_b \) for acetate is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
  Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \):  
  \[
  x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
  \]
  \[
  x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  This \( x \) is the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \).  
  - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48 \).  
  - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52 \).

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, the base will neutralize the acid. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water, right?

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so 0.05 M for 0.02 liters (20 cm³) would be 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

After diluting with 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, what happens at 25% titration? Oh, wait. 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.

First, let's find out the moles of acetic acid. As before, it's 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So the NaOH added is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but the volume of NaOH added would be (moles)/(concentration) = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But I'm not sure if I need that immediately.

So, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. Let me model the reaction.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, initial moles: 0.001 mol CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol CH3COOH has reacted. So moles remaining: 0.00075 mol CH3COOH. And moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution has both the weak acid and its conjugate base. This sounds like a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But wait, what's the pKa? The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa = -log(Ka) = log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So, pH = pKa + log(n_A-/n_HA).

Wait, because the concentrations will be in the same ratio as the moles, since the total volume is the same for both (since they're in the same solution). So the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253, which is about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm, that seems close. But let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Let me be precise. Let me calculate pH more accurately.

pKa is 4.73 (since 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10^-5 → pKa is around 4.733).

The ratio is 0.00025 /0.00075 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.256. So approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, so moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But the total volume at equivalence point is original solution (40 cm³) plus 10 cm³ NaOH → 50 cm³.

At equivalence point, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So to find the pH, I can compute the concentration of acetate ions, then find Kb, then find [OH-], then pH.

First, the concentration of acetate. At equivalence, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, wait. Wait, double-check: initial 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³ total volume. Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate ion can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute it: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, let's consider the hydrolysis reaction:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be tiny).

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / (0.02).

Set up equation: x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Take square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.29e-6).

Compute log(3.29e-6): log(3.29) is approx 0.517, so 0.517 -6 = -5.483 → but since it's 3.29e-6, the pOH is 5.483.

Wait, wait. Wait, no: pOH is -log(3.29e-6). Let me compute it accurately. Log(3.29) is about 0.517, so log(3.29e-6) = 0.517 -6 → -5.483. So pOH = 5.483.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517 → approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So the first part matches the 25% titration pH, and the equivalence point is 8.52. That would make option A the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the equivalence point calculation again. Did I make a mistake in getting the Kb?

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → let me compute that more precisely. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1/(1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10, yes that's correct.

So the Kb is correct. Then, the calculation of [OH^-] is correct, leading to pOH of 5.48, pH of 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. So why would another option be considered?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me double-check that part.

Wait, 25% titration refers to the volume of titrant added, not the moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in titration, 25% might refer to the percentage of the acid neutralized. Or perhaps, it's the amount of base added in terms of moles.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So 25% titration would mean 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So, that's correct.

So the initial calculation of 4.25 is right, which matches option A’s first value.

But wait, let me think about the dilution step again. When we add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the new concentration is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when we add 25% of the required NaOH, which is 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is strong, it will neutralize that amount of acetic acid.

So, the moles of acetic acid left are 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025. So the ratio is 1/3, as before.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253, which is 4.25, so 4.26 when rounded to two decimal places.

At equivalence, the pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So why is that? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the 25% titration refers to the volume of NaOH added, not the moles. Wait, but 25% of the required volume, not the moles. Let me think.

The total moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. The reaction is 1:1, so the required NaOH moles are 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L (10 cm³).

So 25% of that volume would be 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which is 25% of the required 0.001 mol. So same as before. So the initial calculation still holds.

Wait, but perhaps the 25% titration refers to the volume of the titrant added relative to the total solution. Wait, no, I think the usual way is that the percentage refers to the amount neutralized, so moles.

So I think the first part is correct. So option A, 4.26 and 8.52, is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dilution was miscalculated.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.001 mol.

Then, adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Another thought: when adding the NaOH, the total volume increases. For the 25% point, the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, but wait, the Henderson calculation is based on moles, not concentrations, so the ratio remains the same. Therefore, the volume doesn't affect the ratio, so the pH is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the equivalence point again. When all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is 0.001 mol of acetate ion in 50 cm³ of solution. So 0.02 M. Then, Kb is 5.405e-10, so [OH-] is sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. pOH is about 5.48, pH about 8.52. So that's correct.

So the only option that matches both 4.26 and 8.52 is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Here's the detailed breakdown:

---

### **Initial Setup**
- **Volume and concentration of acetic acid**: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³. The new concentration is:  
  \[
  \text{New concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- Moles of acetic acid neutralized:  
  \[
  0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Remaining moles of acetic acid:  
  \[
  0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed:  
  \[
  0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- The solution is a buffer, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right).
  \]
  The \( K_a \) of acetic acid is \( 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so:  
  \[
  \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73.
  \]
  The ratio of acetate to acetic acid is:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]
  Substituting into the equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
  \]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions.  
- Moles of acetate ion:  
  \[
  0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Total volume of the solution:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- Concentration of acetate ion:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The \( K_b \) for acetate is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
  Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \):  
  \[
  x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
  \]
  \[
  x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  This \( x \) is the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \).  
  - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48 \).  
  - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52 \).

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
