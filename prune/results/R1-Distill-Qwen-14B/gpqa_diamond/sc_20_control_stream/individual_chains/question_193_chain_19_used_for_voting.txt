Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the number of stars varying with parallax in a specific region of the sky. The formula given is 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A through D, each with different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is that distance (d) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax (d ≈ 1/plx). So, higher parallax means closer star, lower parallax means farther away.

Wait, but the question here is about the number of stars varying as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N, the number, is inversely proportional to plx^5.

But I need to find how N changes with distance, so I should express N in terms of r, the distance, instead of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, I can solve for plx in terms of d. Plx = 1/d. 

So plx = 1/d. Let's substitute that into N. N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 over that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait. Because when the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", I think it's asking about the differential: like the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe we're looking for dN/dr, the rate of change.

Wait, alternatively, maybe they're asking about the number density, like how many stars are in a shell of radius r with thickness dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area (4πr²) times the thickness dr, but also multiplied by some function of r. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, let me go back. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/d, then N = k * (d^5). So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number per unit distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Let me calculate that.

dN/dd = derivative of d^5 is 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

But wait, the options don't have a 4 exponent, let me check the options again. Options are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2. Oh, option C is r^4. So that would be the change per unit distance, right?

Wait, but another way: maybe the question is just asking about N as a function of d, not the derivative. So if N ∝ d^5, then the number increases with the fifth power of distance. But the question says "how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, "per unit range" might imply the rate, which is the derivative. So N per unit distance is 5d^4, so the rate is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region as a function of parallax is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since parallax is plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So more distant regions (higher d) have more stars. But how does that translate when considering the number per unit distance?

If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr would be approximately N * dr. Wait, no, because N is the number in a certain volume, or per unit volume? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think in terms of volume.

Wait, in three dimensions, the number of stars might depend on the volume. But the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So if d is the distance, and plx = 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So N is proportional to (d)^5.

But when they talk about "change with distance per unit range", perhaps they mean the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd =5 d^4. So the change is proportional to d^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is r^4, because per unit distance, the number increases as the fourth power.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's go through it again.

N ∝ 1/plx^5. Substitute plx = 1/d: N ∝ d^5.

So N = k d^5. The rate of change of N with d is dN/dd = 5k d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as d^4. So the answer is C: ~ r^4.

Wait, but another possibility is that the question is considering a fixed volume, like a spherical shell. The number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the number density times the volume. Hmm, but that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the given relation is already accounting for the volume.

Wait, perhaps the N given is the number of stars per unit volume, and the relation is N ∝ d^5. Then, the number of stars in a thin shell would be N * 4π r² dr. But that probably isn't the case here, because the question states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.

Alternatively, maybe the question is more straightforward. It says the number of stars in a region varies as 1/plx^5. So if we consider a thin shell at distance d, the number of stars would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. But for a thin shell, I think the number of stars should also depend on the surface area, which is 4π d². But the given relation doesn't include that, so perhaps the given relation is already considering all factors, like surface density or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is in the way the number of stars varies with parallax. So N = k * (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5.

So if d increases, N increases as d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit distance. So that would be dN/dr. So as I calculated earlier, dN/dr = 5k d^4, which is proportional to d^4. So the correct option is C, r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe the question is asking not about the derivative, but the number of stars per unit distance. So without taking the derivative. So if N is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, N increases by d^5. But that doesn't make much sense because per unit distance would imply the derivative.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the number of stars in a unit distance interval. So if you have a range dr, the number of stars in that range would be proportional to d^5 * dr. So per unit dr, it's proportional to d^5. But that would be if we're integrating over a range. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see what the options are. The options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

If N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit r would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4. So the answer would be C.

So the correct option is C.

The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely related to distance (\(d\)) as \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\). Substituting this into the given relation, we find \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks for how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance (\(r\))". This implies the rate of change of \(N\) with respect to \(r\), which is the derivative \(\frac{dN}{dr}\). Taking the derivative of \(N \propto d^5\), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \(r^4\). Among the given options:

- **A) \(r^3\):** Incorrect, as the derived dependence is \(r^4\), not \(r^3\).
- **B) \(r^5\):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the rate per unit distance.
- **C) \(r^4\):** Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \(r^4\).
- **D) \(r^2\):** Incorrect, as this does not match the derived dependence.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
