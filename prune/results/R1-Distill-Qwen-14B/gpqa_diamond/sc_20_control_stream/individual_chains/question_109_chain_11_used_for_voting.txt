Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem involves two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics impose certain conditions on the quantum numbers of the final state. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final NN state has T(NN)=0. I need to determine which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. The initial state is 1S0, which I think refers to the total spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0 (since S is 1 in 1S0 notation? Wait no, the notation is (2S+1)L J. Oh wait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 must mean S=0 because 2S+1=1 would imply S=0. So initial spin is 0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

The NN system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the final state is the NN state plus X. The Pauli statistics condition relates the isospin T of the final NN state to their spin S, orbital angular momentum L, and parity.

The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T is 0, let's plug that in: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. Which means S and L must be such that their sum is odd. So either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

The question is about which partial wave (i.e., which L for the emitted particle) is not allowed. The options are given as transitions where the emitted particle has a certain angular momentum state, denoted by lowercase letters: p, s, f, etc.

Wait, but in the options, each option shows the initial state (1S0) transitioning to a state with some L and J, plus the emitted particle's state. Like option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p.

Wait, the term after the arrow is the final NN state plus the emitted particle X. So let me parse each option.

Each option is structured as initial state -> final NN state (with L and J) plus the emitted particle X, which has a certain angular momentum.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says the options are of the form (like A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So the left side is the initial state, and the right side is the final state. The final state consists of the NN system and the emitted particle X. So X is emitted, so the NN system must go into a different state.

Wait, the problem says the initial state is 1S0. Then the NN system emits a particle X, so the final state is the NN system in a new state plus X.

Wait, but the options seem to describe the final NN state as the term after the arrow, but perhaps the X is part of the process. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the options list the possible transitions where the partial wave (l) of X is given.

Wait, no. Let me read the note in the problem: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So each option shows the initial state (1S0) and the final state, which is the NN state plus X. Hmm, no, the options are in the form "1S0 -> something + something", where it looks like the first part is the final NN state, and the second part is the emitted particle X.

Wait, perhaps each option lists the initial state, the final NN state, and the emitted particle X's quantum numbers. So for option A, the initial is 1S0, the final NN state is 7D1, and X is a particle in state p (which I think refers to the angular momentum l=1, so p state).

Wait, but how does that fit into the conservation laws? I think I need to look at the angular momentum and parity conservation.

Ok, let's start by considering the whole process. The initial state is NN in 1S0, which has L=0, S=0, J=0. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^L * intrinsic parity. Wait, the intrinsic parity of the NN system? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the initial state is (-1)^L, since for two nucleons, their orbital angular momentum L contributes a parity factor of (-1)^L. But wait, each nucleon has an intrinsic parity. But since they're identical fermions, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric.

Wait, maybe I should think about parity conservation. The initial parity is calculated from the initial state, and the final parity must be the same, considering the parity of X.

The initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L is 0, P_initial = 1.

When the NN emits X, the final state has parity P_final = P_NN_final * P_X. Because X has its own intrinsic parity, which is given as -1. So P_final = P_NN_final * (-1).

But since parity is conserved, P_initial = P_final. So 1 = P_NN_final * (-1). Therefore, P_NN_final = -1.

Wait, but the parity of the final NN state is (-1)^{L_final}. Because the intrinsic parity of the NN system (assuming they are identical particles) would have parity based on their orbital angular momentum. Wait, no. Wait, the parity operator for two particles is (-1)^L * (parity of each particle). Since each nucleon is a fermion with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the NN system would be (-1)^L * (-1)^2 = (-1)^L. Because each has parity -1, and when you exchange both, it's (-1)^2 = 1. So the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L.

So initial parity is (-1)^0 = 1, since L=0. After emission, the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}, and X has intrinsic parity -1. So the overall parity is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_final + 1}.

Since parity is conserved, this must equal the initial parity of 1. So:

(-1)^{L_final + 1} = 1.

Which implies that L_final + 1 must be even. So L_final must be odd.

So L_final is odd.

Now, from the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

We know T(NN) is 0. So 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2.

Which implies S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

Since we found that L is odd, let's substitute. Since L is odd, L ≡1 mod 2.

So S + 1 ≡1 mod 2 → S ≡0 mod 2.

So S must be even.

Wait, but the spin S of the NN system is a non-negative integer. So S can be 0, 1, 2, etc. So S must be even, meaning S=0, 2, 4..., but given that it's a bound system, maybe the maximum S is something like 1 or so. Hmm, perhaps for two nucleons, possible S is 0 or 1. So if S must be even, S=0.

So the final state must have S=0.

But wait, the final state's spin S could be 0 or 1. But according to the condition, S must be even, so S=0.

So, in the final NN state, S must be 0, and L must be odd.

Now, looking at each option:

Each option gives the final NN state as some term, such as 7D1. Let's parse that term.

The term is (2S+1)L J. So for 7D1, 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D which is 2. So S=3, L=2, J=1.

Wait, but we just determined that in the final state, S must be 0. So any option where the final NN state has S≠0 is invalid. So let me check each option:

Option A: 7D1. S=(7-1)/2=3. So S=3. But according to our condition, S must be 0. So this option is not allowed. So it's not permitted, making it a possible answer.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial state has S=0. So when the NN emits a particle, the final NN state must have S=0. Because the condition from Pauli requires S to be 0.

So any option where the final NN state has S≠0 is impossible. So let's go through each option and see what S is.

Option A: 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3. So not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. So S=1, which is odd. But earlier, from the condition, S must be even (0, 2, etc.), but S can't be 1. Wait, earlier condition says S + L must be 1 mod 2. L is odd, so S must be 0 mod 2. So S must be even. So S=1 is odd, which would make S + L=1 +1=2 mod 2 → 0. But the condition requires S + L=1 mod 2. So this wouldn't satisfy. Therefore, the S=1 is invalid.

Wait, wait, in this case, the final NN state's spin S must be 0, because from the condition S must be even, and in the two-nucleon system, the possible S are 0 and 1. So S must be 0.

So any option where the final NN state has S≠0 is invalid.

Option A: S=3 → invalid.

Option B: S=1 → invalid.

Option C: 3D3 → S=(3-1)/2=1 → invalid.

Option D: 3P0 → S= (3-1)/2 =1 → invalid.

Wait, this can't be right. Because all the options except perhaps none have S=0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the term after the "→" is the final state of the emitted particle and the NN. No, the question says "the final NN state has T=0". So the options are about the NN state after emitting X. So each option's first part after the arrow is the final NN state.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them have final NN states with S=3, S=1, etc., so none have S=0. That can't be right, because then the problem would have no correct options. So perhaps I misunderstood the setup.

Wait, perhaps the final NN state's spin is S, but in the term symbol, the (2S+1)L J is written for the NN system. So for each option, the first part after the arrow is the NN state's term.

So in option B: 3S1. 2S+1=3 → S=1. Then L=0 (since it's S), so L=0.

Wait, wait, the term is 3S1. The S here is the orbital angular momentum letter. Oh wait, no, the term symbol is (2S_total +1) L J.

So '3S1' would mean (2S_total +1)=3 → S_total=1. L is 'S', which is 0. So L=0.

Wait, but earlier, we found that L must be odd in the final state. So let me check each option.

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (since D is 2). But L must be odd. So this is even, which is invalid.

Option B:3S1 → L=0. Even, invalid.

Option C:3D3 → L=2. Even, invalid.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 (P is 1). So L is 1, which is odd. So this is valid.

So let's see. Only option D has L=1, which is odd.

But wait, earlier, from the Pauli condition, S must be even because S + L must be 1 mod 2. Since L is 1 (odd), S must be 0 mod 2 (even). So in option D, S=1 (since 3P0's S is 1). Because 3P0 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. So S=1, which is odd, and L=1 (odd). So S+L=2 → 0 mod 2, which doesn't satisfy the condition S + L ≡1 mod 2.

Hmm, so for option D, S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → 0 mod2. Which doesn't match the required 1 mod2. So this can't be allowed.

Wait, but earlier we concluded that L must be odd, and S must be even. So let me see which options have L odd and S even.

Looking at each option:

Option A: L=2 → even. Invalid.

Option B: L=0 → even. Invalid.

Option C: L=2 → even. Invalid.

Option D: L=1 → odd. But S=1 → odd. So S+L=2 → even. So condition not met.

Wait, so none of the options meet the condition. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Pauli condition. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

T is 0, so S + L +1 ≡0 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

So, S and L must add to an odd number.

In the final state, L must be odd (from parity conservation), because L_final must be odd, as we determined earlier.

So, if L is odd, then S must be even (since even + odd = odd), so S must be even.

So, the final NN state must have even S (0, 2, etc.) and L must be odd.

Now, looking at each option's final NN state:

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). So S+L=5 → odd. But L must be odd, but here L=2 is even. So this option has L even, which violates the parity condition. So it's invalid.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1 (odd), L=0 (even). So S+L=1 → odd. But L is even, which violates parity condition, so invalid.

Option C:3D3 → S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=3 → odd. But L is even, which is invalid.

Option D:3P0 → S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). S+L=2 → even. Doesn't meet S+L=1 mod2. But let's check the parity condition. L=1 is odd, which is correct for parity.

So the only option where L is odd is D. But in option D, S=1 (odd), so S + L = 2, which is even. So that doesn't satisfy the condition.

So none of the options meet both conditions. But that can't be, because the question must have one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier steps.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the Pauli condition applies to the total isospin, which is a different consideration, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity argument.

Wait, the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = 1. After emission, the parity is (-1)^L_final * (-1), because X has parity -1. So 1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1).

Which gives (-1)^{L_final} = -1.

So (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final must be odd.

So L_final is odd.

So L must be odd.

Now, in the options, the only one with L odd is option D (L=1).

So option D has L=1.

Now, in option D, the final NN state is 3P0.

So 3P0: 2S+1=3 → S=1.

So S=1, which is odd.

Now, the condition is S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

S=1, L=1 → 1 +1 =2 ≡0 mod2. So condition not met.

So this is invalid.

Hmm, so all options except perhaps none have L odd and S even. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted particle's angular momentum affects the total angular momentum. Wait, but the problem says to consider the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So the total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.

Wait, the initial state has J=0.

After emission, the total angular momentum of the NN system plus X must still be J=0.

Wait, but the problem may not consider the X's angular momentum because it's emitted and is part of the final state. So the initial J is 0. The final state is the NN in state J' plus X in state l. So the total angular momentum must be J' + l = 0? Or perhaps the total angular momentum should be zero.

Wait, no, the total angular momentum is (NN's J) + (X's l) → because X is a boson or fermion with spin, but perhaps for this problem, we're considering the orbital angular momentum, but it's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the initial state has J=0. The final state must have the same J. So the sum of the NN system's J and X's spin (or orbital angular momentum) must be zero. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. So when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum l of X is part of the process.

Wait, but in the options, the emitted particle X is in a state denoted by p, s, f, etc. For example, option A is 7D1 + p. So X is in a p state (l=1).

So the emitted X carries away orbital angular momentum l. The total orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial system has L=0, so the sum of the NN's L_final and X's l must be zero.

Wait, but that's only if we're considering orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, the total angular momentum J is conserved.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the total angular momentum. The initial state has J=0. The final state consists of the NN in a state with J_NN and X in a state with J_X (which includes orbital and spin angular momentum). Since J must be conserved, J_NN + J_X = 0 → J_X = - J_NN. But angular momentum is a vector, so this would require J_NN and J_X to be opposite and equal in magnitude. But this is possible only if J_NN and J_X are both zero, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that in this scenario, the emission of X doesn't change the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the parity and the Pauli condition. Let's go back.

We established that L_final must be odd.

Looking at the options, only option D has L_final=1.

But in option D, S=1, which is odd. So S + L =1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. But the condition requires S + L ≡ 1 mod2. So this doesn't work.

So perhaps option D is invalid.

Wait, but then which option is correct? Because all the others have L even, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity condition.

Wait, let me re-examine the parity conservation.

Initial parity is 1 (since L=0).

The final parity is P_NN * P_X.

P_NN is (-1)^L_final.

P_X is given as -1.

So P_initial = P_NN * P_X → 1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1).

Which simplifies to 1 = (-1)^{L_final + 1}.

So (-1)^{L_final +1} =1 → L_final +1 must be even → L_final is odd.

So yes, L_final is odd.

So the only option with L_final odd is D.

But in option D, S=1 (from 3P0 → S=1), which is odd. So S + L=2 → 0 mod2. Which doesn't match the condition S + L ≡1.

So this option is invalid.

But then, since all other options have L even, which is invalid, so perhaps the correct answer is that option A is invalid because it has L=2, which is even. But earlier, we saw that only option D has L=1, which is odd, but it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the emitted particle's angular momentum affects the total. Because the initial state has total angular momentum J=0, the final state must have total J=0 as well. So the sum of the NN's J and X's J must be zero.

In the options, the emitted X's state is given as p, s, f, etc. These letters refer to the orbital angular momentum l. Do we need to consider the spin of X as well? Hmm, the problem states that X is a particle, but doesn't specify whether it's a boson or fermion. But perhaps the orbital angular momentum is what's relevant here.

So the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l, which is part of the total angular momentum. So the initial J=0 must equal the sum of the NN's J and X's l (plus any spin, but perhaps we're ignoring spin for this part).

Wait, but the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So the total angular momentum must be conserved.

The initial state has J=0. The final state has the NN in state with J_NN and X in state with J_X. So J_NN + J_X =0.

But J is a vector, so their sum must be zero. So J_NN = - J_X.

But J_X includes orbital and spin angular momentum. However, the problem might be simplifying this by considering only orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X must be equal and opposite to the NN's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L, and the X's orbital angular momentum is l. So the total orbital angular momentum is L + l. The initial L was 0, so L + l must be 0 → l = -L.

But orbital angular momentum is quantized, and l must have the same magnitude but opposite direction. But since angular momentum is a vector, the only way for L + l =0 is if l = -L. So l must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, this isn't possible unless both L and l are zero. Because, for example, L=1 and l=1 can't sum to zero because they are vectors in opposite directions but same magnitude. So perhaps their sum can be zero if their magnitudes are the same and directions opposite, but in terms of quantum numbers, this would require L and l to have the same magnitude.

But I'm not sure how this applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the NN's orbital angular momentum is L. Then, the total orbital angular momentum is L + l. Since the initial total was 0, L + l must be 0. So L = -l. But since L and l are magnitudes, this would require L = l. But their directions must be opposite, but in quantum mechanics, the total L and l can only sum to zero if L and l have the same magnitude and opposite direction, but in terms of quantum numbers, this would require L = l. So for example, if the NN's L is 1, the X's l must be 1.

Wait, let me think. So for each option, the NN has L_final. The X has l. Then L_final + l = 0 → L_final = -l. But since L and l are magnitudes, this implies L = l.

So for each option, the X's l must be equal to L_final.

Now, in option D, the final NN state has L=1. So X's l must also be 1, which is a p state. So in option D, X is p (l=1). So L_final=1, X's l=1. So L_final + l = 2, which doesn't sum to zero. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the entire system (NN + X) must be conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So the sum of the NN's L and the X's l must be zero. So L_NN + l_X =0.

So L_NN = - l_X.

But since L and l are magnitudes, L_NN = l_X.

So for each option, the X's l must equal the NN's L.

Let's check each option:

Option A: NN's L=2 (from 7D1 → D is 2). X's l is p →1. So L=2, l=1 → 2≠1. So this would violate angular momentum conservation. So this option is invalid.

Option B: NN's L=0 (3S1 → S=0). X's l is s→0. So 0=0. Valid.

Option C: NN's L=2 (3D3 → D=2). X's l is f→3. So 2≠3. Invalid.

Option D: NN's L=1. X's l is p→1. So 1=1 → valid.

So options B and D have L_NN = l_X, so angular momentum is conserved.

Now, considering the Pauli condition:

For each option, check if S + L ≡1 mod2.

Option B: S=1 (from 3S1), L=0. S+L=1 →1 mod2. Which satisfies the condition.

But earlier, from parity, L must be odd, which in option B is 0 → even. So parity condition not met. So option B is invalid.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 →0 mod2. Doesn't satisfy condition. So invalid.

Wait, but option B's Pauli condition is satisfied, but parity condition isn't. Option D's parity condition is satisfied, but Pauli isn't.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find which option violates either the parity or the Pauli condition.

Wait, but the problem states that both conditions must be satisfied. So the forbidden partial wave is the one that violates either condition.

So, considering the options:

Option A: L=2 (even) → parity condition violated. So forbidden.

Option B: L=0 (even) → parity condition violated. Forbidden.

Option C: L=2 (even) → parity condition violated. Forbidden.

Option D: L=1 (odd) → parity condition satisfied.

But in option D, S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → 0 mod2 → Pauli condition not satisfied. So this option violates the Pauli condition.

So all options except D have L even → parity condition violated. So those are forbidden.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps options A, B, C are forbidden because L is even, violating parity. Option D is forbidden because Pauli condition isn't met.

But the question provides four options, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options are phrased as the initial state (1S0) → Final NN state + X's state.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the spin of the emitted particle. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's sufficient to focus on parity and Pauli condition.

Wait, another approach: the parity of the NN state must be (-1)^L. The parity of the X is -1. So overall parity after emission is (-1)^L * (-1). Which must equal the initial parity of 1.

So:

(-1)^L * (-1) = 1 → (-1)^{L+1} =1 → L+1 even → L odd.

So L must be odd.

So only option D has L=1.

But in option D, S=1, L=1 → S + L =2, which is even. So the Pauli condition (S+L ≡1 mod2) is not met. So this is invalid.

So the only option that satisfies the parity condition is D, but it fails the Pauli condition. So D is forbidden.

But the other options have L even, which violate the parity condition. So they are also forbidden.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is D, because it's the only one that passes the parity condition but fails the Pauli condition, making it impossible. All others fail the parity condition, making them impossible as well.

Wait, but the options say which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the answer is A, B, C, but the choices only list four options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the S in the Pauli condition is the spin of the NN system, not the emitted X.

So, the condition is T = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod2.

But the final NN state's S must be even. So S_NN must be even.

Looking at the options:

Option A: S=3 → invalid.

Option B: S=1 → invalid.

Option C:S=1 → invalid.

Option D:S=1 → invalid.

So all options have S=1 or 3, which are odd. So none satisfy the condition.

But that's impossible because the question must have an answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Maybe the condition is T = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod2.

Wait, the problem states: Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

So T = S + L +1 mod2.

With T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity.

In the final state, L must be odd (from parity conservation), so S must be even (because odd + even = odd → 1 mod2).

So, the final state must have S even and L odd.

Looking at the options:

Only option D has L=1 (odd), and S=1 (odd). So S is odd, which doesn't meet the condition.

So none of the options meet the condition.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the problem is about the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle, not the NN state.

Wait, the problem is about the partial wave of the emitted particle X. So the partial wave is characterized by l, the orbital angular momentum of X.

So the question is about the allowed l for X.

Wait, the options are structured as the initial state 1S0 → final NN state + X's state.

So the X's state is in a certain l state, like p, s, etc.

So the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l.

We need to find which l is not allowed.

So, considering the initial state has L=0, and the final NN state has L_NN.

The emitted X has l.

Conservation of orbital angular momentum: L_initial = L_NN + l.

But L_initial is 0 → L_NN + l =0 → L_NN = -l.

But since L and l are magnitudes, this implies L_NN = l.

So the orbital angular momentum of the NN system must equal that of the emitted X.

But earlier, from parity conservation, L_NN must be odd. So l must be odd.

So X must be emitted in an odd partial wave: l=1,3, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X is p → l=1 (allowed).

Option B: X is s → l=0 (even, not allowed).

Option C: X is f → l=3 (allowed).

Option D: X is s → l=0 (even, not allowed).

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought only option D had L_NN=1. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the problem is about the partial wave of X, so l must be odd. So any option where X's l is even is forbidden.

So options B and D have X in s state (l=0), which is even. So these are forbidden.

But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the options are the partial waves of X. So among the options, B and D have X in s state, which is l=0, even → forbidden.

But looking at the options:

Option B: X is s → l=0. So this is invalid.

Option D: X is s → l=0. Also invalid.

But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps both B and D are invalid, but looking back, the options don't list both. Wait, the options are:

A) p → allowed.

B) s → forbidden.

C) f → allowed.

D) s → forbidden.

So the forbidden partial waves are s.

But the options are four, each with different X states. The question is which one is not permitted.

So in the options, options B and D have s, which is forbidden.

But the initial question is which option is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is B or D.

Wait, but the problem states that the emitted X has intrinsic parity -1. Does this affect anything else?

Wait, X's parity is (-1)^l * intrinsic parity of X. X's intrinsic parity is given as -1. So the parity of X's state is (-1)^l * (-1).

But perhaps this isn't necessary for the current analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me try a different way.

The problem is about the partial wave of X, so the orbital angular momentum l.

From parity conservation, the parity of the NN state after emission must be (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) = P_initial =1.

So (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) =1 → (-1)^{L_NN +1} =1 → L_NN +1 even → L_NN odd.

So L_NN is odd.

From angular momentum conservation, L_initial =0 → L_NN + l =0 → L_NN = l.

So l must be odd.

Thus, the allowed l's are 1,3,5,... So the emitted X must be in an odd partial wave.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X in p (l=1) → allowed.

Option B: s (l=0) → forbidden.

Option C: f (l=3) → allowed.

Option D: s (l=0) → forbidden.

So the forbidden options are B and D.

But the options provided are four, and the question asks which is not permitted. So the answer would be either B or D.

But wait, the question provides four options. The correct answer is the one where the partial wave is not allowed, which is when X's l is even (s or any even l).

So among the options, options B and D have X in s state (l=0), which is even → forbidden.

But the options are:

A) p → allowed.

B) s → forbidden.

C) f → allowed.

D) s → forbidden.

So the problem is to choose which is not permitted. So the options B and D are invalid.

But the question gives four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

If the emitted particle's l must be odd, then options B and D have l=0 (even), which are forbidden.

But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden ones are B and D.

But the options are four, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But why would the question have two correct answers? No, there must be a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the spin of the emitted particle. For example, if X is a vector boson, its spin affects the total angular momentum. But without knowing the spin, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle, not its spin. So the parity condition is based on the orbital angular momentum.

In that case, X's parity is (-1)^l * intrinsic parity.

But since X's intrinsic parity is -1, the parity of X's state is (-1)^l * (-1).

So the overall parity after emission is (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l * (-1).

Wait, no, the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_NN}, and X's parity is (-1)^l * (-1). So the total parity is [(-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ].

But for parity conservation, the initial parity (1) must equal the final parity.

So:

1 = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l * (-1).

Simplify:

1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1}.

So (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} =1 → L_NN + l +1 must be even → L_NN + l is odd.

But from angular momentum conservation, L_NN = l → substitution gives l + l = 2l → which must be even (since 2l is even). So L_NN + l = 2l → even.

But from parity, L_NN + l must be odd. Contradiction.

Wait, that's a problem. So 2l must be both even and odd, which is impossible. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parity setup.

Wait, the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. The parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1) (since X has intrinsic parity -1).

So:

Final parity = (-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ].

Initial parity is 1.

So 1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1}.

Which implies (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} =1 → L_NN + l +1 must be even.

So L_NN + l must be odd.

But from angular momentum conservation, L_NN = l → substitution gives l + l = 2l → even.

So 2l must be odd → which is impossible because 2l is always even.

This suggests a contradiction. So perhaps the only way this works is if 2l is even and L_NN + l is even, but parity requires L_NN + l to be odd. So this can't happen. Therefore, there's no solution.

But that can't be, because the problem expects an answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1). Maybe the parity of X includes its spin state as well. But without knowing the spin, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the parity for now and focus on the Pauli condition and angular momentum.

But I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess. Since the only options with X in p or f are allowed in terms of parity, but we have to check the Pauli condition.

Wait, but earlier, the only option with L=1 is D, but it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, because it's the only one that satisfies parity conservation but fails the Pauli condition. So the partial wave not permitted is D.

Wait, but the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So if in option D, the Pauli condition isn't met, then that's not allowed. So the partial wave in D is not allowed.

But wait, in option D, X is in s state (l=0), which is even → parity condition not met. So option D would be forbidden for both reasons.

Wait, but earlier analysis said that for parity conservation, l must be odd. So any option with l even (like s) is forbidden.

So options B and D have X in s state (l=0 → even). So both are forbidden. But the problem gives four options, so perhaps the correct answer is D because it also has S=1, which violates the Pauli condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which option doesn't satisfy either parity or Pauli condition.

But I'm getting stuck and running out of time. I'll proceed to make a conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The goal is to determine which partial wave of the emitted particle X is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli condition: 

\[
T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2),
\]

where \(T(NN) = 0\). The parity of the NN system is given by \((-1)^{L_{NN}}\), and the parity of the final state must equal the initial parity (1). The parity of the emitted particle X is \((-1)^l \cdot (-1)\), where \(l\) is the orbital angular momentum of X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Parity Conservation**:  
   The initial parity is 1 (since \(L_{NN} = 0\)). After emission, the parity is given by:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{NN}} \cdot (-1)^l \cdot (-1) = 1.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{NN} + l + 1} = 1 \implies L_{NN} + l + 1 \text{ is even}.
   \]
   Since \(L_{NN} = l\) (from angular momentum conservation), this implies:
   \[
   l + l + 1 = 2l + 1 \text{ is even} \implies 2l \text{ is odd}.
   \]
   This is impossible because \(2l\) is always even. Thus, the parity condition requires \(l\) to be odd.

2. **Pauli Condition**:  
   The Pauli condition requires:
   \[
   T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \(T(NN) = 0\), this simplifies to:
   \[
   S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   For the final NN state, \(L_{NN} = l\) (from angular momentum conservation). Substituting, the condition becomes:
   \[
   S(NN) + l \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   Each option specifies the final NN state and the emitted particle X's partial wave \(l\). The NN state is denoted as \((2S+1)LJ\), where \(S\) is the total spin, \(L\) is the orbital angular momentum, and \(J\) is the total angular momentum.

   - **Option A**: \(1S0 \to 7D1 + p\)  
     - Final NN state: \(S = 3\), \(L = 2\).  
     - \(l = 1\) (p state, odd).  
     - Parity: \(L_{NN} = 2\) (even), \(l = 1\) (odd). Parity condition not satisfied.  
     - Pauli condition: \(S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Satisfied.  
     - **Forbidden due to parity violation**.

   - **Option B**: \(1S0 \to 3S1 + s\)  
     - Final NN state: \(S = 1\), \(L = 0\).  
     - \(l = 0\) (s state, even).  
     - Parity: \(L_{NN} = 0\) (even), \(l = 0\) (even). Parity condition not satisfied.  
     - Pauli condition: \(S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Satisfied.  
     - **Forbidden due to parity violation**.

   - **Option C**: \(1S0 \to 3D3 + f\)  
     - Final NN state: \(S = 1\), \(L = 2\).  
     - \(l = 3\) (f state, odd).  
     - Parity: \(L_{NN} = 2\) (even), \(l = 3\) (odd). Parity condition not satisfied.  
     - Pauli condition: \(S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Satisfied.  
     - **Forbidden due to parity violation**.

   - **Option D**: \(1S0 \to 3P0 + s\)  
     - Final NN state: \(S = 1\), \(L = 1\).  
     - \(l = 0\) (s state, even).  
     - Parity: \(L_{NN} = 1\) (odd), \(l = 0\) (even). Parity condition not satisfied.  
     - Pauli condition: \(S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Not satisfied.  
     - **Forbidden due to both parity and Pauli violations**.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave of the emitted particle X must be odd (\(l = 1, 3, \dots\)) to satisfy parity conservation. Options A, B, and C involve even \(l\) (s or f states), violating parity. Option D also violates parity and the Pauli condition. Among the options, **Option D** is the only one that fails both parity and Pauli conditions, making it the most forbidden.
