Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. 

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stochiometric probably means the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. 

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. K is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. 

I think the formula here involves the formation constant. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, how does that help me find [Ca²+] when I know the concentration of the complex? Let me set up the variables. Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let that be the initial concentration. Then, some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. 

Let’s denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA, the concentration of EDTA would also be x. So the reaction is at equilibrium, and Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x * x). Wait, wait. No, because the complex is 0.02 M initially, and if x is the amount that dissociates, then the complex concentration would be 0.02 - x. But wait, in reality, if the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA, and assuming they're both present in stoichiometric amounts, then perhaps the initial concentrations are such that [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are both 0.02 M before complexation. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the setup. 

Wait, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. So the dissociation would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. 

The K for dissociation would be 1/Kf, since Kf is the formation constant. Because Kf is formation, so Kd (dissociation) is 1/(Kf). So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would each be x. Since the dissociation is [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA^2−] = Kd. So (x)(x)/0.02 = Kd. 

So x^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11. Solving for x^2: x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root would be sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me check the options. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. That makes sense, because the K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so the free Ca²+ concentration is very low. 

But wait, wait another thing. Let me make sure I did the calculation right. Let me recompute x^2 is 0.02 * 2e-11. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Square root of that is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 = (2e-6.5)^2. Let me compute 2e-6.5. 10^-6 is 1e-6. 6.5 is between 6 and 7. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7, which rounds to about 6.3e-7. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium.

Let’s denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA, the concentration of EDTA would also be x.

No, because the complex is 0.02 M initially, and if x is the amount that dissociates, then the complex concentration would be 0.02 - x.

The K for dissociation would be 1/Kf, since Kf is the formation constant. Because Kf is formation, so Kd (dissociation) is 1/(Kf). So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would each be x. Since the dissociation is [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA^2−] = Kd. So (x)(x)/0.02 = Kd. 

So x^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11. Solving for x^2: x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root would be sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me check the options. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. That makes sense, because the K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so the free Ca²+ concentration is very low.

Wait, 4e-13 = (2e-6.5)^2. Let me compute 2e-6.5. 10^-6 is 1e-6. 6.5 is between 6 and 7. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7, which rounds to about 6.3e-7. So yes, option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
