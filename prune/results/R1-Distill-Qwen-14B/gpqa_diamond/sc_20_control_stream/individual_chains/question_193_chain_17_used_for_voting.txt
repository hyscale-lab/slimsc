Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that astronomers observed the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, considering per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Like, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax in arcseconds. So, distance r = 1 / plx. Oh wait, right, plx is the parallax. So if parallax increases, the distance decreases and vice versa.

So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we get N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that. 

1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as (r/1)^5, which is r^5. So, N is proportional to r^5. But wait, does that mean the number of stars increases with r^5?

Wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Wait, but the number of stars in the region depends on the volume, right? Because stars become less dense as you go further out, but the volume increases with distance. 

Wait, the actual number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the volume of the sphere with radius r. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But wait, in this case, the question is about how the number varies with distance, but the given relation is with parallax. So maybe I don't need to think about volume yet. 

Wait, the initial statement says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a constant. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that gives N = k * r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. Hmm, but wait, that seems really high. Because with distance, the number of stars in a given volume would decrease, but if we're looking at a region of fixed solid angle, the number might increase with r^3 because volume increases as r^3, but density decreases. But in this case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, so it's a different situation.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C * plx^-5, where C is a constant. Plx is 1/r, so substituting gives N = C * (1/r)^-5 = C * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars in that region increases with r^5.

But how does that make sense? Because if you look at a larger distance, the same solid angle would encompass a larger volume, so maybe more stars. But wait, the density of stars isn't uniform. Oh, wait, but the question doesn't state anything about density; it's just a relation given.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased is about how the number of stars in a region changes with distance. So, per unit range of distance r, like for each incremental increase in r, how does N change? 

So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with r is dN/dr = 5 * r^4. So the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the exact dependence. Let me think about the units to check.

Wait, parallax is in arcseconds, which is 1/r in parsecs. So, if N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. But the way the question is phrased is, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's the differential, the rate of change.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with distance would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be increasing as r^4. So the number in each slice of dr would be proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, I see options like r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Wait, the question is, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps the answer is that the number increases as r^5, but the options don't have that as a change. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars in a given volume (like per unit volume), but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I should model it mathematically. Let's say N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, N = k r^5, where k is the constant. So if r increases, N increases as the fifth power of r. So the number of stars in that region increases with r^5. So per unit range of distance, the number of stars would be increasing as r^4, but that's the rate of change. But the question asks how the number changes with distance, so the function is N ∝ r^5, which would mean that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because at larger distances, you're looking into a larger volume. But perhaps in this specific region, the number of stars is following this particular relation, so the model is different.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So, if parallax is inversely proportional to r, then N = k (1/plx)^5 = k r^5.

So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So, as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. So the number of stars in that region increases with r^5. 

But the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Wait, perhaps the question is about the derivative, like the change in number per unit change in r. So dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the rate at which the number increases is proportional to r^4. But the options don't have r^4 as an answer for the number's dependence. Wait, let me check the options.

The options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

Wait, the question is phrased as, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they're asking for the number per unit distance, meaning dN/dr.

In that case, if N = C r^5, then dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the options include option B as r^5 for the number. So perhaps the question is not about the derivative but the function of N with respect to r. So if N ~ r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5.

But the question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I'm a bit confused. Does it require the function N(r) or the derivative dN/dr?

Hmm, think about the wording. It says "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." So perhaps they're asking for how many stars are in each unit of r. So that would be the rate of change, dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4. So answer C.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, substitute:

N = k (r)^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region of the sky increases as r^5. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but the question is about how it changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps the question is about the function N(r), in which case it's r^5, option B. But if it's about the change per unit distance, then it would be r^4.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Ah, per unit range of distance. So "per unit r" — that sounds like the density, the number per unit distance. So that would be dN/dr.

So if N=kr^5, then dN/dr=5kr^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

So the answer would be option C, ~r^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought the question was about the number of stars in the region, which would be N=kr^5. So which is it? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should consider the original setup. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx is small (large distance), the number of stars is high. So for each unit of distance (say, each parsec), the number increases rapidly as you go further.

But that's only true if N is proportional to r^5, which would mean that as you look further, the number of stars you observe per unit volume goes up. But that's not the case in our universe, but the question is hypothetical.

So, given that N = kr^5, the number depends on r^5. So when you consider per unit distance (like how many more stars you see when you go one more parsec), that's the derivative.

So the change per unit distance is r^4, so the answer would be C.

But wait, the options are:

A) r^3

B) r^5

C) r^4

D) r^2

So the answer is C.

Wait, but I'm still a bit confused. Let me think in terms of variables.

Let me denote:

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

So, N is proportional to r^5.

But the question is asking: How does the number of stars change with distance, per unit distance? That is, the rate of change.

So, the rate of change is dN/dr = 5 r^4.

So the change per unit distance is ~r^4.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relation gives:

\[
N \propto r^5
\]

This means the number of stars in the region increases as the fifth power of distance. However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance **per unit range of distance** (\( r \)). This implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \).

Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Comparing this result to the options provided:

- **A) \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this describes the total number of stars, not the rate per unit distance.
- **C) \( r^4 \):** Correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
