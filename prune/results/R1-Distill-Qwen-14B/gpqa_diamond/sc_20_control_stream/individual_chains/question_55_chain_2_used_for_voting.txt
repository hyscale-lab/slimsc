Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is one of four possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm, so I need to interpret each of these signals and match them to the possible structures.

First, let's think about what each of these compounds looks like. Acetates are esters, so they have the structure R-OAc, where Ac is the acetate group.

Propenyl acetate would have a three-carbon propenyl group. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc or maybe CH2CH2CH2-OAc if it's something else. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or maybe CH2CH=CH-? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an substituent. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2OAc.

Wait, but the question includes both propenyl and butenyl. So butenyl would be a four-carbon group with a double bond. So butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or other isomer.

Wait, the options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Wait, but wait, butenyl is four carbons. So butenyl acetate would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? Or maybe CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Or perhaps it's a substituent with a double bond. Hmm, but butenyl can have different positions for the double bond.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's cis or trans. So let's think about each possible structure.

Wait, but let me focus on the NMR data. The signals are at 7.0 (d, J=16), 5.5 (dq), 2.1 (s), 1.6 (d).

So, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with coupling constant J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling, perhaps between two aromatic protons. But wait, the compound is an ester, so maybe it's not aromatic. Oh wait, maybe it's a vinyl proton. Because in alkenes, the protons can couple with each other. For example, in a trans double bond, the vicinal protons (on adjacent carbons) would have a coupling.

Wait, but in an ester like acetate, the structure would be R-O-CO-R'. So in the case of propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but wait, that's a three-carbon group, so the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In that structure, the protons on the CH2=CH- group would be adjacent. So the protons on the double bond (the vinyl protons) would show specific coupling.

But looking at the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a large J. That's a big coupling, which typically suggests a trans coupling, like in an aromatic ring but more likely in a trans double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trans coupling across a double bond.

Let me think: in a trans double bond, the two vinyl protons would be on opposite sides. So their coupling would be trans, leading to a large J value.

Wait, but wait, in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc? No, wait, no: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2- as a substituent on the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- and it's attached to the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, no. Wait, no, the substituent for propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the ester is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OAc? No, wait, no. Wait, acetate is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait, acetate is CH3COO-. So propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait, no. Wait, correct structure: the ester would be formed from the acid (like acetic acid) and the alcohol (like propenyl alcohol). So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but in that case, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the structure has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group.

So the protons on the double bond would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl chain, meaning the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, but then the protons on the double bond are on the CH2 group and the CH group.

Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the H on the first carbon (CH2) is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but the protons on the CH2 would be on the same side as the double bond.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, J=16 Hz, which is a large value, indicating coupling between two protons that are trans to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of the compound has a trans arrangement in the double bond.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about how the protons appear in the NMR.

In propenyl groups, the protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons) can show different splitting patterns based on their structure.

But maybe I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options.

The options are propenyl and butenyl. Let's see their structures.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-.

Butenyl group: which could be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH3CH2CH=CH- or other isomers.

Wait, but butenyl could also have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. But in propenyl, the double bond is between 1 and 2.

Wait, but in any case, let's think about the NMR signals.

The first signal is at 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a high chemical shift. For vinyl protons, shifts are usually around 5-6 ppm. Wait, that's higher than I expected. Maybe it's an aromatic ring, but in this case, the compound is an ester, so perhaps a substituted benzene? No, the question options don't include benzene rings. So maybe it's a conjugated system.

Wait, another possibility is that the proton is part of an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2OAc. Wait, but in that case, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be around 5.5-6.5 ppm.

Wait, but wait, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's quite a high shift. Maybe this is a coupling between two protons that are trans to each other in a double bond. So perhaps it's a trans coupling, so J is higher.

Another thought: in an ester with an allyl group, like CH2=CHCH2OAc, the vinyl protons would be around 5.5-6.5 ppm. But this signal is at 7.0, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group affecting the shift. Could this proton be adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen or carbonyl?

Let me think about the splitting. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so it's coupled to one other proton. The J is 16, which is a large coupling so maybe trans coupling.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the group is CH2=CHCH2OAc, the two protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be a triplet due to coupling with the CH2's protons. But no, in that case, the protons on the CH2 might split into a triplet. Or wait, maybe the CH2 is next to the double bond, and the protons on the double bond would split each other.

Wait, perhaps the structure is trans, so the double bond is in a trans configuration, leading to a larger J value.

Wait, but maybe I should look at the other signals. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, maybe that's a splitting from multiple coupling partners.

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet, 3H. That's likely the methyl group of the acetate (OAc), which is typically around 2 ppm as a singlet because the three protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Like in a structure where CH2 is connected to a double bond, such as CH2-CH2-CH2OAc. Wait, no, but if the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, then the CH2 next to the double bond would be split. Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 is a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3) or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted butenyl group. Let's consider butenyl acetate.

Butenyl can have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (cis or trans) or between 2 and 3 (cis or trans). So for example:

- Trans-2-pentene (butenyl group): CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the group is butenyl), but wait, butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (that's 1-pentene, but as a substituent, perhaps).

Wait, but the butenyl group would be -O-CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to think about the NMR.

Another approach: Let's consider the possible structures and their expected NMR signals.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are on the same side.

In this case, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond (the CH2 group) would be split by the double bond protons.

Wait, but the H on the double bond would be on the CH2 and the adjacent CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, making the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond.

In this structure, the two protons on the CH2 (CH2=CH-) are adjacent to the double bond, so they would couple with the protons on the CH group.

Wait, but in the NMR, each of these protons would be split by the other. So for the CH2 protons, each would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent CH proton.

Wait, but in the given data, the 7.0 and 5.5 regions are occupied by doublets. Let me think: maybe the proton at 7.0 is the CH proton, and the 5.5 is the CH2.

Wait, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is a triplet or a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the butenyl group has more carbons, leading to different splitting.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the integration. The 7.0 is 1H, 5.5 is 1H, 2.1 is 3H, and 1.6 is 3H. So that sums up to 6H for the NMR, but the molecule must have more H's. Wait, wait, no, the NMR is giving the integration for each group. So the molecule must have more protons, perhaps in a symmetrical position or as a singlet.

Wait, maybe the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests it's coupled to two different sets of protons. Let me think: if the H at 5.5 is coupled to two different protons, each with a different J value, perhaps from adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the H's is part of a trans double bond, leading to a larger J. The other H may be part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH group which is adjacent to the double bond.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the CH2 group is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, to clarify: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, acetate is CH3COO-. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O- attached to the carbonyl.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH2 and the CH.

Wait, but the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton (since the double bond is between C1 and C2).

Wait, no, wait, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the protons on the CH2 (C1) would be two H's, and the protons on the CH (C2) would be one H.

Wait, but that would mean the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2. So the H on C2 would couple with the two H's on C1.

Wait, so the H on C2 would be a triplet, because it's coupled to two equivalent protons on C1.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C1's CH2 is a doublet, as they are coupled to the H on C2.

Wait, but each H on C1 would be coupled to the single H on C2, leading to a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to the two H's on C1 (CH2), so each of those would split into a doublet. But wait, each H on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on CH, so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since they are equivalent, their splitting would be a doublet for the CH2 group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the NMR signals in this structure.

CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The H's on CH2 (C1) would be next to the H on C2 (CH). Each H on C1 would be coupled to the H on C2. So each of the two H's on C1 would be split into a doublet. Since the two H's on C1 are equivalent, their combined signal would be a doublet. The chemical shift for these H's would be around 5.5 ppm (since they are adjacent to a double bond).

The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to the two H's on C1, so it would be a triplet. But the chemical shift for this H would be around 6.5 ppm, perhaps.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, and 5.5 is a doublet. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, which has four carbons. Let's consider butenyl acetate.

For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But wait, that would be pentenyl acetate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the nomenclature.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but that's butyl acetate, which doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, but the question is about butenyl acetate, which has a double bond. So butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which is 1-pentene? No, wait, the butenyl group is four carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, making it a four-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but then the substituent would be four carbons, so it's a butenyl group.

In that case, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try a different approach.

The NMR data shows two doublets: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). The 2.1 ppm is a singlet (3H), which is likely the OAc methyl group. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which could be a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group that's next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-OAc. But that would be a butenyl group with a substituent.

Wait, but if the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), that suggests the methyl group is attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond. So, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2CH-OAc with a double bond. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, leading to specific coupling patterns.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling. In a trans configuration, the coupling is larger, so this J suggests trans coupling between two vinylic protons.

Wait, but in propenyl groups, each H would be adjacent to another H on the same CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group where the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it a 2-butenyl group. For example, CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. But wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-pentene), but that's a five-carbon group, which isn't matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options and their structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The H's on the CH2 (C1) would be adjacent to the H on C2. So each H on C1 would be a doublet, and the H on C2 would be a triplet, because it's coupled to two H's.

So in the NMR, the CH2 group would appear as a doublet around 5.5 ppm, and the CH would appear as a triplet around 6.5 ppm. But in the data, the 7.0 is a doublet and 5.5 is a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but propenyl groups can't be trans, because in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are on either side. But propenyl groups are either cis or trans? Wait, no, propenyl is a three-carbon group with a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The substituents on either side of the double bond would be a CH2OAc group and a H.

Wait, but propenyl groups don't have substituents on both sides unless it's a substituted propenyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the butenyl group is the one with substituents on both sides of the double bond, allowing for cis or trans configurations.

Wait, but the question includes options for both propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans.

Assuming that the butenyl group has a double bond that allows for cis and trans isomerism.

So, for example, the butenyl group could be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, which would have a double bond between C2 and C3. In this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be CH2 groups, allowing for cis and trans configurations.

In the trans case, the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

In the cis case, the two CH2 groups are on the same side.

In that structure, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have specific coupling patterns.

Wait, but how would the NMR look for that structure?

Each of the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have two H's that are split by the H's on the adjacent carbons.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, leading to a larger coupling constant J.

So, the 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) could be the H on C2 (CH) of a trans double bond, which is coupled to another H on C3 (CH), leading to a doublet.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling would be between H's on adjacent carbons across the double bond. So for a double bond like CH2-CH2, the coupling would be longer-range, perhaps a vicinal coupling. But that usually gives smaller J values, like around 6-8 Hz. However, in some cases, like in conjugated systems, the J can be larger.

Wait, but a J of 16 Hz is quite large, which suggests a trans coupling across a double bond. So perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, like in 2-pentene.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, but in cis configuration. So the two CH2 groups are on the same side of the double bond.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Same structure but trans.

In this structure, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which might correspond to a H that's coupled to another H across the double bond. So for example, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to the H on C3 (CH2), but that would require a J value. Alternatively, perhaps it's the H on C3 that's coupled to the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps in the trans configuration, the H's on C2 and C3 are on opposite sides, leading to a larger J value.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a geminal coupling, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps it's better to focus on the number of signals and their splitting.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), and the 5.5 is a doublet (1H). So perhaps these are the two H's that are part of the double bond.

Wait, but a double bond typically has two H's if it's a simple structure. Unless it's a substituted double bond with only one H per carbon, like in an allyl group.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, then the middle CH would have one H, and the adjacent CH2 would have two H's.

Wait, but in that case, the H on the CH would be coupled to the two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an isopropyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the doublet at 7.0 with J=16 Hz suggests that this proton is coupled to only one other proton, and that coupling is trans.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but with a substituent on the other side.

Wait, but that's propenyl again.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2OAc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, which suggests that the three H's are on a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In this case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have H's that are split.

The CH2=CH-CH2CH2-OAc.

The H's on the CH2 next to the double bond (i.e., CH2=CH-) would be split by the H's on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but in this case, the H's on the CH2 would be a doublet, and the H on the CH would be a triplet or something else.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet, which could correspond to the H on the CH, which is coupled to the two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet, but that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the integration.

The NMR shows:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.

-5.5 ppm: 1H, dq.

-2.1 ppm: 3H, s (OAc methyl).

-1.6 ppm: 3H, d.

So, total of 6 H's? Or perhaps I'm missing some. Wait, no, the acetate group has 3 H's (the OAc methyl), the propenyl or butenyl would have more H's. So perhaps I'm not considering all the H's, but perhaps some are equivalent and not showing up as separate signals.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3), but that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the doublet at 5.5 is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests coupling with two different groups. For example, it could be a CH that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with 2 H's, leading to a doublet of quartets.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate. Let me think about that.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this structure, the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

The H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would each be split due to coupling with the H's on the double bond.

Wait, but the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the CH2 groups are on C1 and C4.

So the H's on C1 (CH2) would couple with the H's on C2 (CH), and the H's on C4 (CH2) would couple with the H's on C3 (CH).

Wait, but in that case, each H on C1 would be a doublet due to coupling with the H on C2.

Similarly, each H on C4 would be a doublet due to coupling with the H on C3.

The H's on C2 and C3 would each be a triplet because they're coupled to two H's on adjacent CH2 groups.

But in the given NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet (1H), and the 5.5 is a doublet (1H). So perhaps the H's on C2 and C3 are each a triplet, but in the data, they don't show up as such. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting patterns again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests it's coupled to one other proton. So perhaps it's a proton that's only coupled to one other proton. That could happen if it's a terminal double bond.

Wait, like in CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. In this structure, the H on the CH2 next to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be a doublet, as each H is coupled to the H on CH.

But wait, the H on CH is only one, so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, and the H on CH would be a triplet.

So in that case, the CH2 group would appear as a doublet around 5.5 ppm, and the CH would appear as a triplet around 6.5 ppm.

But in the given NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet and 5.5 is a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents are on opposite sides, making it a trans configuration.

Wait, but in propenyl, the substituents are CH2-OAc and H. So it can't have a trans configuration because there's only one substituent on each side.

Ah, that's a good point. So, the propenyl group can't have a trans configuration because the substituents on either side of the double bond are different (one is CH2-OAc, the other is H). So the propenyl group can only exist as a cis or trans based on the substituents, but since it's a terminal double bond, it can't be trans. Wait, but actually, for a double bond with two different substituents, like CH2-OAc and H, the double bond can be either cis or trans.

Wait, but in reality, for a double bond with two different substituents on each carbon, you can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans). So propenyl can have cis and trans isomers.

So, for example, in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the substituents on the double bond are CH2-OAc and H. So, the H and the CH2-OAc group can be on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

In the trans case, the H and the CH2-OAc would be on opposite sides. But in the NMR, this would affect the coupling constants.

In a trans configuration, the coupling J would be larger because the protons are on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling constant, which would match the J=16 Hz in the given data.

So, if the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, then the H on the CH would be trans to the CH2-OAc group.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think: in a trans configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So, the H on C2 (CH) would be opposite to the CH2-OAc on C1.

In this case, the H on C2 would be trans to the CH2-OAc group. So, the coupling between the H on C2 and the H's on C1 would be a trans coupling, leading to a larger J value.

In the NMR, the H on C2 would be a doublet, coupled to the two H's on C1, but because it's trans, the J would be larger, say around 16 Hz.

Wait, but in the given data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which would correspond to this H on C2 being coupled to the H's on C1.

But wait, the H's on C1 are two H's, so the H on C2 would be a triplet, not a doublet. Because each H on C2 is coupled to two equivalent H's on C1.

Wait, but the splitting would lead to a triplet for the H on C2. But the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again: if the H on C2 is coupled to two H's on C1, it would split into a triplet. But the data shows a doublet. So that suggests the H on C2 is only coupled to one H, which would be the case if the two H's on C1 are equivalent and the coupling is to a single H elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the coupling of the H on C2 to the H's on C1 and any other couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to another H that's further away, such as on C3, leading to a different J.

Wait, but propenyl groups don't have a C3, so that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group with a trans double bond, leading to the H on C3 being coupled to the H on C4, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's consider each option and predict the NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, cis configuration.

In this case, the H on C2 (CH) is on the same side as the CH2-OAc group.

The H's on C1 (CH2) would be a doublet (coupled to the H on C2), and the H on C2 would be a triplet (coupled to the two H's on C1 and any others).

But in the data, the 7.0 is a doublet, suggesting that the H is coupled to only one H with a large J. So maybe in the cis configuration, the H on C2 is coupled to the H on C3 (if any), but in propenyl, there's no C3.

So maybe this doesn't fit.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the H on C2 is trans to the CH2-OAc group.

The H on C2 would be coupled to the two H's on C1, leading to a triplet. But in the data, it's a doublet, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, but the data's 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests only one coupling partner. So perhaps it's not a propenyl group.

Let me consider the butenyl groups.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, cis configuration.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on each side are CH2 groups.

In the cis configuration, the two CH2 groups are on the same side.

The H's on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond, and their H's would be coupled to the H's on C3.

Similarly, the H's on C3 would be coupled to the H's on C2.

In this structure, the H's on C2 and C3 would each couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, each of these H's would be a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But the data shows a doublet at 7.0 and another at 5.5.

Hmm.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides.

The H's on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides of the double bond.

Each H on C2 would be coupled to the two H's on C3, leading to a triplet.

Similarly, each H on C3 would be coupled to the two H's on C2, leading to a triplet.

So in the NMR, the C2 and C3 H's would appear as triplets around 5.5-6.5 ppm.

But the given data has 7.0 as a doublet and 5.5 as a doublet.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the H's is on a CH2 adjacent to the double bond, and it's coupled to another H on a CH group across the double bond.

So, for example, the H on C2 (CH2) is coupled to the H on C3 (CH), leading to a doublet with J=16 Hz.

In that case, the 7.0 ppm would be the H on C3, which is a doublet due to coupling with the H on C2.

The 5.5 ppm would be the H on C2, which is a doublet due to coupling with the H on C3.

Wait, but that would require the H's on C2 and C3 to be each a doublet, which fits the data.

In this scenario, the 7.0 ppm is the H on C3 (CH), and the 5.5 is the H on C2 (CH2), but wait, the H on C2 is a CH2, which has two H's, so their signal would be a doublet due to coupling with the single H on C3.

So the CH2 group would show as a doublet at around 5.5 ppm, and the H on C3 would show as a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

That fits the data.

Now, considering the configuration (cis or trans), the coupling constant J would be larger in the trans configuration. So if the substituents are trans, the J would be around 16 Hz, which matches the data.

So, if the structure is trans-butenyl acetate, the H on C3 would be trans to the H on C2, leading to a larger J.

Wait, but wait, in the trans configuration, the substituents on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides. So the H on C3 would be on the opposite side of the double bond from the H on C2.

Wait, but in this case, the H on C2 is part of a CH2 group, so perhaps it's not directly across from the H on C3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents. Let me think again.

In trans-butenyl acetate (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc), the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the CH2 groups are across from each other. So the H's on the CH2 groups (C2 and C3) would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling J.

So, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to the H on C3 (CH2), but wait, each CH2 has two H's. So the H's on C2 would be coupled to the two H's on C3, leading to a triplet.

But the given data has a doublet for 5.5 ppm. So perhaps this isn't right.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Perhaps the substituent is such that one of the H's is on a CH group, and the other is on a CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would introduce a methyl branch, which is indicated in the NMR with a doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Wait, the NMR has a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) group would have a methyl group attached, leading to the 1.6 ppm signal.

In that case, the H on the CH(CH2CH3) would be a doublet due to coupling with the H's on the adjacent CH2 group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2OAc. Then, the H on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be coupled to the H on the double bond, leading to specific splitting.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which is a methyl group. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc, but that would require a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, and the 1.6 ppm is the terminal CH2 group. But then why would it be a doublet?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, and the H's on the terminal CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2, leading to a doublet.

But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to match the J value of 16 Hz with a trans configuration.

So, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons. Therefore, the structure must have a trans double bond.

Which options have a trans double bond? Options B and D.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

But as discussed earlier, propenyl groups with a trans configuration may not show the correct splitting in the NMR.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

In this structure, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides, leading to a larger J.

So, the H's on C2 and C3 would have a larger J, around 16 Hz, which fits the 7.0 ppm signal.

So, the H's on C2 and C3 would each be a doublet, but wait, the CH2 groups would have two H's each, so their signals would be doublets.

Wait, but the given data has only one H each, which suggests that perhaps the structure is such that only one H is present on each of those carbons.

Ah, no, because in butenyl groups, each CH2 group has two H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the butenyl group with a trans double bond would have two CH2 groups on either side of the double bond.

So, the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the H's on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond and coupled to the H's on C3 (CH2). Each H on C2 would be a doublet, and each H on C3 would be a doublet.

But in the NMR, only one H is observed for each, which suggests that perhaps the substituent is such that each CH has only one H.

Wait, no, that can't be. Each CH2 has two H's.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is such that the H's on C2 and C3 are each a doublet due to coupling with each other across the double bond.

Wait, but that would require a long-range coupling, which is possible in some cases, like allylic coupling, but that usually has smaller J values.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to diastereotopic protons.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to make a decision.

The J=16 Hz at 7.0 suggests a trans coupling, which is more likely in a trans double bond.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 next to a double bond.

Putting it all together, the structure is likely Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D), as it has a trans double bond leading to a large J value, and the methyl group would fit the 1.6 ppm signal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

1H NMR (ppm):  
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)  
- 5.5 (1H, dq)  
- 2.1 (3H, s)  
- 1.6 (3H, d)  

### Key Analysis:
1. **Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**:
   - The **7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a proton coupled to one other proton with a large coupling constant, characteristic of a trans coupling across a double bond.
   - The **5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (1H)** suggests a proton coupled to two non-equivalent protons, likely due to its position near a double bond.
   - The **2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) functional group.
   - The **1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** indicates a methyl group attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

2. **Structural Considerations**:
   - **Propenyl acetate** (CH2=CHCH2-OAc) has a terminal double bond. The protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond would typically appear as a doublet around 5.5 ppm, and the proton on the CH group would appear as a triplet around 6.5 ppm. However, the given data does not match this pattern, as the 7.0 ppm signal suggests a larger coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), which is more consistent with a trans double bond.

   - **Butenyl acetate** (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc) has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, allowing for cis and trans configurations. In the **trans configuration**, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the protons on C2 and C3. This matches the 7.0 ppm doublet. The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets corresponds to the protons on C2 or C3, which are coupled to two non-equivalent protons. The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to the methyl group on the terminal CH2.

3. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **Cis-propenyl acetate** and **Trans-propenyl acetate**: These cannot explain the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) observed at 7.0 ppm, as propenyl groups lack sufficient substituents on both sides of the double bond to exhibit such a large J.
   - **Cis-butenyl acetate**: In the cis configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side, resulting in a smaller coupling constant (J < 16 Hz). This does not match the data.
   - **Trans-butenyl acetate**: This structure has a trans double bond, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the protons on C2 and C3. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts in the NMR data align with this structure.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it explains the large coupling constant, the splitting patterns, and the chemical shifts.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is one of four possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm, so I need to interpret each of these signals and match them to the possible structures.

First, let's think about what each of these compounds looks like. Acetates are esters, so they have the structure R-OAc, where Ac is the acetate group.

Propenyl acetate would have a three-carbon propenyl group. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc or maybe CH2CH2CH2-OAc if it's something else. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or maybe CH2CH=CH-? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an substituent. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2OAc.

Wait, but the question includes both propenyl and butenyl. So butenyl would be a four-carbon group with a double bond. So butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or other isomer.

Wait, the options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Wait, but wait, butenyl is four carbons. So butenyl acetate would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? Or maybe CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Or perhaps it's a substituent with a double bond. Hmm, but butenyl can have different positions for the double bond.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's cis or trans. So let's think about each possible structure.

Wait, but let me focus on the NMR data. The signals are at 7.0 (d, J=16), 5.5 (dq), 2.1 (s), 1.6 (d).

So, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with coupling constant J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling, perhaps between two aromatic protons. But wait, the compound is an ester, so maybe it's not aromatic. Oh wait, maybe it's a vinyl proton. Because in alkenes, the protons can couple with each other. For example, in a trans double bond, the vicinal protons (on adjacent carbons) would have a coupling.

Wait, but in an ester like acetate, the structure would be R-O-CO-R'. So in the case of propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but wait, that's a three-carbon group, so the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In that structure, the protons on the CH2=CH- group would be adjacent. So the protons on the double bond (the vinyl protons) would show specific coupling.

But looking at the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a large J. That's a big coupling, which typically suggests a trans coupling, like in an aromatic ring but more likely in a trans double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trans coupling across a double bond.

Let me think: in a trans double bond, the two vinyl protons would be on opposite sides. So their coupling would be trans, leading to a large J value.

Wait, but wait, in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc? No, wait, no: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2- as a substituent on the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- and it's attached to the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, no. Wait, no, the substituent for propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the ester is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OAc? No, wait, no. Wait, acetate is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait, acetate is CH3COO-. So propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait, no. Wait, correct structure: the ester would be formed from the acid (like acetic acid) and the alcohol (like propenyl alcohol). So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but in that case, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the structure has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group.

So the protons on the double bond would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl chain, meaning the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, but then the protons on the double bond are on the CH2 group and the CH group.

Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the H on the first carbon (CH2) is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but the protons on the CH2 would be on the same side as the double bond.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, J=16 Hz, which is a large value, indicating coupling between two protons that are trans to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of the compound has a trans arrangement in the double bond.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about how the protons appear in the NMR.

In propenyl groups, the protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons) can show different splitting patterns based on their structure.

But maybe I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options.

The options are propenyl and butenyl. Let's see their structures.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-.

Butenyl group: which could be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH3CH2CH=CH- or other isomers.

Wait, but butenyl could also have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. But in propenyl, the double bond is between 1 and 2.

Wait, but in any case, let's think about the NMR signals.

The first signal is at 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a high chemical shift. For vinyl protons, shifts are usually around 5-6 ppm. Wait, that's higher than I expected. Maybe it's an aromatic ring, but in this case, the compound is an ester, so perhaps a substituted benzene? No, the question options don't include benzene rings. So maybe it's a conjugated system.

Wait, another possibility is that the proton is part of an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2OAc. Wait, but in that case, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be around 5.5-6.5 ppm.

Wait, but wait, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's quite a high shift. Maybe this is a coupling between two protons that are trans to each other in a double bond. So perhaps it's a trans coupling, so J is higher.

Another thought: in an ester with an allyl group, like CH2=CHCH2OAc, the vinyl protons would be around 5.5-6.5 ppm. But this signal is at 7.0, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group affecting the shift. Could this proton be adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen or carbonyl?

Let me think about the splitting. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so it's coupled to one other proton. The J is 16, which is a large coupling so maybe trans coupling.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the group is CH2=CHCH2OAc, the two protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be a triplet due to coupling with the CH2's protons. But no, in that case, the protons on the CH2 might split into a triplet. Or wait, maybe the CH2 is next to the double bond, and the protons on the double bond would split each other.

Wait, perhaps the structure is trans, so the double bond is in a trans configuration, leading to a larger J value.

Wait, but maybe I should look at the other signals. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, maybe that's a splitting from multiple coupling partners.

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet, 3H. That's likely the methyl group of the acetate (OAc), which is typically around 2 ppm as a singlet because the three protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Like in a structure where CH2 is connected to a double bond, such as CH2-CH2-CH2OAc. Wait, no, but if the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, then the CH2 next to the double bond would be split. Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 is a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3) or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted butenyl group. Let's consider butenyl acetate.

Butenyl can have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (cis or trans) or between 2 and 3 (cis or trans). So for example:

- Trans-2-pentene (butenyl group): CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the group is butenyl), but wait, butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (that's 1-pentene, but as a substituent, perhaps).

Wait, but the butenyl group would be -O-CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to think about the NMR.

Another approach: Let's consider the possible structures and their expected NMR signals.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are on the same side.

In this case, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond (the CH2 group) would be split by the double bond protons.

Wait, but the H on the double bond would be on the CH2 and the adjacent CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, making the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond.

In this structure, the two protons on the CH2 (CH2=CH-) are adjacent to the double bond, so they would couple with the protons on the CH group.

Wait, but in the NMR, each of these protons would be split by the other. So for the CH2 protons, each would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent CH proton.

Wait, but in the given data, the 7.0 and 5.5 regions are occupied by doublets. Let me think: maybe the proton at 7.0 is the CH proton, and the 5.5 is the CH2.

Wait, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is a triplet or a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the butenyl group has more carbons, leading to different splitting.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the integration. The 7.0 is 1H, 5.5 is 1H, 2.1 is 3H, and 1.6 is 3H. So that sums up to 6H for the NMR, but the molecule must have more H's. Wait, wait, no, the NMR is giving the integration for each group. So the molecule must have more protons, perhaps in a symmetrical position or as a singlet.

Wait, maybe the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests it's coupled to two different sets of protons. Let me think: if the H at 5.5 is coupled to two different protons, each with a different J value, perhaps from adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the H's is part of a trans double bond, leading to a larger J. The other H may be part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH group which is adjacent to the double bond.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the CH2 group is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, to clarify: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, acetate is CH3COO-. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O- attached to the carbonyl.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH2 and the CH.

Wait, but the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton (since the double bond is between C1 and C2).

Wait, no, wait, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the protons on the CH2 (C1) would be two H's, and the protons on the CH (C2) would be one H.

Wait, but that would mean the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2. So the H on C2 would couple with the two H's on C1.

Wait, so the H on C2 would be a triplet, because it's coupled to two equivalent protons on C1.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C1's CH2 is a doublet, as they are coupled to the H on C2.

Wait, but each H on C1 would be coupled to the single H on C2, leading to a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to the two H's on C1 (CH2), so each of those would split into a doublet. But wait, each H on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on CH, so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since they are equivalent, their splitting would be a doublet for the CH2 group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the NMR signals in this structure.

CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The H's on CH2 (C1) would be next to the H on C2 (CH). Each H on C1 would be coupled to the H on C2. So each of the two H's on C1 would be split into a doublet. Since the two H's on C1 are equivalent, their combined signal would be a doublet. The chemical shift for these H's would be around 5.5 ppm (since they are adjacent to a double bond).

The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to the two H's on C1, so it would be a triplet. But the chemical shift for this H would be around 6.5 ppm, perhaps.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, and 5.5 is a doublet. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, which has four carbons. Let's consider butenyl acetate.

For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But wait, that would be pentenyl acetate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the nomenclature.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but that's butyl acetate, which doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, but the question is about butenyl acetate, which has a double bond. So butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which is 1-pentene? No, wait, the butenyl group is four carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, making it a four-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but then the substituent would be four carbons, so it's a butenyl group.

In that case, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try a different approach.

The NMR data shows two doublets: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). The 2.1 ppm is a singlet (3H), which is likely the OAc methyl group. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which could be a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group that's next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-OAc. But that would be a butenyl group with a substituent.

Wait, but if the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), that suggests the methyl group is attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond. So, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2CH-OAc with a double bond. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, leading to specific coupling patterns.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling. In a trans configuration, the coupling is larger, so this J suggests trans coupling between two vinylic protons.

Wait, but in propenyl groups, each H would be adjacent to another H on the same CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group where the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it a 2-butenyl group. For example, CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. But wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-pentene), but that's a five-carbon group, which isn't matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options and their structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The H's on the CH2 (C1) would be adjacent to the H on C2. So each H on C1 would be a doublet, and the H on C2 would be a triplet, because it's coupled to two H's.

So in the NMR, the CH2 group would appear as a doublet around 5.5 ppm, and the CH would appear as a triplet around 6.5 ppm. But in the data, the 7.0 is a doublet and 5.5 is a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but propenyl groups can't be trans, because in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are on either side. But propenyl groups are either cis or trans? Wait, no, propenyl is a three-carbon group with a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The substituents on either side of the double bond would be a CH2OAc group and a H.

Wait, but propenyl groups don't have substituents on both sides unless it's a substituted propenyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the butenyl group is the one with substituents on both sides of the double bond, allowing for cis or trans configurations.

Wait, but the question includes options for both propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans.

Assuming that the butenyl group has a double bond that allows for cis and trans isomerism.

So, for example, the butenyl group could be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, which would have a double bond between C2 and C3. In this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be CH2 groups, allowing for cis and trans configurations.

In the trans case, the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

In the cis case, the two CH2 groups are on the same side.

In that structure, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have specific coupling patterns.

Wait, but how would the NMR look for that structure?

Each of the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have two H's that are split by the H's on the adjacent carbons.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, leading to a larger coupling constant J.

So, the 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) could be the H on C2 (CH) of a trans double bond, which is coupled to another H on C3 (CH), leading to a doublet.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling would be between H's on adjacent carbons across the double bond. So for a double bond like CH2-CH2, the coupling would be longer-range, perhaps a vicinal coupling. But that usually gives smaller J values, like around 6-8 Hz. However, in some cases, like in conjugated systems, the J can be larger.

Wait, but a J of 16 Hz is quite large, which suggests a trans coupling across a double bond. So perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, like in 2-pentene.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, but in cis configuration. So the two CH2 groups are on the same side of the double bond.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Same structure but trans.

In this structure, the H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which might correspond to a H that's coupled to another H across the double bond. So for example, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to the H on C3 (CH2), but that would require a J value. Alternatively, perhaps it's the H on C3 that's coupled to the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps in the trans configuration, the H's on C2 and C3 are on opposite sides, leading to a larger J value.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a geminal coupling, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps it's better to focus on the number of signals and their splitting.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), and the 5.5 is a doublet (1H). So perhaps these are the two H's that are part of the double bond.

Wait, but a double bond typically has two H's if it's a simple structure. Unless it's a substituted double bond with only one H per carbon, like in an allyl group.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, then the middle CH would have one H, and the adjacent CH2 would have two H's.

Wait, but in that case, the H on the CH would be coupled to the two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an isopropyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the doublet at 7.0 with J=16 Hz suggests that this proton is coupled to only one other proton, and that coupling is trans.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but with a substituent on the other side.

Wait, but that's propenyl again.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2OAc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, which suggests that the three H's are on a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In this case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have H's that are split.

The CH2=CH-CH2CH2-OAc.

The H's on the CH2 next to the double bond (i.e., CH2=CH-) would be split by the H's on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but in this case, the H's on the CH2 would be a doublet, and the H on the CH would be a triplet or something else.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet, which could correspond to the H on the CH, which is coupled to the two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet, but that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the integration.

The NMR shows:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.

-5.5 ppm: 1H, dq.

-2.1 ppm: 3H, s (OAc methyl).

-1.6 ppm: 3H, d.

So, total of 6 H's? Or perhaps I'm missing some. Wait, no, the acetate group has 3 H's (the OAc methyl), the propenyl or butenyl would have more H's. So perhaps I'm not considering all the H's, but perhaps some are equivalent and not showing up as separate signals.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3), but that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the doublet at 5.5 is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests coupling with two different groups. For example, it could be a CH that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with 2 H's, leading to a doublet of quartets.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate. Let me think about that.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this structure, the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

The H's on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would each be split due to coupling with the H's on the double bond.

Wait, but the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the CH2 groups are on C1 and C4.

So the H's on C1 (CH2) would couple with the H's on C2 (CH), and the H's on C4 (CH2) would couple with the H's on C3 (CH).

Wait, but in that case, each H on C1 would be a doublet due to coupling with the H on C2.

Similarly, each H on C4 would be a doublet due to coupling with the H on C3.

The H's on C2 and C3 would each be a triplet because they're coupled to two H's on adjacent CH2 groups.

But in the given NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet (1H), and the 5.5 is a doublet (1H). So perhaps the H's on C2 and C3 are each a triplet, but in the data, they don't show up as such. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting patterns again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests it's coupled to one other proton. So perhaps it's a proton that's only coupled to one other proton. That could happen if it's a terminal double bond.

Wait, like in CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. In this structure, the H on the CH2 next to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be a doublet, as each H is coupled to the H on CH.

But wait, the H on CH is only one, so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, and the H on CH would be a triplet.

So in that case, the CH2 group would appear as a doublet around 5.5 ppm, and the CH would appear as a triplet around 6.5 ppm.

But in the given NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet and 5.5 is a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents are on opposite sides, making it a trans configuration.

Wait, but in propenyl, the substituents are CH2-OAc and H. So it can't have a trans configuration because there's only one substituent on each side.

Ah, that's a good point. So, the propenyl group can't have a trans configuration because the substituents on either side of the double bond are different (one is CH2-OAc, the other is H). So the propenyl group can only exist as a cis or trans based on the substituents, but since it's a terminal double bond, it can't be trans. Wait, but actually, for a double bond with two different substituents, like CH2-OAc and H, the double bond can be either cis or trans.

Wait, but in reality, for a double bond with two different substituents on each carbon, you can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans). So propenyl can have cis and trans isomers.

So, for example, in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the substituents on the double bond are CH2-OAc and H. So, the H and the CH2-OAc group can be on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

In the trans case, the H and the CH2-OAc would be on opposite sides. But in the NMR, this would affect the coupling constants.

In a trans configuration, the coupling J would be larger because the protons are on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling constant, which would match the J=16 Hz in the given data.

So, if the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, then the H on the CH would be trans to the CH2-OAc group.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think: in a trans configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So, the H on C2 (CH) would be opposite to the CH2-OAc on C1.

In this case, the H on C2 would be trans to the CH2-OAc group. So, the coupling between the H on C2 and the H's on C1 would be a trans coupling, leading to a larger J value.

In the NMR, the H on C2 would be a doublet, coupled to the two H's on C1, but because it's trans, the J would be larger, say around 16 Hz.

Wait, but in the given data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which would correspond to this H on C2 being coupled to the H's on C1.

But wait, the H's on C1 are two H's, so the H on C2 would be a triplet, not a doublet. Because each H on C2 is coupled to two equivalent H's on C1.

Wait, but the splitting would lead to a triplet for the H on C2. But the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again: if the H on C2 is coupled to two H's on C1, it would split into a triplet. But the data shows a doublet. So that suggests the H on C2 is only coupled to one H, which would be the case if the two H's on C1 are equivalent and the coupling is to a single H elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the coupling of the H on C2 to the H's on C1 and any other couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to another H that's further away, such as on C3, leading to a different J.

Wait, but propenyl groups don't have a C3, so that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group with a trans double bond, leading to the H on C3 being coupled to the H on C4, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's consider each option and predict the NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, cis configuration.

In this case, the H on C2 (CH) is on the same side as the CH2-OAc group.

The H's on C1 (CH2) would be a doublet (coupled to the H on C2), and the H on C2 would be a triplet (coupled to the two H's on C1 and any others).

But in the data, the 7.0 is a doublet, suggesting that the H is coupled to only one H with a large J. So maybe in the cis configuration, the H on C2 is coupled to the H on C3 (if any), but in propenyl, there's no C3.

So maybe this doesn't fit.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the H on C2 is trans to the CH2-OAc group.

The H on C2 would be coupled to the two H's on C1, leading to a triplet. But in the data, it's a doublet, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, but the data's 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests only one coupling partner. So perhaps it's not a propenyl group.

Let me consider the butenyl groups.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, cis configuration.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on each side are CH2 groups.

In the cis configuration, the two CH2 groups are on the same side.

The H's on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond, and their H's would be coupled to the H's on C3.

Similarly, the H's on C3 would be coupled to the H's on C2.

In this structure, the H's on C2 and C3 would each couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, each of these H's would be a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But the data shows a doublet at 7.0 and another at 5.5.

Hmm.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides.

The H's on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides of the double bond.

Each H on C2 would be coupled to the two H's on C3, leading to a triplet.

Similarly, each H on C3 would be coupled to the two H's on C2, leading to a triplet.

So in the NMR, the C2 and C3 H's would appear as triplets around 5.5-6.5 ppm.

But the given data has 7.0 as a doublet and 5.5 as a doublet.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the H's is on a CH2 adjacent to the double bond, and it's coupled to another H on a CH group across the double bond.

So, for example, the H on C2 (CH2) is coupled to the H on C3 (CH), leading to a doublet with J=16 Hz.

In that case, the 7.0 ppm would be the H on C3, which is a doublet due to coupling with the H on C2.

The 5.5 ppm would be the H on C2, which is a doublet due to coupling with the H on C3.

Wait, but that would require the H's on C2 and C3 to be each a doublet, which fits the data.

In this scenario, the 7.0 ppm is the H on C3 (CH), and the 5.5 is the H on C2 (CH2), but wait, the H on C2 is a CH2, which has two H's, so their signal would be a doublet due to coupling with the single H on C3.

So the CH2 group would show as a doublet at around 5.5 ppm, and the H on C3 would show as a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

That fits the data.

Now, considering the configuration (cis or trans), the coupling constant J would be larger in the trans configuration. So if the substituents are trans, the J would be around 16 Hz, which matches the data.

So, if the structure is trans-butenyl acetate, the H on C3 would be trans to the H on C2, leading to a larger J.

Wait, but wait, in the trans configuration, the substituents on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides. So the H on C3 would be on the opposite side of the double bond from the H on C2.

Wait, but in this case, the H on C2 is part of a CH2 group, so perhaps it's not directly across from the H on C3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents. Let me think again.

In trans-butenyl acetate (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc), the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the CH2 groups are across from each other. So the H's on the CH2 groups (C2 and C3) would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling J.

So, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to the H on C3 (CH2), but wait, each CH2 has two H's. So the H's on C2 would be coupled to the two H's on C3, leading to a triplet.

But the given data has a doublet for 5.5 ppm. So perhaps this isn't right.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Perhaps the substituent is such that one of the H's is on a CH group, and the other is on a CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would introduce a methyl branch, which is indicated in the NMR with a doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Wait, the NMR has a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) group would have a methyl group attached, leading to the 1.6 ppm signal.

In that case, the H on the CH(CH2CH3) would be a doublet due to coupling with the H's on the adjacent CH2 group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2OAc. Then, the H on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be coupled to the H on the double bond, leading to specific splitting.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which is a methyl group. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc, but that would require a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, and the 1.6 ppm is the terminal CH2 group. But then why would it be a doublet?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, and the H's on the terminal CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2, leading to a doublet.

But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to match the J value of 16 Hz with a trans configuration.

So, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons. Therefore, the structure must have a trans double bond.

Which options have a trans double bond? Options B and D.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

But as discussed earlier, propenyl groups with a trans configuration may not show the correct splitting in the NMR.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

In this structure, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides, leading to a larger J.

So, the H's on C2 and C3 would have a larger J, around 16 Hz, which fits the 7.0 ppm signal.

So, the H's on C2 and C3 would each be a doublet, but wait, the CH2 groups would have two H's each, so their signals would be doublets.

Wait, but the given data has only one H each, which suggests that perhaps the structure is such that only one H is present on each of those carbons.

Ah, no, because in butenyl groups, each CH2 group has two H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the butenyl group with a trans double bond would have two CH2 groups on either side of the double bond.

So, the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the H's on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond and coupled to the H's on C3 (CH2). Each H on C2 would be a doublet, and each H on C3 would be a doublet.

But in the NMR, only one H is observed for each, which suggests that perhaps the substituent is such that each CH has only one H.

Wait, no, that can't be. Each CH2 has two H's.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is such that the H's on C2 and C3 are each a doublet due to coupling with each other across the double bond.

Wait, but that would require a long-range coupling, which is possible in some cases, like allylic coupling, but that usually has smaller J values.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to diastereotopic protons.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to make a decision.

The J=16 Hz at 7.0 suggests a trans coupling, which is more likely in a trans double bond.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 next to a double bond.

Putting it all together, the structure is likely Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D), as it has a trans double bond leading to a large J value, and the methyl group would fit the 1.6 ppm signal.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

1H NMR (ppm):  
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)  
- 5.5 (1H, dq)  
- 2.1 (3H, s)  
- 1.6 (3H, d)  

### Key Analysis:
1. **Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**:
   - The **7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a proton coupled to one other proton with a large coupling constant, characteristic of a trans coupling across a double bond.
   - The **5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (1H)** suggests a proton coupled to two non-equivalent protons, likely due to its position near a double bond.
   - The **2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) functional group.
   - The **1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** indicates a methyl group attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

2. **Structural Considerations**:
   - **Propenyl acetate** (CH2=CHCH2-OAc) has a terminal double bond. The protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond would typically appear as a doublet around 5.5 ppm, and the proton on the CH group would appear as a triplet around 6.5 ppm. However, the given data does not match this pattern, as the 7.0 ppm signal suggests a larger coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), which is more consistent with a trans double bond.

   - **Butenyl acetate** (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc) has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, allowing for cis and trans configurations. In the **trans configuration**, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the protons on C2 and C3. This matches the 7.0 ppm doublet. The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets corresponds to the protons on C2 or C3, which are coupled to two non-equivalent protons. The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to the methyl group on the terminal CH2.

3. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **Cis-propenyl acetate** and **Trans-propenyl acetate**: These cannot explain the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) observed at 7.0 ppm, as propenyl groups lack sufficient substituents on both sides of the double bond to exhibit such a large J.
   - **Cis-butenyl acetate**: In the cis configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side, resulting in a smaller coupling constant (J < 16 Hz). This does not match the data.
   - **Trans-butenyl acetate**: This structure has a trans double bond, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the protons on C2 and C3. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts in the NMR data align with this structure.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it explains the large coupling constant, the splitting patterns, and the chemical shifts.

Answer: D
