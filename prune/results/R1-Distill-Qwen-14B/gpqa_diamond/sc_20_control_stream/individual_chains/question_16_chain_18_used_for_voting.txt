Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when there's chirality in the moleculeâ€”so the presence of a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. No, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but this is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. But wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the first carbon is CHCl2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be substituting a CH2Cl. So the structure would be CHCl2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So that's CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but with a substituent on carbon 2. Oh wait, 2-methyl. So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, but wait. The formula is but-1-ene, which is four carbons, double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, so CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Also, 2-methyl would be a methyl group on C2. So C2 has CH(CH3). So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons, right? No, but wait, but-1-ene is four carbons. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

Wait, maybe but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So CHCl=CHCH2CH3. And 2-methyl would have a methyl on C2. So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. No, but but has four. Oh, wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro: CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Then 2-methyl would be CH2Cl on C1, but wait, C1 is CHCl, so perhaps it's CHCl2? No, because the formula is 1-chloro, so only one Cl. So it's CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but that's four carbons. Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but would be four carbons. So, 1-chloro is on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 if it's 1-chlorobutane, but with a double bond. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be three carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which is CH(CH3). So the structure would be ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because it's but-1-ene, so four carbons. So maybe:

Numbering from left to right: C1, C2, C3, C4.

C1: CH2Cl

Wait, no. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH=CHCH3? No, that's 1-chlorobut-1-ene. Wait, but in the question, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Oh, so the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that would make the substituents on C2. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the structure. Let me think about the double bond. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3.

In the case of (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be Cl and a methyl. So on C1 (CHCl), and C2 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But that would have the Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2.

But wait, but-1-ene is four carbons, so the substituents would be on C1 and C2.

So the molecule is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's a single bond. Wait, but the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the correct structure would be CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but is four, so maybe it's CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five again. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would be three carbons. No, but but is four. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CHCl=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's longer than four.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Replacing one H on C1 with Cl gives CHCl=CHCH2CH3. But the 2-methyl would add a methyl group on C2, making it CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But that would be five carbons, which doesn't make sense for but. Oh, wait, but but has four carbons, so perhaps the substituents are on C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be three carbons, but but is four. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of a double bond in but-1-ene and substituents.

Regardless, the key point is whether this compound has a chiral center. Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So for any of these compounds, if there's a carbon with four different substituents, it's chiral and would have optical activity.

So looking at the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's look at C2. If C2 has a methyl group, a double bond to C1, and two other substituents, perhaps a hydrogen and another group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond, so no double bond. No, but it is but-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Maybe I'm wrong. Another approach: perhaps the substituents are on the double bond.

But another thought: maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are same, then it might not be chiral.

Alternatively, the molecule could have a double bond with E or Z configuration, but that doesn't directly affect chirality unless there's a stereogenic center.

Wait, but in this case, is there a chiral center in the molecule? Let's see. For (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:

The structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is CHCl, C2 is CH(CH3). So let's see: C1 is attached to Cl, a double bond (so that's two groups: CHCl), then C2 is CH(CH3), which is attached to three other groups: the double bond, a methyl, and two Hs perhaps.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is CHCl, double bonded to C2, which is CH(CH3). So the groups attached to C1 would be Cl, two Hs (since it's CHCl), and a double bond to C2. Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure again.

Another approach: each carbon in the double bond would have two substituents. C1 has Cl and a CH2 group (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3). Wait, but 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So C1 would be CHCl and CH2CH3? No, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because if the molecule is planar around the double bond, maybe it's not chiral. Wait, but even if it's planar, if there's a stereogenic center elsewhere, it would be chiral.

Wait, maybe I should focus on whether any of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Let's think: the Cl is on C1. C1 is attached to Cl, a double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps a CH2 and a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons, so that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, so no double bond. But the question says but-1-ene, which is a double bond. So I'm really stuck here. Maybe I'll come back to this and look at the other compounds first.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Hmm, this is a complex structure. Let me parse the name. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a benzene ring fused to a furan ring, connected by a methylene group. The substituents here include two ketone groups (dione), and an E configuration on the chloromethylene group.

   The molecule has a bridge or a ring structure, perhaps. The substituents are at specific positions, and the stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E).

   The question is whether this molecule is chiral. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it wouldn't be chiral. Alternatively, if the stereogenic centers are present.

   But given the substituents and the notation, perhaps this molecule has multiple stereogenic centers. But the E configuration on the chloromethylene group might not contribute to chirality unless it's connected in a way that creates a chiral center.

   Alternatively, the molecule might have a bridged structure which could lead to some symmetry. I'm not sure. This one is a bit tricky, perhaps it's not chiral because of some symmetry. Or maybe it is because of the substituents.

   Hmm, maybe I'll skip this for now and come back.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid has four carbons with two carboxylic acid groups. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But when it's 2,3-dimethyl, the middle two carbons have methyl groups.

   The substituents are at C2 and C3, each with methyl groups. The stereochemistry is (2R,3S). So each of those carbons is a stereogenic center.

   Wait, are these stereogenic centers present? Let's see: each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has four different groups.

   For C2: attached to two methyl groups (from the adjacent CH(CH3)), wait no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, if it's 2,3-dimethyl, then C2 has a methyl and C3 has a methyl.

   So for C2: groups would be -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (C3), and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid. When 2,3-dimethyl, it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. Let's look at C2: groups are -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (C3), and two methyl groups (from CH(CH3))? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so substituents are:

   - one COOH from C1,
   - two CH3 groups,
   - and the other substituent is CH(CH3) from C3.

   Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, wait, in a CH(CH3) group, the substituents are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3 groups? No, that can't be right. Let me count again.

   The structure is:

   HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH3?) No, wait, it's 2,3-dimethyl, so each of those carbons has a methyl group.

   So for C2: attached to:

   - C1 (COOH),
   - two methyl groups (since it's CH(CH3)),
   - and C3 (which is another CH(CH3)).

   Wait, that would mean C2 has substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH(CH3), and a hydrogen? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

   Wait, no. Structure:

   The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents:

   For C2:

   - One COOH (from C1),
   - One CH(CH3) (from C3),
   - Two methyl groups (from the CH(CH3) structure).

   Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has three substituents: two CH3 and one CH2? No, wait, let's think in terms of bonds.

   Each CH(CH3) group has three bonds: one to the previous carbon (C1 or C3), and two to methyl groups. So for C2:

   - Bond 1: to C1 (COOH group),
   - Bond 2: to C3 (which is CH(CH3)),
   - Bond 3: two methyl groups.

   Wait, but that's not possible. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So each CH(CH3) has:

   - One bond to C1 (for C2),
   - One bond to C3 (for C2),
   - And two bonds to methyl groups.

   Wait, no, that's incorrect because CH(CH3) implies a carbon with three substituents: one is a CH3 and two are CH2 groups? No, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe a better approach is to determine if the molecule has any chiral centers.

   The compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Each of the C2 and C3 carbons has four different groups, making them chiral centers. So each of these carbons is a stereogenic center, meaning the molecule has two chiral centers. Therefore, it is optically active.

   So this compound is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Similar to compound 3. The configuration is (2R,3R). Again, each of the C2 and C3 carbons is a chiral center. So this compound is also optically active.

   So both 3 and 4 are active. So that's two so far.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexanol derivative with a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. So the hydroxyl group is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

   The molecule might have a chiral center at C1. Let's check. For the cyclohexanol part, the OH is on C1. The substituents around C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - Two adjacent CH2 groups (since it's a cyclohexane ring),
   - And the rest of the ring.

   Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So for C1, the substituents would be:

   - OH group,
   - Two CH2 groups (from the ring),
   - And the ring itself, which perhaps counts as another substituent.

   Wait, but wait: for a carbon in a ring, the substituents are the two adjacent ring carbons, plus any other attached groups. So in cyclohexanol, the C1 would have:

   - OH,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And the ring's structure.

   Wait, but that's three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon in the ring has two adjacent ring carbons (like C2 and C6), and the other two bonds are for substituents or hydrogen.

   Hmm, but for C1 in cyclohexanol, the structure is CH2OH attached to the ring. Wait, no, cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with one OH on a CH2 group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxyl group on C1, which is a CH2 group.

   So, the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And a hydrogen (since it's CH2OH).

   Wait, no, wait. The structure is cyclohexane with an OH on C1. So each carbon in the ring is connected to two others. The substituents on C1 would be:

   - The OH group,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And a hydrogen.

   Wait, but CH2OH implies that C1 has two CH2 groups (from the ring), an OH, and a hydrogen. So the substituents are H, OH, CH2CH2 (ring), and another CH2CH2. Wait, but that's not four different groups. So does C1 have four different substituents?

   Let me imagine the structure. C1 has a hydroxyl group, and is connected to C2 and C6 (each of which is a CH2 group). The other substituent is a hydrogen. So the four groups attached to C1 are: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6?), and H. Wait, but if C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, then C1 is attached to two identical substituents, which would make it not a chiral center.

   Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. If C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, then C1 has substituents: OH, H, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6). That would mean two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), so C1 doesn't have four different groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

   Wait, but in this compound, the double bond is at position 3 (cyclohex-3-en). So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4.

   How does that affect the substituents on C1? Perhaps the ring's geometry makes the substituents on C1 different.

   Alternatively, maybe the double bond introduces some asymmetry elsewhere. But C1's substituents would still be OH, H, and two CH2 groups from the ring. So same as before.

   Wait, but maybe the double bond makes the ring non-planar, but that doesn't necessarily affect the substituents on C1. So perhaps C1 isn't a chiral center, making the molecule not chiral. But wait, the question says the configuration is R. So maybe I'm wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has another chiral center. Let me think again. The compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

   So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH on C1.

   Let me imagine the structure: C1 has OH, adjacent to C2 and C6. The ring is connected with double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 is attached to C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is CH2), OH, and H. So if C2 and C6 are both CH2, then C1 has substituents OH, H, and two CH2 groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center, which would mean the molecule isn't chiral. But the compound is labeled as R, which suggests a chiral center. So perhaps I'm missing something.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has another chiral center elsewhere. Let me check other carbons. For example, C3 and C4 are double-bonded, so they can't be chiral centers. C2 is CH2, so not a chiral center. C5 and C6 may have substituents. Wait, perhaps the double bond makes some of the substituents different.

   Hmm, perhaps the (R) configuration refers to a different carbon. Or maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the ring's substituents are arranged in such a way that C1 is a chiral center. For example, if C2 and C6 have different substituents.

   Alternatively, perhaps the ring isn't symmetrical due to the double bond, making C1 a chiral center. But since C2 and C6 are both CH2, I'm not sure.

   Another thought: cyclohexene has a certain geometry, which might make C1 have different substituents. For example, if the double bond causes the ring to be non-planar, and the substituents on C1 are arranged asymmetrically. But I'm not certain.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on either side of the ring are mirror images, making it achiral. But the presence of a double bond could break that symmetry.

   I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't be chiral. But with a double bond in the ring, symmetry might be broken.

   Another approach: the configuration is given as R. So the molecule must have a chiral center, meaning this compound is optically active. So I think this one is active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three are s configuration. Since all three are s, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry.

   Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on alternate positions. So C1, C3, and C5 have OH groups. This would mean the OH groups are every other carbon, creating a trigonal symmetry. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, if the OH groups are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. But in this case, with three OH groups on every other carbon, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Wait, but having three substituents on a ring could lead to asymmetry. Let me visualize: if the ring has OH on C1, C3, and C5, it's like having three substituents spaced 120 degrees apart. That might create a symmetrical structure, perhaps with a plane of symmetry.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement isn't symmetrical. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about whether this molecule is meso or not.

   Wait, when a molecule has multiple stereogenic centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry, it's called meso. So maybe this molecule is meso, making it achiral.

   So, for example, in meso compounds, the molecule has multiple stereogenic centers but is achiral because of symmetry.

   In this case, the molecule has three stereogenic centers (C1, C3, C5) with s configuration. But with three OH groups, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine looking down the ring: positions 1, 3, 5 would form an equilateral arrangement. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents are all the same (OH groups), but their positions could create symmetry.

   Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: what's the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol? It's a triol with three OH groups in the 1,3,5 positions. This would create a structure that's similar to a trigonal planar arrangement, but in a ring. So perhaps it's symmetrical, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three OH groups are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. But I'm not certain. I think this one is achiral and thus not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

   Let's look for chiral centers. The carbonyl group is on C1, with a cyclopentyl group attached. The other carbons are CH2 groups. So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

   - Cyclopentyl,
   - Carbonyl oxygen,
   - And two CH2 groups.

   Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO for acetone, but this is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So structure would be:

   O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl?

   Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

   Wait, but the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So the structure is:

   O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)- ?

   No, that doesn't fit. Let me try again.

   The structure is:

   The butanone is four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So:

   C1: CO
   C2: CH2
   C3: CH(CH3)
   C4: CH3?

   Wait, but the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So:

   C1: CO attached to cyclopentyl and another group (which would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3?).

   Wait, perhaps the structure is:

   cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   So the molecule is:

   O=C-cyclopentyl-CH2-CH(CH3)2 ?

   Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the substituents. The carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to the cyclopentyl group and another CH2 group. The CH2 is attached to a CH(CH3) and another CH3.

   Now, looking for chiral centers. Let's check each carbon:

   C1: CO, cyclopentyl, CH2, and another CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's attached to CO, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So no, C1 isn't a chiral center.

   C2: CH2, attached to CO-C1, two CH2 groups, and another CH(CH3). So C2 is CH2, so not a chiral center.

   C3: CH(CH3). Attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two CH3 groups from the methyl substituent. So substituents: CH2, CH3, and two CH3? No, wait, the CH(CH3) would have substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from substituent), and two CH3 groups? That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is attached to CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), and two CH3 groups. Wait, but that's four substituents. Let's see:

   For C3 (CH(CH3)):

   - One bond to C2 (CH2 group),
   - One bond to C4 (CH3 group),
   - Two bonds to CH3 groups (from the substituent and perhaps another part).

   Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look for any carbon with four different groups.

   C3 has:

   - CH2 (from C2),
   - CH3 (from substituent),
   - two CH3 groups (since it's CH(CH3)).

   So the substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from substituent), and two CH3 (from the branching). So C3 has two identical groups (CH3). Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

   So, none of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical activity.

   Wait, but wait. What about the cyclopentyl group? Could that introduce some asymmetry? The cyclopentyl is a substituent on C1, but it's a ring. If the cyclopentyl ring has substituents, it could create a chiral center, but in this case, the cyclopentyl group is just a cyclopentane ring attached. So it's a symmetric group, perhaps, making the entire molecule symmetric.

   So this compound has no chiral centers and is not optically active.

So, to recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not sure. I thought earlier that maybe the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, but I'm not certain.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Not sure. Maybe it's chiral because of the substituents.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Optically active (two chiral centers).
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: I'm not sure. Earlier thought was maybe no, but the configuration suggests a chiral center. So probably active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Possibly not active due to symmetry.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Not active.

Now, let's reevaluate the first compound.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:

   Let me try to determine if there's a chiral center. The structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3.

   Wait, but but has four carbons, so maybe it's CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3 is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CHCl=CH(CH2CH3).

   No, I'm getting stuck again. Let's think differently. If the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either end, whether it leads to any chiral centers.

   In (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents on C1 and C2 are Cl and CH(CH3).

   Wait, perhaps C2 has a CH(CH3) group. So C2 is attached to C1 (Cl), C3 (CH2), and other substituents. Wait, but perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded, making it a trigonal planar geometry.

   Wait, no, because double bonds are spÂ² hybridized, and the carbons in double bonds can't be chiral centers. So the only possible chiral centers would be on carbons not involved in the double bond.

   So in this molecule, the only carbons not involved in the double bond are C3 and C4. Let's see: C3 is CH2, so not a chiral center. C4 is CH3, so also not a chiral center. Therefore, no chiral centers here. So this compound isn't optically active.

   So compound 1: not active.

Then, moving to compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This structure is a bit complex. Let's think: The molecule is a bicyclic structure, with substituents including a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) in the E configuration.

The substituents are on a bridge, perhaps. The molecule has specific stereochemistry at positions 3a and 7a, which are stereogenic centers. The E configuration of the chloromethylene group may contribute to the structure but not directly to chirality.

So, considering the substituents, 3a and 7a have R and S configurations, respectively. Therefore, each is a stereogenic center. Additionally, the molecule might not have an internal plane of symmetry because of the bridge and substituents. Therefore, this molecule is chiral and optically active.

So compound 2: active.

So now, let's count the active compounds:

Active:

3: Yes â†’ count 1
4: Yes â†’ count 2
5: Yes â†’ count 3
2: Yes â†’ count 4

Wait, earlier I thought compound 5 is active.

Wait, let's recount:

Compounds 3,4,5,2: active.

So that's four.

Wait, wait, what about compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

Earlier, I was confused but concluded that it's active. But perhaps it's not.

Wait, let me think again. If C1 isn't a chiral center, then the molecule isn't active. But the compound is given as R, which implies a chiral center. So perhaps C1 is a chiral center.

In the molecule, C1 has OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would mean two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral, making it not optically active.

But that contradicts the (R) designation, which suggests a chiral center. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the double bond in the ring causes the substituents on C1 to be different. For example, the arrangement of the ring due to the double bond makes C1's substituents different. So perhaps C1 is a chiral center after all.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond isn't in a position that affects the substituents on C1.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The hydroxyl is on C1.

So, in the ring, C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- H.

So, two substituents are the same (CH2 from C2 and C6), so C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral and isn't optically active. But then, why is it given as (R)? That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the configuration refers to a different carbon. Maybe the double bond isn't in position 3 but elsewhere, but the name says 3-en. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the positions. Let me number the ring as follows: C1 (OH), C2, C3 (double bond), C4, C5, C6.

So the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, on C1, the substituents are:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- H.

So again, substituents are OH, H, and two CH2 groups â†’ not a chiral center.

But if the molecule has (R) configuration, then there must be a chiral center. So perhaps I'm missing a chiral center elsewhere.

Looking at C3 and C4, which are double-bonded. They can't be chiral centers. C5 is CH2, so not chiral. C2 is CH2, same. C6 is CH2. So where else could a chiral center be?

Wait, perhaps the double bond is exo or endo, but that doesn't create a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is on a different position, making another carbon a chiral center. I'm really confused here.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the double bond leads to some substituents being different. For instance, if the ring isn't symmetric, perhaps C1's substituents are all different.

Wait, perhaps the ring is in a chair conformation, and the substituents are arranged in such a way that C1's substituents are different. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because the configuration is R, but that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck on this one.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed and see how many of the other compounds are active.

So, to recap:

Active compounds:

3: Yes â†’ 1
4: Yes â†’ 2
2: Yes â†’ 3
5: I'm not sure. If not active, then 3. If active, then 4.

6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Earlier thought was not active due to symmetry. So not active.

7: Not active.

So if compound 5 isn't active, then the total is 3 active compounds (2,3,4). But wait, earlier I thought 2 is active.

Wait, no. Let me recount:

Compounds:

1: No
2: Yes â†’ 1
3: Yes â†’ 2
4: Yes â†’ 3
5: Maybe no â†’ 3
6: No
7: No

So total would be 3 active.

But earlier I thought compound 5 might be active, but now I'm uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count it as active because the configuration is R, which implies a chiral center. So perhaps the molecule is active, making the total 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought C1 isn't a chiral center. So, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral, making the total active compounds 3 (2,3,4).

But earlier I thought compound 2 is active. So 2,3,4 would be three.

Wait, let me think again:

Compounds 2,3,4 are definitely active.

Compounds 1: no.

Compounds 5: uncertain. If active, 4; if not, 3.

Compounds 6 and 7: no.

So the question is whether compound 5 is active.

If compound 5 is not active, the total is 3 (2,3,4). If it is, then 4.

But earlier I thought compound 5 isn't active. So the count would be 3.

But let's think about the molecule again. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

The molecule has a cyclohexene ring with an OH on C1. C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and H. So if two substituents are same (CH2 groups), then C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, no optical activity.

So compound 5: no.

Thus, active compounds are 2,3,4 â†’ 3.

But wait, earlier I thought compound 2 is active, which makes the total 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 2 is active. So 3 in total.

Wait, but let me recount:

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)â€¦ â†’ yes, it has two stereogenic centers, so active.

3: yes.

4: yes.

That's three.

Wait, no. 2,3,4 â†’ three active, so option B is 3.

But wait, the options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be 3.

Wait, but I thought compound 2 is active, which is one, 3 is another, and 4 is the third. So three active compounds.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 5 was not active. So three in total.

But let me recount all seven compounds:

1: No
2: Yes â†’ 1
3: Yes â†’ 2
4: Yes â†’3
5: No
6: No
7: No.

So that's three active compounds.

So the answer should be option B) 3.

To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which typically arises from stereogenic centers or other forms of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on these carbons are such that C1 (Cl, double bond) and C2 (CH(CH3), double bond) are spÂ² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Additionally, no other carbon in the molecule has four different substituents.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a complex bicyclic structure with specific stereochemistry at positions 3a and 7a. These positions are stereogenic centers, and the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry due to the substituents and bridge structure.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has four carbons, with carboxylic acid groups at C1 and C4. The middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group and are stereogenic centers due to their four different substituents.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to compound 3, the middle carbons (C2 and C3) are stereogenic centers with four different substituents.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. C1 is attached to OH, H, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6). Since two substituents are identical (CH2 groups), C1 is not a chiral center. Thus, the molecule lacks chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at C1, C3, and C5. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the alternating positions of the hydroxyl groups, making it achiral despite the stereogenic centers.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl group is at C1, with a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group attached. The other carbons (C2, C3, and C4) are CH2 or CH groups and do not have four different substituents. The cyclopentyl group is symmetric and does not introduce chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Final Count of Optically Active Compounds:
- Compound 2: Yes  
- Compound 3: Yes  
- Compound 4: Yes  

Total: **3 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when there's chirality in the moleculeâ€”so the presence of a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. No, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but this is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. But wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the first carbon is CHCl2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be substituting a CH2Cl. So the structure would be CHCl2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So that's CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but with a substituent on carbon 2. Oh wait, 2-methyl. So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, but wait. The formula is but-1-ene, which is four carbons, double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, so CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Also, 2-methyl would be a methyl group on C2. So C2 has CH(CH3). So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons, right? No, but wait, but-1-ene is four carbons. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

Wait, maybe but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So CHCl=CHCH2CH3. And 2-methyl would have a methyl on C2. So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. No, but but has four. Oh, wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro: CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Then 2-methyl would be CH2Cl on C1, but wait, C1 is CHCl, so perhaps it's CHCl2? No, because the formula is 1-chloro, so only one Cl. So it's CHCl=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but that's four carbons. Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but would be four carbons. So, 1-chloro is on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 if it's 1-chlorobutane, but with a double bond. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be three carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which is CH(CH3). So the structure would be ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because it's but-1-ene, so four carbons. So maybe:

Numbering from left to right: C1, C2, C3, C4.

C1: CH2Cl

Wait, no. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH=CHCH3? No, that's 1-chlorobut-1-ene. Wait, but in the question, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Oh, so the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that would make the substituents on C2. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the structure. Let me think about the double bond. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3.

In the case of (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be Cl and a methyl. So on C1 (CHCl), and C2 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But that would have the Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2.

But wait, but-1-ene is four carbons, so the substituents would be on C1 and C2.

So the molecule is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's a single bond. Wait, but the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the correct structure would be CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but is four, so maybe it's CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five again. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would be three carbons. No, but but is four. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CHCl=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's longer than four.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Replacing one H on C1 with Cl gives CHCl=CHCH2CH3. But the 2-methyl would add a methyl group on C2, making it CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But that would be five carbons, which doesn't make sense for but. Oh, wait, but but has four carbons, so perhaps the substituents are on C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be three carbons, but but is four. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of a double bond in but-1-ene and substituents.

Regardless, the key point is whether this compound has a chiral center. Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So for any of these compounds, if there's a carbon with four different substituents, it's chiral and would have optical activity.

So looking at the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's look at C2. If C2 has a methyl group, a double bond to C1, and two other substituents, perhaps a hydrogen and another group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond, so no double bond. No, but it is but-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Maybe I'm wrong. Another approach: perhaps the substituents are on the double bond.

But another thought: maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are same, then it might not be chiral.

Alternatively, the molecule could have a double bond with E or Z configuration, but that doesn't directly affect chirality unless there's a stereogenic center.

Wait, but in this case, is there a chiral center in the molecule? Let's see. For (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:

The structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is CHCl, C2 is CH(CH3). So let's see: C1 is attached to Cl, a double bond (so that's two groups: CHCl), then C2 is CH(CH3), which is attached to three other groups: the double bond, a methyl, and two Hs perhaps.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is CHCl, double bonded to C2, which is CH(CH3). So the groups attached to C1 would be Cl, two Hs (since it's CHCl), and a double bond to C2. Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure again.

Another approach: each carbon in the double bond would have two substituents. C1 has Cl and a CH2 group (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3). Wait, but 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So C1 would be CHCl and CH2CH3? No, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because if the molecule is planar around the double bond, maybe it's not chiral. Wait, but even if it's planar, if there's a stereogenic center elsewhere, it would be chiral.

Wait, maybe I should focus on whether any of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Let's think: the Cl is on C1. C1 is attached to Cl, a double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps a CH2 and a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons, so that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, so no double bond. But the question says but-1-ene, which is a double bond. So I'm really stuck here. Maybe I'll come back to this and look at the other compounds first.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Hmm, this is a complex structure. Let me parse the name. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a benzene ring fused to a furan ring, connected by a methylene group. The substituents here include two ketone groups (dione), and an E configuration on the chloromethylene group.

   The molecule has a bridge or a ring structure, perhaps. The substituents are at specific positions, and the stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E).

   The question is whether this molecule is chiral. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it wouldn't be chiral. Alternatively, if the stereogenic centers are present.

   But given the substituents and the notation, perhaps this molecule has multiple stereogenic centers. But the E configuration on the chloromethylene group might not contribute to chirality unless it's connected in a way that creates a chiral center.

   Alternatively, the molecule might have a bridged structure which could lead to some symmetry. I'm not sure. This one is a bit tricky, perhaps it's not chiral because of some symmetry. Or maybe it is because of the substituents.

   Hmm, maybe I'll skip this for now and come back.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid has four carbons with two carboxylic acid groups. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But when it's 2,3-dimethyl, the middle two carbons have methyl groups.

   The substituents are at C2 and C3, each with methyl groups. The stereochemistry is (2R,3S). So each of those carbons is a stereogenic center.

   Wait, are these stereogenic centers present? Let's see: each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has four different groups.

   For C2: attached to two methyl groups (from the adjacent CH(CH3)), wait no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, if it's 2,3-dimethyl, then C2 has a methyl and C3 has a methyl.

   So for C2: groups would be -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (C3), and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid. When 2,3-dimethyl, it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. Let's look at C2: groups are -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (C3), and two methyl groups (from CH(CH3))? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so substituents are:

   - one COOH from C1,
   - two CH3 groups,
   - and the other substituent is CH(CH3) from C3.

   Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, wait, in a CH(CH3) group, the substituents are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3 groups? No, that can't be right. Let me count again.

   The structure is:

   HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH3?) No, wait, it's 2,3-dimethyl, so each of those carbons has a methyl group.

   So for C2: attached to:

   - C1 (COOH),
   - two methyl groups (since it's CH(CH3)),
   - and C3 (which is another CH(CH3)).

   Wait, that would mean C2 has substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH(CH3), and a hydrogen? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

   Wait, no. Structure:

   The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents:

   For C2:

   - One COOH (from C1),
   - One CH(CH3) (from C3),
   - Two methyl groups (from the CH(CH3) structure).

   Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has three substituents: two CH3 and one CH2? No, wait, let's think in terms of bonds.

   Each CH(CH3) group has three bonds: one to the previous carbon (C1 or C3), and two to methyl groups. So for C2:

   - Bond 1: to C1 (COOH group),
   - Bond 2: to C3 (which is CH(CH3)),
   - Bond 3: two methyl groups.

   Wait, but that's not possible. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So each CH(CH3) has:

   - One bond to C1 (for C2),
   - One bond to C3 (for C2),
   - And two bonds to methyl groups.

   Wait, no, that's incorrect because CH(CH3) implies a carbon with three substituents: one is a CH3 and two are CH2 groups? No, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe a better approach is to determine if the molecule has any chiral centers.

   The compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Each of the C2 and C3 carbons has four different groups, making them chiral centers. So each of these carbons is a stereogenic center, meaning the molecule has two chiral centers. Therefore, it is optically active.

   So this compound is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Similar to compound 3. The configuration is (2R,3R). Again, each of the C2 and C3 carbons is a chiral center. So this compound is also optically active.

   So both 3 and 4 are active. So that's two so far.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexanol derivative with a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. So the hydroxyl group is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

   The molecule might have a chiral center at C1. Let's check. For the cyclohexanol part, the OH is on C1. The substituents around C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - Two adjacent CH2 groups (since it's a cyclohexane ring),
   - And the rest of the ring.

   Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So for C1, the substituents would be:

   - OH group,
   - Two CH2 groups (from the ring),
   - And the ring itself, which perhaps counts as another substituent.

   Wait, but wait: for a carbon in a ring, the substituents are the two adjacent ring carbons, plus any other attached groups. So in cyclohexanol, the C1 would have:

   - OH,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And the ring's structure.

   Wait, but that's three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon in the ring has two adjacent ring carbons (like C2 and C6), and the other two bonds are for substituents or hydrogen.

   Hmm, but for C1 in cyclohexanol, the structure is CH2OH attached to the ring. Wait, no, cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with one OH on a CH2 group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxyl group on C1, which is a CH2 group.

   So, the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And a hydrogen (since it's CH2OH).

   Wait, no, wait. The structure is cyclohexane with an OH on C1. So each carbon in the ring is connected to two others. The substituents on C1 would be:

   - The OH group,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And a hydrogen.

   Wait, but CH2OH implies that C1 has two CH2 groups (from the ring), an OH, and a hydrogen. So the substituents are H, OH, CH2CH2 (ring), and another CH2CH2. Wait, but that's not four different groups. So does C1 have four different substituents?

   Let me imagine the structure. C1 has a hydroxyl group, and is connected to C2 and C6 (each of which is a CH2 group). The other substituent is a hydrogen. So the four groups attached to C1 are: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6?), and H. Wait, but if C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, then C1 is attached to two identical substituents, which would make it not a chiral center.

   Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. If C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, then C1 has substituents: OH, H, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6). That would mean two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), so C1 doesn't have four different groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

   Wait, but in this compound, the double bond is at position 3 (cyclohex-3-en). So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4.

   How does that affect the substituents on C1? Perhaps the ring's geometry makes the substituents on C1 different.

   Alternatively, maybe the double bond introduces some asymmetry elsewhere. But C1's substituents would still be OH, H, and two CH2 groups from the ring. So same as before.

   Wait, but maybe the double bond makes the ring non-planar, but that doesn't necessarily affect the substituents on C1. So perhaps C1 isn't a chiral center, making the molecule not chiral. But wait, the question says the configuration is R. So maybe I'm wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has another chiral center. Let me think again. The compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

   So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH on C1.

   Let me imagine the structure: C1 has OH, adjacent to C2 and C6. The ring is connected with double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 is attached to C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is CH2), OH, and H. So if C2 and C6 are both CH2, then C1 has substituents OH, H, and two CH2 groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center, which would mean the molecule isn't chiral. But the compound is labeled as R, which suggests a chiral center. So perhaps I'm missing something.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has another chiral center elsewhere. Let me check other carbons. For example, C3 and C4 are double-bonded, so they can't be chiral centers. C2 is CH2, so not a chiral center. C5 and C6 may have substituents. Wait, perhaps the double bond makes some of the substituents different.

   Hmm, perhaps the (R) configuration refers to a different carbon. Or maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the ring's substituents are arranged in such a way that C1 is a chiral center. For example, if C2 and C6 have different substituents.

   Alternatively, perhaps the ring isn't symmetrical due to the double bond, making C1 a chiral center. But since C2 and C6 are both CH2, I'm not sure.

   Another thought: cyclohexene has a certain geometry, which might make C1 have different substituents. For example, if the double bond causes the ring to be non-planar, and the substituents on C1 are arranged asymmetrically. But I'm not certain.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on either side of the ring are mirror images, making it achiral. But the presence of a double bond could break that symmetry.

   I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't be chiral. But with a double bond in the ring, symmetry might be broken.

   Another approach: the configuration is given as R. So the molecule must have a chiral center, meaning this compound is optically active. So I think this one is active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three are s configuration. Since all three are s, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry.

   Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on alternate positions. So C1, C3, and C5 have OH groups. This would mean the OH groups are every other carbon, creating a trigonal symmetry. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, if the OH groups are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. But in this case, with three OH groups on every other carbon, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Wait, but having three substituents on a ring could lead to asymmetry. Let me visualize: if the ring has OH on C1, C3, and C5, it's like having three substituents spaced 120 degrees apart. That might create a symmetrical structure, perhaps with a plane of symmetry.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement isn't symmetrical. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about whether this molecule is meso or not.

   Wait, when a molecule has multiple stereogenic centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry, it's called meso. So maybe this molecule is meso, making it achiral.

   So, for example, in meso compounds, the molecule has multiple stereogenic centers but is achiral because of symmetry.

   In this case, the molecule has three stereogenic centers (C1, C3, C5) with s configuration. But with three OH groups, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine looking down the ring: positions 1, 3, 5 would form an equilateral arrangement. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents are all the same (OH groups), but their positions could create symmetry.

   Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: what's the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol? It's a triol with three OH groups in the 1,3,5 positions. This would create a structure that's similar to a trigonal planar arrangement, but in a ring. So perhaps it's symmetrical, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three OH groups are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. But I'm not certain. I think this one is achiral and thus not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

   Let's look for chiral centers. The carbonyl group is on C1, with a cyclopentyl group attached. The other carbons are CH2 groups. So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

   - Cyclopentyl,
   - Carbonyl oxygen,
   - And two CH2 groups.

   Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO for acetone, but this is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So structure would be:

   O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl?

   Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

   Wait, but the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So the structure is:

   O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)- ?

   No, that doesn't fit. Let me try again.

   The structure is:

   The butanone is four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So:

   C1: CO
   C2: CH2
   C3: CH(CH3)
   C4: CH3?

   Wait, but the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So:

   C1: CO attached to cyclopentyl and another group (which would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3?).

   Wait, perhaps the structure is:

   cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   So the molecule is:

   O=C-cyclopentyl-CH2-CH(CH3)2 ?

   Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the substituents. The carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to the cyclopentyl group and another CH2 group. The CH2 is attached to a CH(CH3) and another CH3.

   Now, looking for chiral centers. Let's check each carbon:

   C1: CO, cyclopentyl, CH2, and another CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's attached to CO, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So no, C1 isn't a chiral center.

   C2: CH2, attached to CO-C1, two CH2 groups, and another CH(CH3). So C2 is CH2, so not a chiral center.

   C3: CH(CH3). Attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two CH3 groups from the methyl substituent. So substituents: CH2, CH3, and two CH3? No, wait, the CH(CH3) would have substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from substituent), and two CH3 groups? That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is attached to CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), and two CH3 groups. Wait, but that's four substituents. Let's see:

   For C3 (CH(CH3)):

   - One bond to C2 (CH2 group),
   - One bond to C4 (CH3 group),
   - Two bonds to CH3 groups (from the substituent and perhaps another part).

   Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look for any carbon with four different groups.

   C3 has:

   - CH2 (from C2),
   - CH3 (from substituent),
   - two CH3 groups (since it's CH(CH3)).

   So the substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from substituent), and two CH3 (from the branching). So C3 has two identical groups (CH3). Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

   So, none of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical activity.

   Wait, but wait. What about the cyclopentyl group? Could that introduce some asymmetry? The cyclopentyl is a substituent on C1, but it's a ring. If the cyclopentyl ring has substituents, it could create a chiral center, but in this case, the cyclopentyl group is just a cyclopentane ring attached. So it's a symmetric group, perhaps, making the entire molecule symmetric.

   So this compound has no chiral centers and is not optically active.

So, to recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not sure. I thought earlier that maybe the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, but I'm not certain.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Not sure. Maybe it's chiral because of the substituents.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Optically active (two chiral centers).
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: I'm not sure. Earlier thought was maybe no, but the configuration suggests a chiral center. So probably active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Possibly not active due to symmetry.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Not active.

Now, let's reevaluate the first compound.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:

   Let me try to determine if there's a chiral center. The structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3.

   Wait, but but has four carbons, so maybe it's CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3 is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CHCl=CH(CH2CH3).

   No, I'm getting stuck again. Let's think differently. If the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either end, whether it leads to any chiral centers.

   In (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents on C1 and C2 are Cl and CH(CH3).

   Wait, perhaps C2 has a CH(CH3) group. So C2 is attached to C1 (Cl), C3 (CH2), and other substituents. Wait, but perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded, making it a trigonal planar geometry.

   Wait, no, because double bonds are spÂ² hybridized, and the carbons in double bonds can't be chiral centers. So the only possible chiral centers would be on carbons not involved in the double bond.

   So in this molecule, the only carbons not involved in the double bond are C3 and C4. Let's see: C3 is CH2, so not a chiral center. C4 is CH3, so also not a chiral center. Therefore, no chiral centers here. So this compound isn't optically active.

   So compound 1: not active.

Then, moving to compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This structure is a bit complex. Let's think: The molecule is a bicyclic structure, with substituents including a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) in the E configuration.

The substituents are on a bridge, perhaps. The molecule has specific stereochemistry at positions 3a and 7a, which are stereogenic centers. The E configuration of the chloromethylene group may contribute to the structure but not directly to chirality.

So, considering the substituents, 3a and 7a have R and S configurations, respectively. Therefore, each is a stereogenic center. Additionally, the molecule might not have an internal plane of symmetry because of the bridge and substituents. Therefore, this molecule is chiral and optically active.

So compound 2: active.

So now, let's count the active compounds:

Active:

3: Yes â†’ count 1
4: Yes â†’ count 2
5: Yes â†’ count 3
2: Yes â†’ count 4

Wait, earlier I thought compound 5 is active.

Wait, let's recount:

Compounds 3,4,5,2: active.

So that's four.

Wait, wait, what about compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

Earlier, I was confused but concluded that it's active. But perhaps it's not.

Wait, let me think again. If C1 isn't a chiral center, then the molecule isn't active. But the compound is given as R, which implies a chiral center. So perhaps C1 is a chiral center.

In the molecule, C1 has OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would mean two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral, making it not optically active.

But that contradicts the (R) designation, which suggests a chiral center. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the double bond in the ring causes the substituents on C1 to be different. For example, the arrangement of the ring due to the double bond makes C1's substituents different. So perhaps C1 is a chiral center after all.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond isn't in a position that affects the substituents on C1.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The hydroxyl is on C1.

So, in the ring, C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- H.

So, two substituents are the same (CH2 from C2 and C6), so C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral and isn't optically active. But then, why is it given as (R)? That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the configuration refers to a different carbon. Maybe the double bond isn't in position 3 but elsewhere, but the name says 3-en. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the positions. Let me number the ring as follows: C1 (OH), C2, C3 (double bond), C4, C5, C6.

So the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, on C1, the substituents are:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- H.

So again, substituents are OH, H, and two CH2 groups â†’ not a chiral center.

But if the molecule has (R) configuration, then there must be a chiral center. So perhaps I'm missing a chiral center elsewhere.

Looking at C3 and C4, which are double-bonded. They can't be chiral centers. C5 is CH2, so not chiral. C2 is CH2, same. C6 is CH2. So where else could a chiral center be?

Wait, perhaps the double bond is exo or endo, but that doesn't create a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is on a different position, making another carbon a chiral center. I'm really confused here.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the double bond leads to some substituents being different. For instance, if the ring isn't symmetric, perhaps C1's substituents are all different.

Wait, perhaps the ring is in a chair conformation, and the substituents are arranged in such a way that C1's substituents are different. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because the configuration is R, but that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck on this one.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed and see how many of the other compounds are active.

So, to recap:

Active compounds:

3: Yes â†’ 1
4: Yes â†’ 2
2: Yes â†’ 3
5: I'm not sure. If not active, then 3. If active, then 4.

6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Earlier thought was not active due to symmetry. So not active.

7: Not active.

So if compound 5 isn't active, then the total is 3 active compounds (2,3,4). But wait, earlier I thought 2 is active.

Wait, no. Let me recount:

Compounds:

1: No
2: Yes â†’ 1
3: Yes â†’ 2
4: Yes â†’ 3
5: Maybe no â†’ 3
6: No
7: No

So total would be 3 active.

But earlier I thought compound 5 might be active, but now I'm uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count it as active because the configuration is R, which implies a chiral center. So perhaps the molecule is active, making the total 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought C1 isn't a chiral center. So, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral, making the total active compounds 3 (2,3,4).

But earlier I thought compound 2 is active. So 2,3,4 would be three.

Wait, let me think again:

Compounds 2,3,4 are definitely active.

Compounds 1: no.

Compounds 5: uncertain. If active, 4; if not, 3.

Compounds 6 and 7: no.

So the question is whether compound 5 is active.

If compound 5 is not active, the total is 3 (2,3,4). If it is, then 4.

But earlier I thought compound 5 isn't active. So the count would be 3.

But let's think about the molecule again. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

The molecule has a cyclohexene ring with an OH on C1. C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and H. So if two substituents are same (CH2 groups), then C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, no optical activity.

So compound 5: no.

Thus, active compounds are 2,3,4 â†’ 3.

But wait, earlier I thought compound 2 is active, which makes the total 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 2 is active. So 3 in total.

Wait, but let me recount:

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)â€¦ â†’ yes, it has two stereogenic centers, so active.

3: yes.

4: yes.

That's three.

Wait, no. 2,3,4 â†’ three active, so option B is 3.

But wait, the options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be 3.

Wait, but I thought compound 2 is active, which is one, 3 is another, and 4 is the third. So three active compounds.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 5 was not active. So three in total.

But let me recount all seven compounds:

1: No
2: Yes â†’ 1
3: Yes â†’ 2
4: Yes â†’3
5: No
6: No
7: No.

So that's three active compounds.

So the answer should be option B) 3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which typically arises from stereogenic centers or other forms of asymmetry.
