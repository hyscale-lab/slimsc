Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. I think that method relies on the gravitational interactions between planets causing variations in their transits as seen from Earth. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The question gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3.

Then, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is roughly 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So, Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. Hmm, but wait, does mass affect the orbital period? I'm not sure. Wait, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, I need to find how much longer Planet3's period is than Planet1's.

They also mention that all three have an albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects the amount of light reflected, so the equilibrium temperature depends on that. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by the equation:

Te = T_star * ( ( L_star ) / (16 * pi^2 * sigma * D^2) )^(-1/4) 

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh wait, another way to write the equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, I think the formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( ( R_star ) / ( 2 D ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, perhaps another approach. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16 pi sigma D^2 (1-A)))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, D is the distance from the star, and A is albedo. Since all three planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends on their distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

Wait, but the star's luminosity isn't given differently for each planet, right? Because all three planets orbit the same star, so the L is the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the square root of (D) because L and (1-A) are the same.

Wait, let me get that straight. The formula for Te is (L * (1-A)/(16 pi sigma D^2))^(1/4). So, when taking the ratio of Te between two planets, say Planet1 and Planet2, the L and sigma and (1-A) are the same, so it's proportional to (1/D1^2)^(1/4) over (1/D2^2)^(1/4) which is D2/D1.

Wait, let me re-derive it. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 pi sigma D^2) ]^(1/4 )

So, when we take the ratio Te1/Te2:

Te1/Te2 = [ (L (1-A)/(16 pi sigma D1^2)) / (L (1-A)/(16 pi sigma D2^2)) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (D2^2) / (D1^2) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which is [ (D2/D1)^2 ]^(1/4 ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2) = sqrt(D2/D1)

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, because if D2 > D1, then Te2 would be lower than Te1, assuming all else equal. Because if a planet is farther away (D2 > D1), it's colder (Te2 < Te1), which aligns with the given data.

Wait, the given ratio is Te1/Te2 ≈ 1.4. So, 1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So, squaring both sides: (1.4)^2 = D2/D1 → 1.96 = D2/D1. Therefore, D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 ≈2.3. So,

2.3 = sqrt( D3 / D2 )

Squaring both sides: 5.29 = D3/D2 → D3 = 5.29 * D2.

But D2 is 1.96 D1, so D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1 = let me compute 5.29 *1.96.

Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, but 5.29 *1.96 = ?

Wait, 5.29 ×1.96: let me compute.

5.29 × 2 =10.58, but since it's 1.96, which is 2 minus 0.04.

So, 5.29 ×1.96 = 5.29*(2 - 0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684.

So D3 is approximately 10.3684 * D1.

Wait, that's about 10.368 times D1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. So, what's the relation between orbital period and distance from the star?

Oh, Kepler's third law. The period P is proportional to the cube root of the distance from the star cubed, but depends on the mass of the star as well. The exact form is P² = (4π²/G M_star) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis (which is the same as D, the distance, since the orbits are circular).

So, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star.

Wait, but since all three planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all. So, the ratio of their periods would be based on the cube root of the ratio of their distances cubed.

More precisely, P1^2 / P3^2 = (D1^3) / (D3^3) )

Taking square roots: P1 / P3 = ( D1^3 / D3^3 )^(1/2) ) = (D1/D3)^(3/2 )

Wait, wait no. Let me think again.

Kepler's third law for planets around the same star:

P² ∝ a³ / M_star → since M_star is same, P² is proportional to a^3.

So, (P3 / P1)^2 = (D3^3 / D1^3 ) → P3 / P1 = (D3^3 / D1^3 )^(1/2) ) = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 )

But D3 is about 10.368 D1. So,

P3/P1 = (10.368)^(3/2 )

Wait, let me compute 10.368^(3/2).

First, sqrt(10.368) is approximately 3.22, because 3.2^2 is 10.24, 3.22^2 is 10.3684. Oh, that's exactly the D3 value I found earlier. So, sqrt(10.368) = 3.22.

So, 10.368^(3/2) is (sqrt(10.368)) * (10.368) ) → 3.22 * 10.368 ≈ let's compute that.

3.22 *10 =32.2, 3.22*0.368≈ 1.18496. So total ≈32.2 + 1.18496 = 33.38496.

So, P3 is approximately 33.38 times P1.

Wait, but the question is by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than Planet1. So, it's about 33.38, which is approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let's double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me go through the steps again:

1. The equilibrium temperature ratio is given as Te1/Te2 = 1.4.

2. Using Te ratio = sqrt(D2/D1), so D2 = (1.4)^2 D1 = 1.96 D1.

3. Te2/Te3 =2.3 → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3= (2.3)^2 D2 =5.29 * D2.

4. Substituting D2=1.96 D1 → D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 =10.3684 D1.

5. Using Kepler's law: P^2 ∝ D^3 → (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

6. sqrt(10.3684) is approx 3.22, so 10.3684^(3/2) = 3.22 * 10.3684 ≈33.38.

So yes, my calculation looks correct.

Wait, but what about the masses of the planets? The question gave mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2, and between Planet2 and Planet3. So, Planet1:Planet2 mass ratio is 1.15, and Planet2:Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet1 mass is 1.15 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3.

So, Planet1 is 1.15 * Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 * Planet3. So, Planet1 = 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3 → 1.15 *1.35 = 1.5525. So, Planet1 is about 1.55 times the mass of Planet3.

Wait, but does the mass of the planets affect their orbital period? I thought Kepler's law is about the mass of the star and the semi-major axis, not the planet's mass. So, since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, their mass can be neglected in Kepler's law. So, the period depends only on the star's mass and the semi-major axis. So, the planet masses don't affect the orbital period in this context. So, the given mass ratios are a red herring, and maybe included to test if the examinee falls into the trap of considering planet masses.

So, the correct approach is to ignore the mass ratios because they don't affect the orbital period in this scenario.

Thus, the factor is approximately 33.4, so option D.

Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits. The equilibrium temperature ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. Additionally, the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. The albedo for all three planets is 0.3. The goal is to determine by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Relationship**:  
   The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is proportional to \( \left(\frac{L}{D^2}\right)^{1/4} \), where \( L \) is the star's luminosity and \( D \) is the distance from the star. Since the albedo and \( L \) are constant for all planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends on the square root of the inverse of their distances:  
   \[
   \frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
   \]
   Using the given ratios:
   - For Planet1 and Planet2: \( \frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = 1.4 \), so \( \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \), meaning \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \).
   - For Planet2 and Planet3: \( \frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} = 2.3 \), so \( \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \), meaning \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \).

2. **Orbital Period and Distance Relationship**:  
   According to Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube root of the distance \( D \):  
   \[
   P^2 \propto D^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]
   Substituting \( D_3 = 10.368 D_1 \) (from \( D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \)), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.368)^{3/2}
   \]
   Breaking this down:
   - \( \sqrt{10.368} \approx 3.22 \), so \( (10.368)^{3/2} = 3.22 \times 10.368 \approx 33.38 \).

3. **Mass Ratios**:  
   The mass ratios between the planets (1.15 for Planet1 to Planet2, and 1.35 for Planet2 to Planet3) do not affect the orbital period, as Kepler's law depends only on the star's mass and the semi-major axis. Thus, these ratios are irrelevant to the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by the equation:

Te = T_star * ( ( L_star ) / (16 * pi^2 * sigma * D^2) )^(-1/4) 

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh wait, another way to write the equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, I think the formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( ( R_star ) / ( 2 D ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, perhaps another approach. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16 pi sigma D^2 (1-A)))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, D is the distance from the star, and A is albedo. Since all three planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends on their distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

Wait, but the star's luminosity isn't given differently for each planet, right? Because all three planets orbit the same star, so the L is the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the square root of (D) because L and (1-A) are the same.

Wait, let me get that straight. The formula for Te is (L * (1-A)/(16 pi sigma D^2))^(1/4). So, when taking the ratio of Te between two planets, say Planet1 and Planet2, the L and sigma and (1-A) are the same, so it's proportional to (1/D1^2)^(1/4) over (1/D2^2)^(1/4) which is D2/D1.

Wait, let me re-derive it. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 pi sigma D^2) ]^(1/4 )

So, when we take the ratio Te1/Te2:

Te1/Te2 = [ (L (1-A)/(16 pi sigma D1^2)) / (L (1-A)/(16 pi sigma D2^2)) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (D2^2) / (D1^2) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which is [ (D2/D1)^2 ]^(1/4 ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2) = sqrt(D2/D1)

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, because if D2 > D1, then Te2 would be lower than Te1, assuming all else equal. Because if a planet is farther away (D2 > D1), it's colder (Te2 < Te1), which aligns with the given data.

Wait, the given ratio is Te1/Te2 ≈ 1.4. So, 1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So, squaring both sides: (1.4)^2 = D2/D1 → 1.96 = D2/D1. Therefore, D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 ≈2.3. So,

2.3 = sqrt( D3 / D2 )

Squaring both sides: 5.29 = D3/D2 → D3 = 5.29 * D2.

But D2 is 1.96 D1, so D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1 = let me compute 5.29 *1.96.

Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, but 5.29 *1.96 = ?

Wait, 5.29 ×1.96: let me compute.

5.29 × 2 =10.58, but since it's 1.96, which is 2 minus 0.04.

So, 5.29 ×1.96 = 5.29*(2 - 0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684.

So D3 is approximately 10.3684 * D1.

Wait, that's about 10.368 times D1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. So, what's the relation between orbital period and distance from the star?

Oh, Kepler's third law. The period P is proportional to the cube root of the distance from the star cubed, but depends on the mass of the star as well. The exact form is P² = (4π²/G M_star) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis (which is the same as D, the distance, since the orbits are circular).

So, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star.

Wait, but since all three planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all. So, the ratio of their periods would be based on the cube root of the ratio of their distances cubed.

More precisely, P1^2 / P3^2 = (D1^3) / (D3^3) )

Taking square roots: P1 / P3 = ( D1^3 / D3^3 )^(1/2) ) = (D1/D3)^(3/2 )

Wait, wait no. Let me think again.

Kepler's third law for planets around the same star:

P² ∝ a³ / M_star → since M_star is same, P² is proportional to a^3.

So, (P3 / P1)^2 = (D3^3 / D1^3 ) → P3 / P1 = (D3^3 / D1^3 )^(1/2) ) = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 )

But D3 is about 10.368 D1. So,

P3/P1 = (10.368)^(3/2 )

Wait, let me compute 10.368^(3/2).

First, sqrt(10.368) is approximately 3.22, because 3.2^2 is 10.24, 3.22^2 is 10.3684. Oh, that's exactly the D3 value I found earlier. So, sqrt(10.368) = 3.22.

So, 10.368^(3/2) is (sqrt(10.368)) * (10.368) ) → 3.22 * 10.368 ≈ let's compute that.

3.22 *10 =32.2, 3.22*0.368≈ 1.18496. So total ≈32.2 + 1.18496 = 33.38496.

So, P3 is approximately 33.38 times P1.

Wait, but the question is by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than Planet1. So, it's about 33.38, which is approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let's double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me go through the steps again:

1. The equilibrium temperature ratio is given as Te1/Te2 = 1.4.

2. Using Te ratio = sqrt(D2/D1), so D2 = (1.4)^2 D1 = 1.96 D1.

3. Te2/Te3 =2.3 → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3= (2.3)^2 D2 =5.29 * D2.

4. Substituting D2=1.96 D1 → D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 =10.3684 D1.

5. Using Kepler's law: P^2 ∝ D^3 → (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

6. sqrt(10.3684) is approx 3.22, so 10.3684^(3/2) = 3.22 * 10.3684 ≈33.38.

So yes, my calculation looks correct.

Wait, but what about the masses of the planets? The question gave mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2, and between Planet2 and Planet3. So, Planet1:Planet2 mass ratio is 1.15, and Planet2:Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet1 mass is 1.15 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3.

So, Planet1 is 1.15 * Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 * Planet3. So, Planet1 = 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3 → 1.15 *1.35 = 1.5525. So, Planet1 is about 1.55 times the mass of Planet3.

Wait, but does the mass of the planets affect their orbital period? I thought Kepler's law is about the mass of the star and the semi-major axis, not the planet's mass.
