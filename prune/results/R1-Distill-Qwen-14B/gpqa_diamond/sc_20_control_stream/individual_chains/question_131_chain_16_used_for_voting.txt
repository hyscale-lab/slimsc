Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that when dicarboxylic acids lose water, they form cyclic anhydrides. The structure probably has two carboxylic acid groups connected by a cis double bond, so the dehydration would form a five-membered cyclic anhydride, right? Because five-membered rings are more stable.

Next, the anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's pretty deshielded, so maybe an aromatic proton? Wait, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid, which doesn't have aromatic rings. Oh, wait, maybe the cis-alkene became a cyclic structure. Or perhaps the anhydride has some conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to the anhydride. Wait, 7 ppm is typical for either aromatic protons or maybe an alpha proton next to an electron-withdrawing group, like in an enone or something.

Looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The 137 ppm is likely a carbon with some double bond character. Maybe a carbon adjacent to an oxygen or part of a double bond. The 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl carbon. So the anhydride has a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. Let me think about the structure. For example, something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH would form a cyclic anhydride when dehydrated, but that's trans. Wait, the starting material is cis-alkene. So maybe the structure is more like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond, so HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right because that's a single bond. Wait, no, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, so perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't the case. Wait, no. Maybe the structure is such that the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them. Like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the middle two CH2 becoming a double bond. Oh wait, that's not possible because that would make a double bond between the two CH2 groups, but that would be a trans configuration if they are on adjacent carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the central CH2 groups as a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2, which would be a trans configuration. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the alkene is between the two COOH groups. So, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the middle CH2's are a double bond. Wait, that can't happen because that would require four carbons. Oh, wait, perhaps the starting material is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the central two CH2s as a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, making the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, which would make it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but that's not possible because that would make a double bond in the middle. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a four-carbon diacid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not with a double bond. So maybe the actual structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a cis double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, which would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the middle two CH2 being a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the structure is something like HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. But that would have a cis double bond. Wait, no, because in that case, the two COOH groups would be on either end of the double bond. So, for a cis-diacid, it would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with the double bond in the middle. So the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that would make it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH as a diacid, but with a double bond, so the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle. No, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the middle two carbons are connected by a double bond. So, the starting material is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the middle is a double bond, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, which would make it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but that's not possible because that would be a single bond. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should focus on the anhydride structure.

The anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. That's a singlet, so maybe equivalent protons. So perhaps the anhydride has a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are connected via a double bond. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride formed from a diacid. The cyclic anhydride would have an oxygen bridge. Maybe the structure is a five-membered ring: O=C-O-C-O=C-O, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a maleic anhydride structure. Wait, maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride derived from maleic acid, which is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. So maleic anhydride has a structure with two double bonds, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is likely a proton environment that's equivalent on both sides of the ring. For example, in maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are equivalent, so they would show as a single peak. But wait, in maleic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with a double bond, and I think the protons on that double bond are deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm, maybe as a doublet. But in this question, the 1H NMR has a single peak, so maybe the protons are equivalent, such as in a symmetrical position. So perhaps the cyclic anhydride is such that the double bond is in a symmetric position, leading to equivalent protons.

Wait, but in the 13C NMR, there are two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is a carbonyl carbon (like an anhydride or ketone), and 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So maybe the anhydride has a structure where there's a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure that incorporates the double bond. So when the diacid is dehydrated, the double bond becomes part of the cyclic anhydride. So maybe the structure looks like a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond. So, perhaps it's something like an anhydride where the two carbons adjacent to the oxygen bridge are double-bonded, making a ring with a double bond.

Moving on, this anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, and the tetramethyl substitution would be at positions 1,2,3,4. So, the structure would be cyclopentadiene with methyl groups at all four positions? Or maybe it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which would be a fully substituted cyclopentadiene. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, a five-membered ring with two double bonds? Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, but that's not possible because that would make two adjacent double bonds, which isn't allowed. So perhaps it's a five-membered ring with a single double bond between 1-2 and 3-4, but that's not possible because that's allene, which is less stable. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopentadiene with a single double bond, but that would be 1,3-cyclopentadiene, a five-membered ring with a single double bond between carbons 1-2 and 3-4? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a 1,3-diene, like a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, but that would require rings with more than five carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

But the key point is that 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene, perhaps with substituents that make it more reactive. The reaction is between the anhydride and this diene. So the reaction is probably a Diels-Alder reaction, where the anhydride acts as a dienophile and the diene as the diene. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile and the diene.

So the products would be adducts of the anhydride and the diene. Since the diene is tetramethyl-substituted, the Diels-Alder adduct would have substituents from both the dienophile (anhydride) and the diene.

The problem states that two products are formed: major and minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formulas. The anhydride would have a certain formula, and the diene would contribute the rest.

Wait, the anhydride would come from a diacid. Let's say the diacid is HOOC-R-COOH, where R is a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride, which would have the formula O=C-O-R-O-C=O, perhaps. But more accurately, the formula would be (RCO)₂O. So if the diacid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H, dehydration would produce an anhydride with the formula (CH₂CH₂)₂O₂C, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, which upon dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride with the formula (CH₂)₂O₂C. But that doesn't account for a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact structure, so perhaps I should move forward. The product of the Diels-Alder reaction would add the diene (four substituents) and the dienophile (the anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups). So the adduct would have a six-membered ring, with substituents from both reactants.

Now, the next part is about the NOESY NMR. The major product has a cross-peak in its NOESY spectrum, while the minor does not. NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons, not through bonds. So if two protons are close in space (like on adjacent carbons or in a ring), they can show a cross-peak. The presence of a cross-peak suggests that those protons are near each other in the molecule.

In the major product, there's a cross-peak between two specific resonances. The options are about what these two resonances are.

Looking at the options, all involve singlets or doublets, and shifts in specific regions.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. 1 ppm is likely methyl protons, perhaps attached to something bulky. The doublet at 1.5 could be a CH2 or CH group adjacent to another group.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. 1.7 is also methyl or perhaps isopropyl, and 3.5 ppm is more like CH2 next to oxygen or something.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So two sets of methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Hmm. The question is about which two resonances are connected by a cross-peak in the major product. Since it's a Diels-Alder adduct, the structure would have a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride. Anhydrides typically have two carbonyl groups. When they react in a Diels-Alder, they form a six-membered ring with two ketone groups or ester groups, but in this case, it's an anhydride, so perhaps it forms a bridged structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder forms a bicyclic structure. But I'm not sure.

The minor product is likely a byproduct or a different regioisomer. But the major product is the more substituted or more stable adduct.

Now, considering the NMR shifts: the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY suggests that two protons are close in space. So perhaps one is on a methyl group and the other is on a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Or maybe two methyl groups are in close proximity.

Looking at the options, the major product's cross-peak connects a 6H singlet (probably methyl groups) and another proton group. If the 6H singlet is at ~1 ppm, that's typical for CH3 groups attached to something bulky or deshielded. The doublet at ~1.5 ppm would be a proton next to a CH2 or perhaps part of a ring.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. So methyl groups and a proton nearby. Maybe in the major product, the methyl groups from the diene are near a proton on the bridgehead of the adduct.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H singlet at 3.5 could be an oxygen-bearing CH2, maybe an OCH2 group. The 6H singlet at 1.7 could be a set of methyl groups attached to something else, like the bridgehead.

Option C: Two singlets, both methyl groups. Maybe in a structure where the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons but in a ring, making them close in space.

Option D: A doublet and a singlet. The doublet at 1.5 could be a CH2 adjacent to a CH, and the singlet at 3.5 could be an OCH2 group.

Wait, the NOESY cross-peak would connect two protons that are close in space. So which option makes sense?

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene and dienophile are positioned opposite each other (end groups). The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which would have four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentadiene. So when it reacts, the substituents would be on adjacent carbons in the adduct.

In the major product, perhaps a pair of protons that are on adjacent carbons in the ring would have a cross-peak. For example, two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, or a methyl and a CH2 group.

Wait, but the options involve different groupings. Let me think about the structure again. The dienophile is the anhydride, which upon Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring with two ester groups or an anhydride bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the adduct is a bicyclic structure, such as bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, with substituents from the dienophile.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the structure of the products. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. When it undergoes Diels-Alder with the anhydride, the endo rule would suggest that the more substituted product is the major one. The endo transition state would place the leaving group (the anhydride) closer to the diene's substituents.

So the adduct would have the substituents from the diene (four methyl groups) and the substituents from the anhydride (probably two carbonyl groups) in the endo position.

Now, in the product, the substituents would be arranged such that the methyl groups from the diene are adjacent to the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

Looking at the NMR shifts, the 1H NMR of the major product would have certain signals. The cross-peak in the NOESY would connect two protons that are spatially close, maybe on adjacent carbons.

Option B suggests a 6H singlet (maybe two sets of methyl groups) and a 2H singlet. But wait, 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an OCH2 group. If that's the case, perhaps the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen are deshielded and appear as a singlet. But how would a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm interact? Maybe the methyl groups are close to the OCH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 group is near a set of methyl groups, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Wait, the two products have the same molecular formula, so the difference is in the structure. The major product is probably the endo adduct, which would have the substituents closer to each other.

In the major product, the NOESY cross-peak connects a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. Or perhaps it's a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet.

Wait, looking again: the options are A, B, C, D. The question says which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak.

The cross-peak is between the 6H singlet and a 2H singlet in option B, or a 6H and a 1H in option A, etc.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene are in positions 1 and 4 of the cyclopentadiene, and upon reaction, these would be at specific positions in the six-membered ring.

If the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, then the adduct would have four methyl groups attached to the ring. The anhydride part would contribute two carbonyl groups, perhaps as ketones or ester groups.

In the major product, the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride would be positioned trans to each other, leading to certain proton shifts.

Wait, perhaps the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY is between a methyl group and a bridgehead proton. For example, a methyl group attached to a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between two methyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the options suggest different groupings. Let me think about the 1H NMR shifts.

Methyl groups at 1 ppm are typical for CH3 attached to something like an oxygen atom or another carbon. A doublet at 1.5 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or perhaps a CH group.

Wait, for example, if the adduct has a structure where a CH2 is next to a CH group, the CH's proton would be a doublet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But in option D, the 1H is a doublet at 1.5 and 2H singlet at 3.5.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group and a proton from an oxygen-bearing CH2 group, like OCH2.

In option B, 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 1.7 ppm is likely CH3 groups, and 3.5 ppm would be OCH2.

So the cross-peak would be between these two groups if they are spatially close. For example, in the six-membered ring, the OCH2 group is adjacent to a carbon attached to methyl groups. So the CH2O would be near the CH3 groups, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm is two sets of methyl groups, such as two methyl groups on adjacent carbons. Then, the OCH2 would be next to them, so the protons in OCH2 would be near the methyl groups, leading to a cross-peak.

In that case, the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (maybe two sets of methyl groups) and the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (OCH2) would show a cross-peak.

So looking at the options, option B seems plausible.

Alternatively, option C is two singlets, both of which are 6H. That could mean two sets of three methyl groups, maybe attached to adjacent carbons. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a cross-peak.

So, putting it all together, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY suggests spatial proximity between a 6H singlet (probably methyl groups) and a 2H singlet (maybe an OCH2 group). Therefore, the correct option is B: a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form a cyclic anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The major product shows a cross-peak in its NOESY spectrum, while the minor product does not. The task is to identify which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene likely forms a cyclic anhydride upon dehydration. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating equivalent protons, possibly from a double bond in a symmetric environment. The ¹³C NMR spectrum reveals two peaks at 137 ppm (likely a carbon adjacent to a double bond) and 165 ppm (a carbonyl carbon).

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride acts as a dienophile, and the 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene acts as a diene. The reaction forms a six-membered ring, with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The major product is likely the endo product, where substituents are positioned closer due to the endo rule.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The NOESY spectrum detects spatial proximity between protons. In the major product, the cross-peak indicates that two groups are close in space. The options describe various proton environments, and the cross-peak must connect two resonances that are spatially close in the product structure.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This suggests a methyl group near a CH proton, but the spatial proximity required for a cross-peak is less likely.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely an OCH₂ group). This is plausible, as the methyl groups from the diene could be spatially close to the OCH₂ group from the anhydride in the adduct.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two sets of methyl groups, but the cross-peak requires spatial proximity, which is less likely for two singlets.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This suggests a CH proton near an OCH₂ group, but the spatial proximity required for a cross-peak is less likely compared to Option B.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum is most consistent with a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (OCH₂ group). These groups are spatially close in the Diels-Alder adduct, making **Option B** the correct answer.
