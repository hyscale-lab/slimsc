Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The task is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. They've given me some spectroscopic data: IR and 1H NMR. I remember that IR tells us about functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure and environment of protons.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong intensity. Those are broad peaks, probably from N-H or O-H stretching. But wait, what's the difference between them? O-H is usually broader and around 3200-3600, while N-H can be a bit lower but still in that range. But looking at the options, maybe it's an amide or something with an amine group.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a key peak. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb around there. So possible functional groups could be ester, amide, or maybe a ketone, but with the formula, probably an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with three protons. That's likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe an ethyl group. Like in an ethyl ester or ethyl ether. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet with two protons. Maybe an amine group (-NH2), but in the options, I don't see any with two NH groups. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Wait, but the integration is 2H, so maybe a methylene next to an oxygen. But the broadness makes me think of NH, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group in an ester or ether.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet with two protons. Quartet suggests splitting into four, so probably next to a CH3. Like an ethyl group. So maybe this is an OCH2CH3 group. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, so that's the CH3 connected to the OCH2. So perhaps it's an ethyl ester group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each with two protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para substitution, you get two sets of doublets. So the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, the compound has an ethyl group (from the triplet and quartet), an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions, and a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1).

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The substituents would be at meta, but our NMR shows para substitution. So maybe not.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This would have a formamide group (CONH2) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The formamide would have a CONH2 group, which would show a peak around 1720 cm-1 in IR. But the NMR would have the ethoxy group, and the aromatic would be at para. But the NMR also shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which for formamide could be the NH2. But formamide has two NH protons, which might show up as a broad peak. But in the options, the NMR doesn’t show anything else for NH, but wait, the integration for the 4.0 ppm is 2H, so maybe that's from something else.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group in the para position. The NMR would have a triplet from the CH2CH2 group, but wait, the data has a triplet at 1.20 (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 (2H), which is more like an ethyl group. Propionate would have a longer chain. Also, the amine group (NH2) would show up in the NMR as a broad peak, but the integration here is 2H for the 4.0 ppm, which may not fit.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid with ethanol. So the benzoate ester would have the carbonyl at 1720 (which matches the IR). The ethyl group would show up as triplet (CH3) at ~1.2 and quartet (OCH2) at ~4.5. The amine group would be NH2, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, but in ethyl benzoate, the OCH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no, the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet coupled with the CH3, which is the triplet. So that fits the NMR data: 1.20 (t,3H) and 4.5 (q,2H) for the ethyl ester.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm in NMR is a broad singlet. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amine would be NH2. That would show up as a broad peak in the NMR, but where? Usually, amines can be broad, but in this case, the NMR shows 2H at 4.0. Hmm.

Wait, maybe that 4.0 ppm isn't the amine. Because the amine would be in the aromatic region, but wait, amines typically absorb around 1-5 ppm, but it depends on the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not an NH2 but another group.

Wait, looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the benzoate ester would have the ester group, which is OCH2CH3. The NMR shows 4.5 ppm (q,2H) which is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The 1.20 (t,3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group.

Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, para-substituted. That fits the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks. But what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? Oh, wait, perhaps I was wrong about the 4.0. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the NH2 group would be attached to the benzene ring. The NH2 would have protons, but in the NMR, they might not show up because they're exchanging with the solvent, or maybe they're broad.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, but then the amino group would have two protons. However, in the NMR, the 4.0 is 2H, so maybe it's not the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an -OCH2- group, but where? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another option is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH2) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The IR carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. The ethoxy group would give the triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be the NH2 group, but formamide's NH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, broad. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not visible here because it's a broad peak or perhaps it's split.

Wait, but the 4.0 ppm in the NMR is a broad singlet (bs) of 2H. If the compound is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the formamide has a CONH2 group. The NH2 would have two protons, but their chemical shift can vary. Maybe it's at around 4.0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is in a different position.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

In this case, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3
attached to a benzene ring with NH2 in the para position.

The NMR would have:

- OCH2CH3: 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.5 (q, 2H)
- The aromatic protons: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 (2H each)
- The NH2 group: maybe a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but where exactly?

Wait, the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) doesn't fit the ethoxy, because that's at 4.5. So where could that be?

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is the NH group, but in this case, it's an amine, which is a secondary amine if it's attached to the ring. Wait, no, it's a primary amine in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate because the amino group is attached to the ring, which is attached to the ester. So the amine would be NH2.

But in the NMR, the 4.0 is 2H, which doesn't match NH2 (which would be 2H, but maybe as a broad peak, but in this data, it's a singlet). Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is something else.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t,3H) → CH3 of ethyl
4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → ?
4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → OCH2 of ethyl ester
7.0 and 8.0 ppm → aromatic

So the only other group is the amino group. But where's the NH2 in the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the amino group. But if the amino group is not deprotonated, it would exchange rapidly, leading to a broad peak. However, in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet (2H). So that makes sense if it's the NH2 group.

But wait, the amino group protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, depending on the environment. But in the case of an aromatic amine, they can be deshielded and appear higher. For example, aniline's NH is around 4-5 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But the integration is 2H, which fits. So that would make sense.

But wait, the NMR shows 4.0 as a singlet, which is a bit strange for NH2, which usually splits into a singlet only if there's no coupling, but NH2 is usually a broad peak. But in the data, it's a broad singlet, so that could fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is not the NH2. Let me think about other options.

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

That would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene with NH2 in para. So the ethyl group would be in the propionate. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for a CH2CH2 group. It shows a triplet at 1.20 (3H) and quartet at 4.5 (2H), which is more like an ethyl group. So that doesn't fit, unless it's ethyl propionate, but the formula doesn't seem to match. Wait, the formula for option C is C9H11NO2: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C8H9NO2 (benzene + NH2 + propionate, which is C3H5O2). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with NH2 substitution, it's C7H7NO2? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe that's not the right path.

So going back. Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure would have:

- OEt (ethyl ester) → triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5
- Benzoate ring with NH2 at para → aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0
- NH2 protons → perhaps the 4.0 ppm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows another peak at 4.0, which is a broad singlet (2H). If the NH2 is at 4.0, that would fit. But in the data, the 4.0 is 2H, which matches the NH2.

But wait, ethyl ester's OCH2 is at 4.5, so that's separate.

Another thought: the IR has peaks at 3420 and 3325. Those could be N-H stretches. Amides and amines show peaks in that region. So if it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amine would have N-H stretches, which fit the IR data. The 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl, which makes sense.

So putting it all together, the structure would have an ethyl ester, a para-substituted benzene with NH2, and the NMR would have the ethyl groups and the aromatic protons. The 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is a broad singlet.

But wait, the 4.0 is 2H. NH2 has two protons, so that fits.

So looking at the options again:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

That would give the correct NMR and IR data.

Another option is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

In this case, the structure is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to formamide (CONH2). The IR would show the carbonyl (1720), and the ethoxy groups. The NMR would have the ethoxy triplet and quartet, and the aromatic doublets. The CONH2 would have NH2 protons, which might appear as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 is a singlet, which could be the NH2? Hmm, but formamide's NH2 would usually be a broad peak, maybe around 8-10 ppm? I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is at a lower ppm. But I think ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits better.

Another thought: the integration of the NMR. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are each 2H, which suggests a para substitution. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, one in each para position. So if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are OEt and NH2 in the para positions.

Wait, no, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be OEt at the ester oxygen, which is attached to the ring. The NH2 is on the benzene ring. So the substituents are OEt (ester) and NH2, which are in the para positions. That would make the aromatic protons split into two doublets, as observed.

So the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given spectroscopic data:

### IR Data:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad peaks in this range suggest the presence of N-H or O-H groups.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak indicating a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Data:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) in an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely from an -NH₂ group or another -CH₂ group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a CH₃ group, as seen in an ethyl ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - This compound has an ethoxy group at the meta position and an amide group. However, the NMR data shows a para-substituted aromatic ring, which does not match the structure of this compound.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - This compound has a formamide group (CONH₂) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The ethoxy group would produce the triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm, and the para-substituted aromatic ring would produce the doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. However, the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) does not align with the expected NH₂ group of the formamide.  
   **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - This compound has a propionate group (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) attached to a 4-aminophenyl group. The NMR data does not show the expected triplet and quartet for the propionate group, as the observed data matches an ethyl group rather than a longer chain.  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - This compound has an ethyl ester group (OCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (-NH₂) attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - The **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** correspond to the ethyl ester group.  
   - The **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons of the para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - The **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the NH₂ group, which is consistent with the broad singlet observed in the NMR.  
   - The IR data also aligns with the ester carbonyl group (1720 cm⁻¹) and the N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹).  
   **Matches all data.**

### Conclusion:
The compound that matches the given spectroscopic data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The task is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. They've given me some spectroscopic data: IR and 1H NMR. I remember that IR tells us about functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure and environment of protons.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong intensity. Those are broad peaks, probably from N-H or O-H stretching. But wait, what's the difference between them? O-H is usually broader and around 3200-3600, while N-H can be a bit lower but still in that range. But looking at the options, maybe it's an amide or something with an amine group.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a key peak. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb around there. So possible functional groups could be ester, amide, or maybe a ketone, but with the formula, probably an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with three protons. That's likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe an ethyl group. Like in an ethyl ester or ethyl ether. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet with two protons. Maybe an amine group (-NH2), but in the options, I don't see any with two NH groups. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Wait, but the integration is 2H, so maybe a methylene next to an oxygen. But the broadness makes me think of NH, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group in an ester or ether.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet with two protons. Quartet suggests splitting into four, so probably next to a CH3. Like an ethyl group. So maybe this is an OCH2CH3 group. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, so that's the CH3 connected to the OCH2. So perhaps it's an ethyl ester group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each with two protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para substitution, you get two sets of doublets. So the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, the compound has an ethyl group (from the triplet and quartet), an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions, and a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1).

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The substituents would be at meta, but our NMR shows para substitution. So maybe not.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This would have a formamide group (CONH2) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The formamide would have a CONH2 group, which would show a peak around 1720 cm-1 in IR. But the NMR would have the ethoxy group, and the aromatic would be at para. But the NMR also shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which for formamide could be the NH2. But formamide has two NH protons, which might show up as a broad peak. But in the options, the NMR doesn’t show anything else for NH, but wait, the integration for the 4.0 ppm is 2H, so maybe that's from something else.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group in the para position. The NMR would have a triplet from the CH2CH2 group, but wait, the data has a triplet at 1.20 (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 (2H), which is more like an ethyl group. Propionate would have a longer chain. Also, the amine group (NH2) would show up in the NMR as a broad peak, but the integration here is 2H for the 4.0 ppm, which may not fit.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid with ethanol. So the benzoate ester would have the carbonyl at 1720 (which matches the IR). The ethyl group would show up as triplet (CH3) at ~1.2 and quartet (OCH2) at ~4.5. The amine group would be NH2, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, but in ethyl benzoate, the OCH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no, the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet coupled with the CH3, which is the triplet. So that fits the NMR data: 1.20 (t,3H) and 4.5 (q,2H) for the ethyl ester.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm in NMR is a broad singlet. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amine would be NH2. That would show up as a broad peak in the NMR, but where? Usually, amines can be broad, but in this case, the NMR shows 2H at 4.0. Hmm.

Wait, maybe that 4.0 ppm isn't the amine. Because the amine would be in the aromatic region, but wait, amines typically absorb around 1-5 ppm, but it depends on the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not an NH2 but another group.

Wait, looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the benzoate ester would have the ester group, which is OCH2CH3. The NMR shows 4.5 ppm (q,2H) which is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The 1.20 (t,3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group.

Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, para-substituted. That fits the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks. But what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? Oh, wait, perhaps I was wrong about the 4.0. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the NH2 group would be attached to the benzene ring. The NH2 would have protons, but in the NMR, they might not show up because they're exchanging with the solvent, or maybe they're broad.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, but then the amino group would have two protons. However, in the NMR, the 4.0 is 2H, so maybe it's not the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an -OCH2- group, but where? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another option is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH2) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The IR carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. The ethoxy group would give the triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be the NH2 group, but formamide's NH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, broad. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not visible here because it's a broad peak or perhaps it's split.

Wait, but the 4.0 ppm in the NMR is a broad singlet (bs) of 2H. If the compound is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the formamide has a CONH2 group. The NH2 would have two protons, but their chemical shift can vary. Maybe it's at around 4.0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is in a different position.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

In this case, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3
attached to a benzene ring with NH2 in the para position.

The NMR would have:

- OCH2CH3: 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.5 (q, 2H)
- The aromatic protons: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 (2H each)
- The NH2 group: maybe a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but where exactly?

Wait, the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) doesn't fit the ethoxy, because that's at 4.5. So where could that be?

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is the NH group, but in this case, it's an amine, which is a secondary amine if it's attached to the ring. Wait, no, it's a primary amine in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate because the amino group is attached to the ring, which is attached to the ester. So the amine would be NH2.

But in the NMR, the 4.0 is 2H, which doesn't match NH2 (which would be 2H, but maybe as a broad peak, but in this data, it's a singlet). Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is something else.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t,3H) → CH3 of ethyl
4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → ?
4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → OCH2 of ethyl ester
7.0 and 8.0 ppm → aromatic

So the only other group is the amino group. But where's the NH2 in the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the amino group. But if the amino group is not deprotonated, it would exchange rapidly, leading to a broad peak. However, in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet (2H). So that makes sense if it's the NH2 group.

But wait, the amino group protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, depending on the environment. But in the case of an aromatic amine, they can be deshielded and appear higher. For example, aniline's NH is around 4-5 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But the integration is 2H, which fits. So that would make sense.

But wait, the NMR shows 4.0 as a singlet, which is a bit strange for NH2, which usually splits into a singlet only if there's no coupling, but NH2 is usually a broad peak. But in the data, it's a broad singlet, so that could fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is not the NH2. Let me think about other options.

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

That would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene with NH2 in para. So the ethyl group would be in the propionate. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for a CH2CH2 group. It shows a triplet at 1.20 (3H) and quartet at 4.5 (2H), which is more like an ethyl group. So that doesn't fit, unless it's ethyl propionate, but the formula doesn't seem to match. Wait, the formula for option C is C9H11NO2: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C8H9NO2 (benzene + NH2 + propionate, which is C3H5O2). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with NH2 substitution, it's C7H7NO2? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe that's not the right path.

So going back. Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure would have:

- OEt (ethyl ester) → triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5
- Benzoate ring with NH2 at para → aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0
- NH2 protons → perhaps the 4.0 ppm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows another peak at 4.0, which is a broad singlet (2H). If the NH2 is at 4.0, that would fit. But in the data, the 4.0 is 2H, which matches the NH2.

But wait, ethyl ester's OCH2 is at 4.5, so that's separate.

Another thought: the IR has peaks at 3420 and 3325. Those could be N-H stretches. Amides and amines show peaks in that region. So if it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amine would have N-H stretches, which fit the IR data. The 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl, which makes sense.

So putting it all together, the structure would have an ethyl ester, a para-substituted benzene with NH2, and the NMR would have the ethyl groups and the aromatic protons. The 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is a broad singlet.

But wait, the 4.0 is 2H. NH2 has two protons, so that fits.

So looking at the options again:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

That would give the correct NMR and IR data.

Another option is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

In this case, the structure is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to formamide (CONH2). The IR would show the carbonyl (1720), and the ethoxy groups. The NMR would have the ethoxy triplet and quartet, and the aromatic doublets. The CONH2 would have NH2 protons, which might appear as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 is a singlet, which could be the NH2? Hmm, but formamide's NH2 would usually be a broad peak, maybe around 8-10 ppm? I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is at a lower ppm. But I think ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits better.

Another thought: the integration of the NMR. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are each 2H, which suggests a para substitution. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, one in each para position. So if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are OEt and NH2 in the para positions.

Wait, no, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be OEt at the ester oxygen, which is attached to the ring. The NH2 is on the benzene ring. So the substituents are OEt (ester) and NH2, which are in the para positions. That would make the aromatic protons split into two doublets, as observed.

So the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given spectroscopic data:

### IR Data:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad peaks in this range suggest the presence of N-H or O-H groups.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak indicating a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Data:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) in an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely from an -NH₂ group or another -CH₂ group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a CH₃ group, as seen in an ethyl ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - This compound has an ethoxy group at the meta position and an amide group. However, the NMR data shows a para-substituted aromatic ring, which does not match the structure of this compound.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - This compound has a formamide group (CONH₂) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The ethoxy group would produce the triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm, and the para-substituted aromatic ring would produce the doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. However, the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) does not align with the expected NH₂ group of the formamide.  
   **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - This compound has a propionate group (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) attached to a 4-aminophenyl group. The NMR data does not show the expected triplet and quartet for the propionate group, as the observed data matches an ethyl group rather than a longer chain.  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - This compound has an ethyl ester group (OCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (-NH₂) attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - The **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** correspond to the ethyl ester group.  
   - The **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons of the para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - The **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the NH₂ group, which is consistent with the broad singlet observed in the NMR.  
   - The IR data also aligns with the ester carbonyl group (1720 cm⁻¹) and the N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹).  
   **Matches all data.**

### Conclusion:
The compound that matches the given spectroscopic data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**
