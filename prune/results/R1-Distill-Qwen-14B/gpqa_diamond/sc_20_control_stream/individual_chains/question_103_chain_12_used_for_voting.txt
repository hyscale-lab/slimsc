Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is an acetophenone derivative, so the main substituents here are a bromine and a nitro group attached to the benzene ring in specific positions, and an acetyl group (from the ketone) as well.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Let me think about the directing effects of these groups. Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine (as a substituent in ortho/para positions) would also be a meta director if it's attached in a certain way. Wait, but wait, bromine is an ortho/para director when it's attached to the ring, right? Because it's an electron-withdrawing group but via an activating or deactivating effect? Oh wait, no. Wait, bromine is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the electronegativity of Br), but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, I think I might have confused that. Let me think again: substituents that are strongly electron-withdrawing (like nitro groups) are meta directors. But substituents that are weakly deactivating (like halogens) are ortho/para directors because they can donate electrons through resonance. Wait, no, halogens have a higher electronegativity, making them deactivating, but their lone pairs can still participate in resonance, so they are ortho/para directors. So, a nitro group is meta-directing, and a bromine substituent is ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we have bromo and nitro substituents in the 3 and 5 positions. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let me number it: let's say the acetyl group is at position 1. Then the nitro group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl?), and bromo at position 5 (which is meta to position 2, perhaps). Hmm, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is the main substituent, and I need to add nitro and bromine in certain positions relative to it. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, so the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So, position 1 is where the ketone is attached, then the nitro is at position 5, and bromo at position 3. That would make sense if the substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to each other.

But to achieve that, the order of substitution is important because each new substituent will direct the next substitution. So we have to plan the order in which we add the groups.

I think the key here is the order of adding the nitro and bromine groups, as well as the acetyl group.

Wait, the starting material is benzene, so all substituents need to be added step by step.

Let me think about the possible reaction steps.

First, I might consider whether to add the nitro group first. Nitration is typically done under strongly acidic conditions, with H2SO4 and HNO3. Alternatively, adding the bromine first, which can be done via electrophilic substitution using Br2 with FeBr3 as a catalyst.

So, if I start with benzene, perhaps I add the nitro group first. Then, the nitro group is a meta director, so the next substituent would go into a meta position. Then, perhaps add bromine, which would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, but then adding the acetyl group (like from an acetylation via Friedel-Crafts) would require the ring to be activated. Because Friedel-Crafts acetylation (using CH3COCl and AlCl3) works on aromatic rings that are activated towards electrophilic substitution. However, nitro groups are deactivating, so adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, so after nitration, the ring would be deactivated, making it hard to perform Friedel-Crafts.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl group is added first. But in Friedel-Crafts, you can't have strong deactivating groups already present. So perhaps the order is: acetylate benzene to make acetophenone, then add nitro and bromine.

Wait, but the target has both nitro and bromine, so their positions must be considered.

Wait, let's try to plan the synthesis.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (I'll call it that). So, the substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to number it such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group at position 1.

Wait, acetophenone is benzene with a ketone group at position 1. So, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So, on the ring, the acetyl is at position 1. Then, the next substituent would be at position 3 (meta to the ketone), and then another substituent at position 5, which is meta to position 2, which I'm not sure about. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the numbering.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituents as being on the same ring. So, the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at position 3, and bromo at position 5. So, each substituent is meta to the next.

So, if I add the acetyl group first, then when I add the nitro group, it would be directed to the meta position of the acetyl (position 3). Then, when adding bromine, it would be directed by the nitro group, which is at position 3. Wait, but the nitro group is a meta director, so adding bromine after nitro would place it in which position?

Wait, let me think: when benzene has a nitro group, the next substituent can be added in the meta position relative to the nitro. But wait, after adding the nitro group, the ring is deactivating, so the next substituent (like bromine) would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, but if the first substituent is acetyl (activating), then adding the nitro group would be in the meta position relative to the acetyl (position 3). Then, adding bromine would be directed by the nitro group (which is a meta director), so the bromine would go into the position meta to the nitro group. But where is that?

So, if the acetyl is at position 1, nitro is at position 3 (meta to position 1), then the bromine would be at position 5 (meta to position 3). Because the nitro is at position 3, so the meta positions are 6 and position 5? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, position 1 is the acetyl. Position 3 is next to that, so position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4. The meta positions for position 3 would be positions 1, 5, and 6? Wait, no. Wait, the positions are numbered in a way that each position is adjacent to the next. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is next to 1 and 3. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4, and so on. So, the meta positions for position 3 would be position 6 (if starting from 3, going two steps clockwise would be 5, then 6?), or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the para and meta positions relative to the substituent. Let me imagine the ring:

1: Acetyl

2: H (ortho to 1)

3: H (meta to 1)

4: H (para to 1, but that's position 4)

Wait, no, position 4 is para to position 1.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to sketch a benzene ring with substituents. But since I can't do that, I'll have to visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of adding substituents matters in terms of the directing effect.

So, the plan is:

1. Acetylate benzene to make acetophenone. Acetyl is activating, so next substituents will be added in the ortho/para positions relative to the acetyl.

But wait, the target has nitro and bromine substituents in positions 3 and 5. So, if the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at 3, and bromo at 5, let's see:

After acetylation, the next step is to add nitro group. Since acetyl is an activating group (directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions), the nitro group would go to either ortho (position 2 or 6) or para (position 4). Wait, but nitration is typically a meta director, but wait, no, nitro is a meta director in the ring. Wait, no. Wait, the nitro group is a substituent that is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. So, the acetyl group is an activating group (it's an electron-donating group via resonance), so it's ortho/para directing. So, when I nitrate acetophenone, the nitro group should enter at either ortho (position 2 or 6), or para (position 4) to the acetyl group.

But in the target molecule, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl group. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the acetyl group directs incoming groups to ortho and para, the nitro group would be added in position 2, 4, or 6, not in position 3.

Wait, so that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the acetyl group.

Wait, but if nitro group is added first, the ring is deactivating. Then, adding the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult, because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So that's not good.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the acetyl group, but that doesn't seem possible because nitro deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts unlikely.

Wait, but there's another possibility: perhaps adding the bromine and nitro groups in a way that their positions can be achieved with the directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nitro group and bromine are added in such a way that their positions are determined by the existing substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetyl group is added last. So, the steps would be: add bromine, then nitro, then acetyl. But that seems tricky because adding acetyl after nitro would not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetyl, then nitro, then bromine. But as I thought earlier, the nitro group would be directed to ortho or para of the acetyl, not meta.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me think again about the substituents and their directing effects.

The acetyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

The nitro group is a deactivating, meta director.

Bromine is a deactivating (due to its electronegativity) but ortho/para director.

So, the order in which these are added will determine where each substituent ends up.

Suppose I add the acetyl group first. Then, the ring is activated, so the next substituent (say nitro) would go into ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl. Let's say nitro goes into the para position (position 4). Then, perhaps adding bromine would be directed by the nitro group. Since nitro is meta director, bromine would go into position 1 (but that's where the acetyl is), which is not possible, or position 7, which doesn't exist. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added in the ortho position (position 2).

Wait, but then when adding bromine, which is directed by nitro (as a meta director), where would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group in the para position (position 4) relative to the acetyl (position 1). Then, the nitro group is at 4. Then, when adding bromine, which is an ortho/para director, but the ring is deactivating because of nitro. Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivating, so adding bromine via electrophilic substitution with FeBr3 might not be feasible. Oh, right, because nitro is a strong deactivating group, so the ring would be less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the substituents in the correct order that allows for the desired positions. Let's see: the target has nitro at position 3 and bromo at 5 relative to the acetyl at 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then bromine, then acetyl. But again, adding acetyl after nitro is problematic because the ring is deactivating.

Wait, but perhaps the acetyl group is added using a different approach. I remember that sometimes, when a ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work, but maybe if the substitution is in a position that's activated by another group.

Alternatively, maybe another approach is needed. Let's think of the possible reaction sequences in the options.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of reagents. Let me look for the correct order.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acetylation), ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4, etc.

Wait, but if we acetylate first (i), then the ring is activated. Then, adding Br2 with FeBr3 (ii) would add bromine in the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl group. Then, nitrating (iii) would add nitro group according to the current substituents.

Wait, let me think:

After step i: benzene becomes acetophenone (position 1).

Step ii: bromination (FeBr3) adds Br in ortho (2) or para (4) positions.

Step iii: nitration adds nitro group, which would be directed by the acetyl and the bromine substituents.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong meta director, so it would likely go into a position that's meta to the acetyl and perhaps ortho/para to the bromine.

But I'm not sure if this would lead to the desired positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration comes before bromination. Let's see.

After acetylation, if I nitrate, the acetyl directs the nitro group to ortho or para. Then, bromination would be directed by both the acetyl and nitro groups.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added after the nitro and bromine.

But that brings me back to the problem of adding the acetyl after deactivating groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to nitrate first, then brominate, then acetylate. But that would require the acetylation to occur on a ring that already has nitro and bromine substituents. But as I thought before, the ring is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Wait, but perhaps after nitration and bromination, the ring still has some activating groups, or perhaps the acetylation can be done under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different order:

Add bromine first. Then, nitrate. Then, acetylate. Let's see:

Benzene + Br2/FeBr3: adds Br in ortho or para (let's say para for simplicity, position 4).

Then nitrate: the nitro group is added, directed by Br (which is ortho/para director). So, nitro could go into position 3 (ortho to Br at 4 and meta to position 1? No, wait, if Br is at 4, then ortho positions are 3 and 5. So nitro could go into position 3 or 5.

Wait, but position 3 is meta to the position where the acetyl would be added. Hmm, maybe that's the way.

Then, after nitro is added, we need to add acetylation. But the ring now has Br at 4 and nitro at, say, 3. The acetyl would be added where? Well, the ring is deactivating because of nitro, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is added before nitration and bromination, but the problem is that nitration would then be directed by the acetyl.

Wait, perhaps if I add the nitro group in a position that doesn't interfere with the acetyl group's position.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to acetylate, then add bromine, and then nitrate in a position that is meta to the acetyl and ortho to the bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate. Let's see:

1. Acetylate benzene to acetophenone.

2. Nitrate: nitro group goes into ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) positions relative to the acetyl.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is meta to the acetyl. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of reagents. Let's examine them.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation) → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → adds Br in ortho or para to acetyl.

Then, iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration) → nitro group is added, directed by the acetyl group (ortho/para). So, nitro would go into ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) positions.

Then, iv) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step? Wait, Fe/HCl is used in some reactions, perhaps for removing nitro groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is for something else. Wait, perhaps it's a way to introduce a substituent via a different mechanism.

Wait, but the target has both nitro and bromine. So, perhaps after adding Br, then nitration, but that might not lead to the correct positions.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: adds nitro group, directed by Br (which is ortho/para). So, nitro could be in ortho or para to Br.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring now has Br (deactivating) and nitro (also deactivating), so acetylation via Friedel-Crafts might not work.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. But benzene is not very reactive towards nitration without a catalyst. Wait, HNO3 and H2SO4 are the nitrating agents, but under what conditions? Oh, wait, nitrating benzene requires a catalyst, like H2SO4 as a catalyst. So, benzene can be nitrated to produce nitrobenzene.

But then, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so the next step would be difficult. The next step is ii) Fe/HCl: maybe this is for something else, perhaps reduction? Fe/HCl is used in some reductions, like in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but in acidic conditions, maybe it's for a different purpose.

Wait, but if I have nitrobenzene, and then I use Fe/HCl, perhaps it's a way to introduce a substituent via some kind of coupling reaction. I'm not too sure about this.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring is deactivated, so perhaps this won't work unless there's another activating group.

Hmm, perhaps not the best option.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe some reaction, perhaps reduction of nitro to amine? But I'm not sure.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's usually for aromatic amines. If the previous step was a reduction, perhaps it's for that.

iv) H3PO2 → this is a reagent used for controlled reduction, perhaps in the Birch reduction? Or maybe for removing protecting groups.

But I'm not sure how this sequence would build the substituents correctly.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options are making immediate sense, but perhaps I should think more carefully.

Another approach: the target molecule has a nitro group at position 3 and bromo at position 5 relative to the acetyl at position 1.

So, in the ring, the substituents are positioned as follows:

1: Acetyl

3: Br

5: NO2

So, the nitro is at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl (position 1), and the bromo is at position 3, which is meta to the nitro (position 5). Or vice versa.

So, to get the nitro at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl, we need to have a substituent that directs the nitration to that position. But wait, the acetyl group is ortho/para directing, so it's not possible to get the nitro to go meta to the acetyl unless the acetyl is added after the nitro, but that requires the ring to be activated for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group was added first, but that would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts impossible. So, this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at para (position 4) to acetyl.

3. Nitrate → nitro group added where?

Wait, after adding Br at position 4, the nitro group would be directed by both the acetyl and the Br. The acetyl is ortho/para, and Br is ortho/para. So, the nitro group could end up at position 3 (which is ortho to Br at 4 and meta to acetyl at 1). That would fit the target structure.

So, let's think:

After step 1: Acetyl at 1.

Step 2: Br at 4 (para to acetyl).

Step 3: Nitration. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (4). The nitro group can be added in a position that is ortho/para to Br and ortho/para to acetyl. The possible positions are 2,3,5,6.

But the acetyl is at 1, and the Br is at 4.

The nitro group would be directed by Br (ortho/para) → possible positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Br at 4).

But the acetyl is at 1, and the nitro group would be added in position 3, which is meta to acetyl, which is not directed by acetyl but by Br.

So, that would place nitro at position 3, which is meta to acetyl. But wait, the acetyl is ortho/para directing, and the Br is ortho/para directing. So, the nitro group would go into a position that is ortho/para to Br and ortho/para to acetyl.

Wait, but position 3 is meta to acetyl (1) and ortho to Br (4), so the nitro will go into position 3.

Then, the substituents would be:

1: Acetyl

3: Nitro

4: Br

Wait, but the target has Br at position 5. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the positions. Let me try again.

If the acetyl is at position 1, and Br is added at position 4 (para), then during nitration, the incoming nitro group can go to position 3 (which is ortho to Br at 4) or position 5 (also ortho to Br at 4). Let's say it goes to position 5. Then, the substituents would be:

1: Acetyl

4: Br

5: Nitro

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added in a different position.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation, the bromine is added in the ortho position to the acetyl (position 2). Then, nitration would occur, and the nitro group would be directed by Br. Let's see:

After step 1: Acetyl at 1.

Step 2: Br at 2 (ortho to acetyl).

Then, step 3: nitration. The nitro group would be directed by Br (ortho/para). So, possible positions are 1 (acetyl, already occupied), 3 (meta to Br at 2), and 4 (para to Br at 2). So, nitro could go to position 3 or 4.

If it goes to position 3, then substituents are:

1: Acetyl

2: Br

3: Nitro

But the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if the nitro is added to position 4, then the substituents would be:

1: Acetyl

2: Br

4: Nitro.

Again, not matching the target.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then bromine, then acetyl. But as I thought earlier, adding acetyl after nitro is problematic.

Wait, maybe I should think about the meta directors. For the nitro group to end up at position 5, perhaps it's directed by another group. Let me think, perhaps the acetyl is added after nitration and bromination.

Wait, but without the acetyl being the first step, adding it later requires the ring to be activated.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Brominate → Br added, but the ring is deactivated, so this might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added first, then nitrate, then acetylate.

Wait, if I add bromine first, benzene becomes bromobenzene. Then, nitrate: the nitro group would be added in ortho or para to Br. Let's say it's para (position 4 if Br is at 1). Then, trying to acetylate the ring. But the ring has a nitro group (deactivating) and Br (deactivating, but ortho/para director). So, acetylation via Friedel-Crafts might not proceed.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the acetyl group first, then nitrate, then brominate, but that didn't seem to work earlier. Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group after bromine and acetyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe looking at the options again would help.

Option B: Steps are Br2/FeBr3, then nitration, then acetylation.

So:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrated → nitro group added ortho/para to Br.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

But after adding Br and nitro, the ring is deactivated, so acetylation might not work. So, this sequence probably won't work.

Option C: HNO3 first, then Fe/HCl, then acetylation, then Br2...

Wait, let's think:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro group to amine? But that would introduce an amine, which is a strong activating group. But then, acetylation would add an acetyl group in the ortho/para positions of the amine.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the correct order: to get the substituents in the correct positions, probably the acetyl group is added first (since it's activating), then the nitro group in meta to the acetyl, then the bromine added where?

Wait, but the acetyl group is ortho/para director, so the nitro group would go to ortho or para, not meta. So, perhaps this isn't possible unless another director is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let me think: acetyl first, then bromine, then nitro. Let's see:

1. Acetyl → position 1.

2. Bromine → added in ortho (position 2) or para (4).

Let’s say it’s added para, position 4.

Then, nitration: the nitro group is directed by the bromine (ortho/para), so it could go to position 3 or 5 relative to Br (position 4). So, position 3 or 5.

But position 3 is meta to acetyl (position 1). So, if nitro is added at position 3, that would be meta to the acetyl. So, that's what we need.

So, steps would be: acetylation, bromination (para), nitration.

So, the order would be i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration.

Now, looking at the options, which option has this sequence?

Looking at option C: steps are HNO3, Fe/HCl, acetylation, Br2...

No, that's not the right order.

Option B: bromination first, then nitration, then acetylation.

No.

Option A: acetylation, bromination, nitration, etc.

Wait, looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → ?

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

But in the sequence I thought of, after acetylation and bromination, nitration would add the nitro group. So, steps i, ii, iii.

But in option A, step iii is nitration, but then after that, there are more steps, including another nitration (v), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps option A is not the right choice.

Looking at the target molecule, it has only one nitro group and one bromine, so perhaps the options that have multiple nitrations or substitutions are incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct path is option B or C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br added in para position to acetyl (position 4).

3. Nitrate → nitro group added in position 3 (ortho to Br, meta to acetyl).

Which would give the substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 4 (Br). But the target has Br at position 5, not 4.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added in the ortho position to the acetyl (position 2). Then, nitration would occur.

After acetylation (position 1), bromine added at position 2. Then, nitration would be directed by Br (ortho/para), so nitro could go to position 1 (acetyl), position 3, or position 6.

But position 1 is already taken by acetyl, so nitro would go to position 3 or 6.

If nitro is at position 3, which is meta to acetyl, that's correct. So, substituents would be at 1 (acetyl), 2 (Br), 3 (nitro). But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added in position 6 (para to position 2, but I'm getting confused with the numbering).

Alternatively, perhaps the order is acetylation, nitration, bromination. Let's see:

1. Acetyl → position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to acetyl). But wait, acetyl is ortho/para director, so nitro can't be added in meta position.

Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps this isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add bromine after acetylation and nitration. So:

1. Acetylation → position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro added in para position (4).

3. Bromination → Br is added in position 5 (ortho to nitro at 4).

So, substituents at 1 (acetyl), 4 (nitro), 5 (Br).

But the target has nitro at 5, Br at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in position 5, and Br in 3.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions are numbered 1 (acetyl), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If I add the nitro group at position 5 (meta to acetyl at 1), the nitro is directed by the acetyl. But wait, acetyl is ortho/para, so nitro can't be added in the meta position. So, how can we get nitro at position 5?

Ah, maybe the acetyl is added after the nitro and bromine. But that would require the ring to be activated, which isn't possible if it has nitro and bromine.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Brominate benzene → Br at position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro added at position 3 (ortho to Br).

3. Acetylate → acetyl added at position 5 (meta to nitro and para to Br? Not sure.)

Wait, but after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acetylation via Friedel-Crafts might not work.

Hmm, this is really challenging.

Perhaps looking at the options again, I should think which one would give the correct substituent order.

Looking at option B:

Steps: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Nitro can go to ortho or para of Br. Let's say ortho, position 2.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, this option is probably not correct.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → ?? Maybe reducing nitro to amine.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate. With amine being activating, acetylation can occur. Then, iv) Br2 → brominate, which would be directed by the acetyl and amine groups.

Wait, perhaps:

After step i: nitro group at position 1.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (NH2 at 1). Now, the ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para director).

Step iii: acetylate → CH3COCl/AlCl3. The acetyl would add to ortho or para of NH2. Let's say position 3.

Step iv: Br2 → adds Br, directed by acetyl (position 3) and NH2 (position 1). Wait, but the acetyl is now at 3, and the NH2 is at 1.

Bromine would be added ortho or para to the acetyl (position 3). So, possible positions 2,4,5.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetylation, the Br is added in position 5 (meta to acetyl at 3? No, acetyl is activating so Br would go ortho/para. So, position 2,4, or 6.

Hmm, this isn't matching the target.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a reduction step.

v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again.

But this seems to involve multiple steps that might not lead to the target.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to process each option step by step.

Let's take option B:

Option B steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene (Br at position 1).

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since Br is at 1, nitro group can go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assuming it goes to position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring has Br (deactivating) and nitro (strong deactivating). So, Friedel-Crafts won't work, making this step impossible.

So, option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene (position 1).

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to NH2 (now at position 1).

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. Since the ring now has NH2 (activating, ortho/para), acetyl adds to position 3 or 5 (ortho/para to NH2 at 1).

Let's say it adds to position 3.

iv) Br2 → bromination. The ring now has NH2 at 1 and acetyl at 3. The acetyl is activating (ortho/para). So, Br can go to position 2 (ortho to 3), position 4 (para to 3), position 5 (meta to 3, but that's not directed by acetyl which is ortho/para).

But wait, bromine is an ortho/para director, so Br would go into positions ortho or para to the acetyl (position 3), which are 2,4,6.

But the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added at position 5, but I'm getting confused.

Option A:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone (position 1).

ii) Br2 → adds Br in position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assume Br at 4.

iii) HNO3 → nitro group added. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (4). The nitro group is directed by Br (ortho/para) → possible positions 3 and 5.

If nitro is added to position 5, then substituents are:

1: Acetyl

4: Br

5: Nitro.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, this isn't matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation and bromination, nitration adds the nitro group in position 3 (ortho to Br at 4). So, substituents are:

1: Acetyl

4: Br

3: Nitro.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

So, this isn't correct.

I'm not finding a sequence that fits. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro group after the bromine. Let me think:

1. Acetylation → position 1.

2. Bromination → position 3 (ortho to acetyl at 1? No, because bromine would be added ortho or para to acetyl. So, position 2 or 4.

Wait, if bromine is added in position 2 (ortho to acetyl), then:

3. Nitration → directed by Br (ortho/para), so nitro can go to position 1 (acetyl, occupied), 3 (meta to Br), or 6 (para to Br).

Wait, position 3 is meta to Br at 2, so nitro would go to position 3.

So, substituents are:

1: Acetyl

2: Br

3: Nitro.

Which matches the target only if the target has Br at 2 and nitro at 3. But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetylation and bromination, the nitro group is added in position 5, which is para to Br at position 4.

So, let's say:

1. Acetylation → position 1.

2. Bromination → position 4 (para).

3. Nitration → position 5 (para to Br at 4, which is possible).

So, substituents are 1 (acetyl), 4 (Br), 5 (nitro).

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate → position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro group added in position 3 (meta to acetyl, but wait, acetyl is ortho/para director, so this can't happen).

No, that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added via a different route. Wait, could the nitro group be added via some kind of coupling reaction rather than electrophilic substitution? Probably not, as the options don't suggest that.

I'm stuck, but looking back at the options, perhaps option B is the correct one despite my earlier doubts.

Wait, what if after adding Br and nitro, the ring is nitrated again in a different position? But the target only has one nitro group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Acetylate → acetanilide (acetyl at position 2, since amine is at 1).

4. Brominate → Br added in position 4 (para to acetyl).

5. Nitrate → but this would add another nitro group, which isn't desired.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

I'm not making progress. Perhaps I need to think of which option's sequence would result in the substituents being in the correct positions.

Looking again at the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

So, substituents are:

1: Acetyl

3: Br

5: Nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the nitro group in position 3, then bromine in position 5, then acetyl in position 1. But how?

But the ring would need to have activating groups for Friedel-Crafts acetylation to occur.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Brominate benzene → position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro added in position 3 (ortho to Br).

3. Acetylate → acetyl added in position 5 (meta to nitro at 3, but nitro is meta director, so this would require the acetyl to be added in meta position, which is not possible with Friedel-Crafts because nitro is deactivating.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added via a different method, but I can't think of any.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: in the target, the nitro and bromine are meta to each other. Because position 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) are two positions apart, which are meta to each other.

So, to get both substituents in the correct positions relative to each other, perhaps they are added in a way that each is meta to the other.

So, the first substituent is added, then the second is added in its meta position.

But considering the directing effects.

Let me think: if I first add the nitro group, then bromine would be added in meta to nitro, which would be position 5 if nitro is at 3.

But the acetyl would have to be added in a position that is activated, but the ring is deactivated by nitro and bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate → position 1.

2. Brominate → position 3 (meta to acetyl, but bromine is ortho/para director, so this can't happen. So, bromine can't be added in meta position to acetyl, which is an ortho/para director.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Brominate → position 1.

2. Acetylate → position 3 (meta to Br, but acetylation requires ortho/para to activating groups. So, acetyl can't be added in meta position. So, this is impossible.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the earlier reasoning, the acetyl must be added first, then bromine, then nitro. Looking at the options, option A has acetylation first, then bromination, then nitration.

But in option A, after nitration, there are more steps, including another nitration and others, which might not be necessary. But perhaps the correct sequence is A.

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group, so the option should have nitration only once.

Looking again at option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration: nitro added ortho or para.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation.

But as I thought earlier, acetylation won't work because the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but this requires that the acetylation step somehow works, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the acetylation is done before nitration and bromination, but this brings us back to the earlier problem that the nitro group is directed to ortho/para of acetyl.

But the target has nitro at 5, which is meta to acetyl at 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate → position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro added in position 4 (para to acetyl).

3. Brominate → Br added in position 5 (para to nitro at 4).

So, substituents at 1 (acetyl), 4 (nitro), 5 (Br).

But the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in numbering the positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring again.

If acetyl is at position 1, and nitro is at position 3 (meta to acetyl), then bromine must be added in position 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3).

But how can nitro be added in position 3 if acetyl is directing to ortho and para.

Wait, perhaps there's a way for the nitro group to be added to a position that is meta to acetyl but ortho to another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after bromine.

But I'm not making progress.

In the end, I think the correct sequence is to acetylate first, then nitrate, then brominate. But the options don't directly reflect that.

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is the only one that adds bromine first, then nitrate, then acetylate. But Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitrating and brominating.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps option B is correct because after bromination and nitration, the acetylation is done under different conditions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Considering the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the key challenge lies in the sequence of reactions to achieve the correct positioning of the substituents: an acetyl group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The directing effects of the substituents and the activation/deactivation of the aromatic ring must be carefully considered.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) adds the acetyl group to benzene, creating acetophenone. The acetyl group is an ortho/para-directing, activating group.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine to the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group, which is directed by the acetyl group (ortho/para) and the bromine (ortho/para).
4. Subsequent steps (iv–vii) include additional reactions that are unnecessary for the target molecule, as the target has only one nitro and one bromine group.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the correct positioning of the substituents, as the nitro group would not end up at position 5 relative to the acetyl group.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine to benzene, creating bromobenzene. Bromine is an ortho/para-directing, deactivating group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group to the ortho or para positions relative to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) attempts to add the acetyl group. However, the ring is deactivated due to the presence of the nitro and bromine groups, making Friedel-Crafts acetylation unlikely to proceed.

**Conclusion**: This sequence is not viable because the acetylation step would fail on a deactivated ring.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group to benzene, creating nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-directing, deactivating group.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine group, which is an ortho/para-directing, activating group.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) adds the acetyl group to the ortho or para positions relative to the amine group.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine, directed by the acetyl group (ortho/para).
5. Subsequent steps (v–vii) include additional reactions that are unnecessary for the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the correct positioning of the substituents, as the bromine and nitro groups would not end up in the desired positions.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group to benzene, creating nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-directing, deactivating group.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine group, which is an ortho/para-directing, activating group.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and reduction (H₃PO₂) are typically used for introducing substituents via diazonium salts, but this sequence does not align with the target molecule.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine, but the sequence does not ensure the correct positioning of the substituents.
5. **Step v**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) attempts to add the acetyl group, but the ring is deactivated due to the presence of the nitro and bromine groups.

**Conclusion**: This sequence is not viable because the acetylation step would fail on a deactivated ring.

---

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, **Option B** is the most plausible, as it follows a logical sequence of bromination, nitration, and acetylation. However, the acetylation step in Option B is problematic due to the deactivated nature of the ring after nitration and bromination. Despite this limitation, Option B aligns most closely with the desired sequence of reactions.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is an acetophenone derivative, so the main substituents here are a bromine and a nitro group attached to the benzene ring in specific positions, and an acetyl group (from the ketone) as well.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Let me think about the directing effects of these groups. Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine (as a substituent in ortho/para positions) would also be a meta director if it's attached in a certain way. Wait, but wait, bromine is an ortho/para director when it's attached to the ring, right? Because it's an electron-withdrawing group but via an activating or deactivating effect? Oh wait, no. Wait, bromine is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the electronegativity of Br), but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, I think I might have confused that. Let me think again: substituents that are strongly electron-withdrawing (like nitro groups) are meta directors. But substituents that are weakly deactivating (like halogens) are ortho/para directors because they can donate electrons through resonance. Wait, no, halogens have a higher electronegativity, making them deactivating, but their lone pairs can still participate in resonance, so they are ortho/para directors. So, a nitro group is meta-directing, and a bromine substituent is ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we have bromo and nitro substituents in the 3 and 5 positions. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let me number it: let's say the acetyl group is at position 1. Then the nitro group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl?), and bromo at position 5 (which is meta to position 2, perhaps). Hmm, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is the main substituent, and I need to add nitro and bromine in certain positions relative to it. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, so the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So, position 1 is where the ketone is attached, then the nitro is at position 5, and bromo at position 3. That would make sense if the substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to each other.

But to achieve that, the order of substitution is important because each new substituent will direct the next substitution. So we have to plan the order in which we add the groups.

I think the key here is the order of adding the nitro and bromine groups, as well as the acetyl group.

Wait, the starting material is benzene, so all substituents need to be added step by step.

Let me think about the possible reaction steps.

First, I might consider whether to add the nitro group first. Nitration is typically done under strongly acidic conditions, with H2SO4 and HNO3. Alternatively, adding the bromine first, which can be done via electrophilic substitution using Br2 with FeBr3 as a catalyst.

So, if I start with benzene, perhaps I add the nitro group first. Then, the nitro group is a meta director, so the next substituent would go into a meta position. Then, perhaps add bromine, which would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, but then adding the acetyl group (like from an acetylation via Friedel-Crafts) would require the ring to be activated. Because Friedel-Crafts acetylation (using CH3COCl and AlCl3) works on aromatic rings that are activated towards electrophilic substitution. However, nitro groups are deactivating, so adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, so after nitration, the ring would be deactivated, making it hard to perform Friedel-Crafts.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl group is added first. But in Friedel-Crafts, you can't have strong deactivating groups already present. So perhaps the order is: acetylate benzene to make acetophenone, then add nitro and bromine.

Wait, but the target has both nitro and bromine, so their positions must be considered.

Wait, let's try to plan the synthesis.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (I'll call it that). So, the substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to number it such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group at position 1.

Wait, acetophenone is benzene with a ketone group at position 1. So, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So, on the ring, the acetyl is at position 1. Then, the next substituent would be at position 3 (meta to the ketone), and then another substituent at position 5, which is meta to position 2, which I'm not sure about. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the numbering.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituents as being on the same ring. So, the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at position 3, and bromo at position 5. So, each substituent is meta to the next.

So, if I add the acetyl group first, then when I add the nitro group, it would be directed to the meta position of the acetyl (position 3). Then, when adding bromine, it would be directed by the nitro group, which is at position 3. Wait, but the nitro group is a meta director, so adding bromine after nitro would place it in which position?

Wait, let me think: when benzene has a nitro group, the next substituent can be added in the meta position relative to the nitro. But wait, after adding the nitro group, the ring is deactivating, so the next substituent (like bromine) would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, but if the first substituent is acetyl (activating), then adding the nitro group would be in the meta position relative to the acetyl (position 3). Then, adding bromine would be directed by the nitro group (which is a meta director), so the bromine would go into the position meta to the nitro group. But where is that?

So, if the acetyl is at position 1, nitro is at position 3 (meta to position 1), then the bromine would be at position 5 (meta to position 3). Because the nitro is at position 3, so the meta positions are 6 and position 5? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, position 1 is the acetyl. Position 3 is next to that, so position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4. The meta positions for position 3 would be positions 1, 5, and 6? Wait, no. Wait, the positions are numbered in a way that each position is adjacent to the next. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is next to 1 and 3. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4, and so on. So, the meta positions for position 3 would be position 6 (if starting from 3, going two steps clockwise would be 5, then 6?), or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the para and meta positions relative to the substituent. Let me imagine the ring:

1: Acetyl

2: H (ortho to 1)

3: H (meta to 1)

4: H (para to 1, but that's position 4)

Wait, no, position 4 is para to position 1.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to sketch a benzene ring with substituents. But since I can't do that, I'll have to visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of adding substituents matters in terms of the directing effect.

So, the plan is:

1. Acetylate benzene to make acetophenone. Acetyl is activating, so next substituents will be added in the ortho/para positions relative to the acetyl.

But wait, the target has nitro and bromine substituents in positions 3 and 5. So, if the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at 3, and bromo at 5, let's see:

After acetylation, the next step is to add nitro group. Since acetyl is an activating group (directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions), the nitro group would go to either ortho (position 2 or 6) or para (position 4). Wait, but nitration is typically a meta director, but wait, no, nitro is a meta director in the ring. Wait, no. Wait, the nitro group is a substituent that is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. So, the acetyl group is an activating group (it's an electron-donating group via resonance), so it's ortho/para directing. So, when I nitrate acetophenone, the nitro group should enter at either ortho (position 2 or 6), or para (position 4) to the acetyl group.

But in the target molecule, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl group. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the acetyl group directs incoming groups to ortho and para, the nitro group would be added in position 2, 4, or 6, not in position 3.

Wait, so that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the acetyl group.

Wait, but if nitro group is added first, the ring is deactivating. Then, adding the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult, because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So that's not good.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the acetyl group, but that doesn't seem possible because nitro deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts unlikely.

Wait, but there's another possibility: perhaps adding the bromine and nitro groups in a way that their positions can be achieved with the directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nitro group and bromine are added in such a way that their positions are determined by the existing substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetyl group is added last. So, the steps would be: add bromine, then nitro, then acetyl. But that seems tricky because adding acetyl after nitro would not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetyl, then nitro, then bromine. But as I thought earlier, the nitro group would be directed to ortho or para of the acetyl, not meta.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me think again about the substituents and their directing effects.

The acetyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

The nitro group is a deactivating, meta director.

Bromine is a deactivating (due to its electronegativity) but ortho/para director.

So, the order in which these are added will determine where each substituent ends up.

Suppose I add the acetyl group first. Then, the ring is activated, so the next substituent (say nitro) would go into ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl. Let's say nitro goes into the para position (position 4). Then, perhaps adding bromine would be directed by the nitro group. Since nitro is meta director, bromine would go into position 1 (but that's where the acetyl is), which is not possible, or position 7, which doesn't exist. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added in the ortho position (position 2).

Wait, but then when adding bromine, which is directed by nitro (as a meta director), where would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group in the para position (position 4) relative to the acetyl (position 1). Then, the nitro group is at 4. Then, when adding bromine, which is an ortho/para director, but the ring is deactivating because of nitro. Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivating, so adding bromine via electrophilic substitution with FeBr3 might not be feasible. Oh, right, because nitro is a strong deactivating group, so the ring would be less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the substituents in the correct order that allows for the desired positions. Let's see: the target has nitro at position 3 and bromo at 5 relative to the acetyl at 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then bromine, then acetyl. But again, adding acetyl after nitro is problematic because the ring is deactivating.

Wait, but perhaps the acetyl group is added using a different approach. I remember that sometimes, when a ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work, but maybe if the substitution is in a position that's activated by another group.

Alternatively, maybe another approach is needed. Let's think of the possible reaction sequences in the options.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of reagents. Let me look for the correct order.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acetylation), ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4, etc.

Wait, but if we acetylate first (i), then the ring is activated. Then, adding Br2 with FeBr3 (ii) would add bromine in the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl group. Then, nitrating (iii) would add nitro group according to the current substituents.

Wait, let me think:

After step i: benzene becomes acetophenone (position 1).

Step ii: bromination (FeBr3) adds Br in ortho (2) or para (4) positions.

Step iii: nitration adds nitro group, which would be directed by the acetyl and the bromine substituents.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong meta director, so it would likely go into a position that's meta to the acetyl and perhaps ortho/para to the bromine.

But I'm not sure if this would lead to the desired positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration comes before bromination. Let's see.

After acetylation, if I nitrate, the acetyl directs the nitro group to ortho or para. Then, bromination would be directed by both the acetyl and nitro groups.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added after the nitro and bromine.

But that brings me back to the problem of adding the acetyl after deactivating groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to nitrate first, then brominate, then acetylate. But that would require the acetylation to occur on a ring that already has nitro and bromine substituents. But as I thought before, the ring is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Wait, but perhaps after nitration and bromination, the ring still has some activating groups, or perhaps the acetylation can be done under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different order:

Add bromine first. Then, nitrate. Then, acetylate. Let's see:

Benzene + Br2/FeBr3: adds Br in ortho or para (let's say para for simplicity, position 4).

Then nitrate: the nitro group is added, directed by Br (which is ortho/para director). So, nitro could go into position 3 (ortho to Br at 4 and meta to position 1? No, wait, if Br is at 4, then ortho positions are 3 and 5. So nitro could go into position 3 or 5.

Wait, but position 3 is meta to the position where the acetyl would be added. Hmm, maybe that's the way.

Then, after nitro is added, we need to add acetylation. But the ring now has Br at 4 and nitro at, say, 3. The acetyl would be added where? Well, the ring is deactivating because of nitro, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is added before nitration and bromination, but the problem is that nitration would then be directed by the acetyl.

Wait, perhaps if I add the nitro group in a position that doesn't interfere with the acetyl group's position.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to acetylate, then add bromine, and then nitrate in a position that is meta to the acetyl and ortho to the bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate. Let's see:

1. Acetylate benzene to acetophenone.

2. Nitrate: nitro group goes into ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) positions relative to the acetyl.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is meta to the acetyl. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of reagents. Let's examine them.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation) → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → adds Br in ortho or para to acetyl.

Then, iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration) → nitro group is added, directed by the acetyl group (ortho/para). So, nitro would go into ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) positions.

Then, iv) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step? Wait, Fe/HCl is used in some reactions, perhaps for removing nitro groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is for something else. Wait, perhaps it's a way to introduce a substituent via a different mechanism.

Wait, but the target has both nitro and bromine. So, perhaps after adding Br, then nitration, but that might not lead to the correct positions.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: adds nitro group, directed by Br (which is ortho/para). So, nitro could be in ortho or para to Br.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring now has Br (deactivating) and nitro (also deactivating), so acetylation via Friedel-Crafts might not work.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. But benzene is not very reactive towards nitration without a catalyst. Wait, HNO3 and H2SO4 are the nitrating agents, but under what conditions? Oh, wait, nitrating benzene requires a catalyst, like H2SO4 as a catalyst. So, benzene can be nitrated to produce nitrobenzene.

But then, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so the next step would be difficult. The next step is ii) Fe/HCl: maybe this is for something else, perhaps reduction? Fe/HCl is used in some reductions, like in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but in acidic conditions, maybe it's for a different purpose.

Wait, but if I have nitrobenzene, and then I use Fe/HCl, perhaps it's a way to introduce a substituent via some kind of coupling reaction. I'm not too sure about this.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring is deactivated, so perhaps this won't work unless there's another activating group.

Hmm, perhaps not the best option.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe some reaction, perhaps reduction of nitro to amine? But I'm not sure.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's usually for aromatic amines. If the previous step was a reduction, perhaps it's for that.

iv) H3PO2 → this is a reagent used for controlled reduction, perhaps in the Birch reduction? Or maybe for removing protecting groups.

But I'm not sure how this sequence would build the substituents correctly.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options are making immediate sense, but perhaps I should think more carefully.

Another approach: the target molecule has a nitro group at position 3 and bromo at position 5 relative to the acetyl at position 1.

So, in the ring, the substituents are positioned as follows:

1: Acetyl

3: Br

5: NO2

So, the nitro is at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl (position 1), and the bromo is at position 3, which is meta to the nitro (position 5). Or vice versa.

So, to get the nitro at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl, we need to have a substituent that directs the nitration to that position. But wait, the acetyl group is ortho/para directing, so it's not possible to get the nitro to go meta to the acetyl unless the acetyl is added after the nitro, but that requires the ring to be activated for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group was added first, but that would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts impossible. So, this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at para (position 4) to acetyl.

3. Nitrate → nitro group added where?

Wait, after adding Br at position 4, the nitro group would be directed by both the acetyl and the Br. The acetyl is ortho/para, and Br is ortho/para. So, the nitro group could end up at position 3 (which is ortho to Br at 4 and meta to acetyl at 1). That would fit the target structure.

So, let's think:

After step 1: Acetyl at 1.

Step 2: Br at 4 (para to acetyl).

Step 3: Nitration. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (4). The nitro group can be added in a position that is ortho/para to Br and ortho/para to acetyl. The possible positions are 2,3,5,6.

But the acetyl is at 1, and the Br is at 4.

The nitro group would be directed by Br (ortho/para) → possible positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Br at 4).

But the acetyl is at 1, and the nitro group would be added in position 3, which is meta to acetyl, which is not directed by acetyl but by Br.

So, that would place nitro at position 3, which is meta to acetyl. But wait, the acetyl is ortho/para directing, and the Br is ortho/para directing. So, the nitro group would go into a position that is ortho/para to Br and ortho/para to acetyl.

Wait, but position 3 is meta to acetyl (1) and ortho to Br (4), so the nitro will go into position 3.

Then, the substituents would be:

1: Acetyl

3: Nitro

4: Br

Wait, but the target has Br at position 5. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the positions. Let me try again.

If the acetyl is at position 1, and Br is added at position 4 (para), then during nitration, the incoming nitro group can go to position 3 (which is ortho to Br at 4) or position 5 (also ortho to Br at 4). Let's say it goes to position 5. Then, the substituents would be:

1: Acetyl

4: Br

5: Nitro

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added in a different position.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation, the bromine is added in the ortho position to the acetyl (position 2). Then, nitration would occur, and the nitro group would be directed by Br. Let's see:

After step 1: Acetyl at 1.

Step 2: Br at 2 (ortho to acetyl).

Then, step 3: nitration. The nitro group would be directed by Br (ortho/para). So, possible positions are 1 (acetyl, already occupied), 3 (meta to Br at 2), and 4 (para to Br at 2). So, nitro could go to position 3 or 4.

If it goes to position 3, then substituents are:

1: Acetyl

2: Br

3: Nitro

But the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if the nitro is added to position 4, then the substituents would be:

1: Acetyl

2: Br

4: Nitro.

Again, not matching the target.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then bromine, then acetyl. But as I thought earlier, adding acetyl after nitro is problematic.

Wait, maybe I should think about the meta directors. For the nitro group to end up at position 5, perhaps it's directed by another group. Let me think, perhaps the acetyl is added after nitration and bromination.

Wait, but without the acetyl being the first step, adding it later requires the ring to be activated.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Brominate → Br added, but the ring is deactivated, so this might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added first, then nitrate, then acetylate.

Wait, if I add bromine first, benzene becomes bromobenzene. Then, nitrate: the nitro group would be added in ortho or para to Br. Let's say it's para (position 4 if Br is at 1). Then, trying to acetylate the ring. But the ring has a nitro group (deactivating) and Br (deactivating, but ortho/para director). So, acetylation via Friedel-Crafts might not proceed.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the acetyl group first, then nitrate, then brominate, but that didn't seem to work earlier. Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group after bromine and acetyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe looking at the options again would help.

Option B: Steps are Br2/FeBr3, then nitration, then acetylation.

So:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrated → nitro group added ortho/para to Br.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

But after adding Br and nitro, the ring is deactivated, so acetylation might not work. So, this sequence probably won't work.

Option C: HNO3 first, then Fe/HCl, then acetylation, then Br2...

Wait, let's think:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro group to amine? But that would introduce an amine, which is a strong activating group. But then, acetylation would add an acetyl group in the ortho/para positions of the amine.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the correct order: to get the substituents in the correct positions, probably the acetyl group is added first (since it's activating), then the nitro group in meta to the acetyl, then the bromine added where?

Wait, but the acetyl group is ortho/para director, so the nitro group would go to ortho or para, not meta. So, perhaps this isn't possible unless another director is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let me think: acetyl first, then bromine, then nitro. Let's see:

1. Acetyl → position 1.

2. Bromine → added in ortho (position 2) or para (4).

Let’s say it’s added para, position 4.

Then, nitration: the nitro group is directed by the bromine (ortho/para), so it could go to position 3 or 5 relative to Br (position 4). So, position 3 or 5.

But position 3 is meta to acetyl (position 1). So, if nitro is added at position 3, that would be meta to the acetyl. So, that's what we need.

So, steps would be: acetylation, bromination (para), nitration.

So, the order would be i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration.

Now, looking at the options, which option has this sequence?

Looking at option C: steps are HNO3, Fe/HCl, acetylation, Br2...

No, that's not the right order.

Option B: bromination first, then nitration, then acetylation.

No.

Option A: acetylation, bromination, nitration, etc.

Wait, looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → ?

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

But in the sequence I thought of, after acetylation and bromination, nitration would add the nitro group. So, steps i, ii, iii.

But in option A, step iii is nitration, but then after that, there are more steps, including another nitration (v), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps option A is not the right choice.

Looking at the target molecule, it has only one nitro group and one bromine, so perhaps the options that have multiple nitrations or substitutions are incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct path is option B or C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br added in para position to acetyl (position 4).

3. Nitrate → nitro group added in position 3 (ortho to Br, meta to acetyl).

Which would give the substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 4 (Br). But the target has Br at position 5, not 4.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added in the ortho position to the acetyl (position 2). Then, nitration would occur.

After acetylation (position 1), bromine added at position 2. Then, nitration would be directed by Br (ortho/para), so nitro could go to position 1 (acetyl), position 3, or position 6.

But position 1 is already taken by acetyl, so nitro would go to position 3 or 6.

If nitro is at position 3, which is meta to acetyl, that's correct. So, substituents would be at 1 (acetyl), 2 (Br), 3 (nitro). But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added in position 6 (para to position 2, but I'm getting confused with the numbering).

Alternatively, perhaps the order is acetylation, nitration, bromination. Let's see:

1. Acetyl → position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to acetyl). But wait, acetyl is ortho/para director, so nitro can't be added in meta position.

Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps this isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add bromine after acetylation and nitration. So:

1. Acetylation → position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro added in para position (4).

3. Bromination → Br is added in position 5 (ortho to nitro at 4).

So, substituents at 1 (acetyl), 4 (nitro), 5 (Br).

But the target has nitro at 5, Br at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in position 5, and Br in 3.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions are numbered 1 (acetyl), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If I add the nitro group at position 5 (meta to acetyl at 1), the nitro is directed by the acetyl. But wait, acetyl is ortho/para, so nitro can't be added in the meta position. So, how can we get nitro at position 5?

Ah, maybe the acetyl is added after the nitro and bromine. But that would require the ring to be activated, which isn't possible if it has nitro and bromine.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Brominate benzene → Br at position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro added at position 3 (ortho to Br).

3. Acetylate → acetyl added at position 5 (meta to nitro and para to Br? Not sure.)

Wait, but after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acetylation via Friedel-Crafts might not work.

Hmm, this is really challenging.

Perhaps looking at the options again, I should think which one would give the correct substituent order.

Looking at option B:

Steps: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Nitro can go to ortho or para of Br. Let's say ortho, position 2.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, this option is probably not correct.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → ?? Maybe reducing nitro to amine.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate. With amine being activating, acetylation can occur. Then, iv) Br2 → brominate, which would be directed by the acetyl and amine groups.

Wait, perhaps:

After step i: nitro group at position 1.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (NH2 at 1). Now, the ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para director).

Step iii: acetylate → CH3COCl/AlCl3. The acetyl would add to ortho or para of NH2. Let's say position 3.

Step iv: Br2 → adds Br, directed by acetyl (position 3) and NH2 (position 1). Wait, but the acetyl is now at 3, and the NH2 is at 1.

Bromine would be added ortho or para to the acetyl (position 3). So, possible positions 2,4,5.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetylation, the Br is added in position 5 (meta to acetyl at 3? No, acetyl is activating so Br would go ortho/para. So, position 2,4, or 6.

Hmm, this isn't matching the target.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a reduction step.

v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again.

But this seems to involve multiple steps that might not lead to the target.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to process each option step by step.

Let's take option B:

Option B steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene (Br at position 1).

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since Br is at 1, nitro group can go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assuming it goes to position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But the ring has Br (deactivating) and nitro (strong deactivating). So, Friedel-Crafts won't work, making this step impossible.

So, option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene (position 1).

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to NH2 (now at position 1).

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. Since the ring now has NH2 (activating, ortho/para), acetyl adds to position 3 or 5 (ortho/para to NH2 at 1).

Let's say it adds to position 3.

iv) Br2 → bromination. The ring now has NH2 at 1 and acetyl at 3. The acetyl is activating (ortho/para). So, Br can go to position 2 (ortho to 3), position 4 (para to 3), position 5 (meta to 3, but that's not directed by acetyl which is ortho/para).

But wait, bromine is an ortho/para director, so Br would go into positions ortho or para to the acetyl (position 3), which are 2,4,6.

But the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added at position 5, but I'm getting confused.

Option A:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone (position 1).

ii) Br2 → adds Br in position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assume Br at 4.

iii) HNO3 → nitro group added. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (4). The nitro group is directed by Br (ortho/para) → possible positions 3 and 5.

If nitro is added to position 5, then substituents are:

1: Acetyl

4: Br

5: Nitro.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, this isn't matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation and bromination, nitration adds the nitro group in position 3 (ortho to Br at 4). So, substituents are:

1: Acetyl

4: Br

3: Nitro.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

So, this isn't correct.

I'm not finding a sequence that fits. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro group after the bromine. Let me think:

1. Acetylation → position 1.

2. Bromination → position 3 (ortho to acetyl at 1? No, because bromine would be added ortho or para to acetyl. So, position 2 or 4.

Wait, if bromine is added in position 2 (ortho to acetyl), then:

3. Nitration → directed by Br (ortho/para), so nitro can go to position 1 (acetyl, occupied), 3 (meta to Br), or 6 (para to Br).

Wait, position 3 is meta to Br at 2, so nitro would go to position 3.

So, substituents are:

1: Acetyl

2: Br

3: Nitro.

Which matches the target only if the target has Br at 2 and nitro at 3. But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetylation and bromination, the nitro group is added in position 5, which is para to Br at position 4.

So, let's say:

1. Acetylation → position 1.

2. Bromination → position 4 (para).

3. Nitration → position 5 (para to Br at 4, which is possible).

So, substituents are 1 (acetyl), 4 (Br), 5 (nitro).

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate → position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro group added in position 3 (meta to acetyl, but wait, acetyl is ortho/para director, so this can't happen).

No, that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added via a different route. Wait, could the nitro group be added via some kind of coupling reaction rather than electrophilic substitution? Probably not, as the options don't suggest that.

I'm stuck, but looking back at the options, perhaps option B is the correct one despite my earlier doubts.

Wait, what if after adding Br and nitro, the ring is nitrated again in a different position? But the target only has one nitro group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Acetylate → acetanilide (acetyl at position 2, since amine is at 1).

4. Brominate → Br added in position 4 (para to acetyl).

5. Nitrate → but this would add another nitro group, which isn't desired.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

I'm not making progress. Perhaps I need to think of which option's sequence would result in the substituents being in the correct positions.

Looking again at the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

So, substituents are:

1: Acetyl

3: Br

5: Nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the nitro group in position 3, then bromine in position 5, then acetyl in position 1. But how?

But the ring would need to have activating groups for Friedel-Crafts acetylation to occur.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Brominate benzene → position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro added in position 3 (ortho to Br).

3. Acetylate → acetyl added in position 5 (meta to nitro at 3, but nitro is meta director, so this would require the acetyl to be added in meta position, which is not possible with Friedel-Crafts because nitro is deactivating.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added via a different method, but I can't think of any.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: in the target, the nitro and bromine are meta to each other. Because position 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) are two positions apart, which are meta to each other.

So, to get both substituents in the correct positions relative to each other, perhaps they are added in a way that each is meta to the other.

So, the first substituent is added, then the second is added in its meta position.

But considering the directing effects.

Let me think: if I first add the nitro group, then bromine would be added in meta to nitro, which would be position 5 if nitro is at 3.

But the acetyl would have to be added in a position that is activated, but the ring is deactivated by nitro and bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate → position 1.

2. Brominate → position 3 (meta to acetyl, but bromine is ortho/para director, so this can't happen. So, bromine can't be added in meta position to acetyl, which is an ortho/para director.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Brominate → position 1.

2. Acetylate → position 3 (meta to Br, but acetylation requires ortho/para to activating groups. So, acetyl can't be added in meta position. So, this is impossible.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the earlier reasoning, the acetyl must be added first, then bromine, then nitro. Looking at the options, option A has acetylation first, then bromination, then nitration.

But in option A, after nitration, there are more steps, including another nitration and others, which might not be necessary. But perhaps the correct sequence is A.

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group, so the option should have nitration only once.

Looking again at option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration: nitro added ortho or para.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation.

But as I thought earlier, acetylation won't work because the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but this requires that the acetylation step somehow works, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the acetylation is done before nitration and bromination, but this brings us back to the earlier problem that the nitro group is directed to ortho/para of acetyl.

But the target has nitro at 5, which is meta to acetyl at 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate → position 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro added in position 4 (para to acetyl).

3. Brominate → Br added in position 5 (para to nitro at 4).

So, substituents at 1 (acetyl), 4 (nitro), 5 (Br).

But the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in numbering the positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring again.

If acetyl is at position 1, and nitro is at position 3 (meta to acetyl), then bromine must be added in position 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3).

But how can nitro be added in position 3 if acetyl is directing to ortho and para.

Wait, perhaps there's a way for the nitro group to be added to a position that is meta to acetyl but ortho to another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after bromine.

But I'm not making progress.

In the end, I think the correct sequence is to acetylate first, then nitrate, then brominate. But the options don't directly reflect that.

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is the only one that adds bromine first, then nitrate, then acetylate. But Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitrating and brominating.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps option B is correct because after bromination and nitration, the acetylation is done under different conditions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Considering the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the key challenge lies in the sequence of reactions to achieve the correct positioning of the substituents: an acetyl group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The directing effects of the substituents and the activation/deactivation of the aromatic ring must be carefully considered.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) adds the acetyl group to benzene, creating acetophenone. The acetyl group is an ortho/para-directing, activating group.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine to the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group, which is directed by the acetyl group (ortho/para) and the bromine (ortho/para).
4. Subsequent steps (iv–vii) include additional reactions that are unnecessary for the target molecule, as the target has only one nitro and one bromine group.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the correct positioning of the substituents, as the nitro group would not end up at position 5 relative to the acetyl group.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine to benzene, creating bromobenzene. Bromine is an ortho/para-directing, deactivating group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group to the ortho or para positions relative to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) attempts to add the acetyl group. However, the ring is deactivated due to the presence of the nitro and bromine groups, making Friedel-Crafts acetylation unlikely to proceed.

**Conclusion**: This sequence is not viable because the acetylation step would fail on a deactivated ring.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group to benzene, creating nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-directing, deactivating group.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine group, which is an ortho/para-directing, activating group.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) adds the acetyl group to the ortho or para positions relative to the amine group.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine, directed by the acetyl group (ortho/para).
5. Subsequent steps (v–vii) include additional reactions that are unnecessary for the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the correct positioning of the substituents, as the bromine and nitro groups would not end up in the desired positions.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group to benzene, creating nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-directing, deactivating group.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine group, which is an ortho/para-directing, activating group.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and reduction (H₃PO₂) are typically used for introducing substituents via diazonium salts, but this sequence does not align with the target molecule.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine, but the sequence does not ensure the correct positioning of the substituents.
5. **Step v**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) attempts to add the acetyl group, but the ring is deactivated due to the presence of the nitro and bromine groups.

**Conclusion**: This sequence is not viable because the acetylation step would fail on a deactivated ring.

---

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, **Option B** is the most plausible, as it follows a logical sequence of bromination, nitration, and acetylation. However, the acetylation step in Option B is problematic due to the deactivated nature of the ring after nitration and bromination. Despite this limitation, Option B aligns most closely with the desired sequence of reactions.

ANSWER: B
