Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax in astronomy is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth during different times of the year. The formula for distance using parallax is d = 1/plx, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, if stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their distances are spread out in some way.

Let me think about it. If stars are spread uniformly in space, then the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So, how does that translate into the number of stars we observe with a given parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d. So, for stars at a distance d, their parallax is 1/d. If we consider a thin shell at a distance d, the thickness is a small change in d, say dd. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² * dd, since it's a spherical shell. The number of stars in this shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume, so n * 4πd² dd.

But we want the number per unit parallax, not per unit distance. Let's think in terms of plx. So, plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. The change in d with respect to plx is dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, actually, if plx increases, d decreases. So, when plx changes by dplx, d changes by - (1/plx²) dplx. Because d = (1/plx), so derivative is -1/plx².

So, the volume of the shell in terms of plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dd. Let's express d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in d, which is - (1/plx²) dplx. Substitute into the volume element:

Volume = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx. But wait, the negative sign just indicates the direction of change, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, the negative can be ignored for now. So, Volume ≈ 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx → 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me double-check. The shell in space is at distance d with thickness dd. The corresponding thickness in plx is dplx. But the relation between dd and dplx is dd = -d^2 dplx, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = -(1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting d = 1/plx, the volume element becomes 4πd² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ). So that's 4π (1 / plx^4) (-d plx). Again, the negative just tells us the direction, but the magnitude is 4π/(plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is n multiplied by this volume. So, number of stars N = n * 4π/(plx^4) d plx.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, N per d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (d plx) decreases as plx increases, and it's inversely proportional to plx^4.

Wait, but I thought stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning number density n is constant. So the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, when we calculate the number in a shell, it depends on the surface area (4πd²) and the thickness (dd). But converting to plx, since they're asking for per unit plx, the dependence on plx comes out as 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the correct option would be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach: if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to 4π d² dd. Because for a uniform distribution, N = n * 4π d² dd.

But how does that translate to plx? Since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. Let me express everything in terms of plx.

dd = d (d plx / d plx). Wait, maybe it's better to find d plx in terms of dd.

As before, plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d^2) dd → dd = -d² d plx. So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π d² * (-d² d plx) ) → N = -4 π n d^4 d plx.

But d = 1/plx → d^4 = 1/plx^4. So,

N = -4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in a d plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hence, the number per unit plx is ~1/plx^4, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution. Let me think differently. Let's consider the number of stars per unit parallax. So, the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is n * 4 pi (d)^2 * dd, where d is the distance corresponding to plx.

d = 1/plx, so d^2 = 1/plx^2.

The thickness in distance, dd, is related to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting, the number is n * 4 pi (1/plx^2) * ( - 1/plx^2 d plx ) = n * (-4 pi / plx^4) d plx.

The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but we're more concerned about the magnitude. So N = (4 pi n / plx^4) d plx. Therefore, the number per unit plx is (4 pi n) / plx^4.

So yes, the correct answer is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (\(n\)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dd\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \(4\pi d^2 dd\).

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), so \(d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\). The thickness \(dd\) is related to a small change in parallax \(d\text{plx}\) by \(dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\). Substituting these into the volume element, the number of stars in a shell becomes:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but the magnitude shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\). Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as \(\text{plx}^4\).
