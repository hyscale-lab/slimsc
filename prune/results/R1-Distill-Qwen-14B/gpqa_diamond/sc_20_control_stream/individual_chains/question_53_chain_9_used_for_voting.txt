Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's an aromatic ring with two substituents. The possible options have different molecular formulas, so I need to figure out how many carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens are present.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. So, that means the compound has an ester functional group. An ester's structure is usually R-O-CO-R', right? So, the molecule likely has an ester linkage.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Wait, no, the description says six signals, but let me parse them again. The NMR shows two signals for aromatic H, two for vinyl H (with one being a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets), and two for -CH3 groups. Oh, and no -CH2 signals. So, let's think about what that implies.

For aromatic H: a di-substituted benzene ring. The substitution pattern affects the splitting. But wait, if it's a di-substituted ring, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Let's say they're para to each other, which would give two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, they could be ortho or meta. But wait, in a 6-membered ring, if it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that cause different splitting.

Wait, but the two aromatic H signals. So, either the substituents are para, leading to two equivalent H environments (like two sets of H's, each with two H's each?), or maybe one substituent is in a certain position causing the ring to have two types of H's.

But moving on: the vinyl H's. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Vinyl groups have protons adjacent to double bonds. So, perhaps this is part of an ester group, like a vinyl ester? Or maybe the substituents on the ring include a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group and another group. Let's think about structure. Let's consider that the di-substituted ring has two groups: one is an ester, perhaps as a substituent, and another group. Or maybe each substituent is part of an ester functional group.

Wait, wait. If the ring is di-substituted, each substituent could be an ester group? Or maybe each substituent is a different group, one being an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), but wait, esters are usually R-O-CO-R', so maybe the substituent is something like a methoxycarbonyl group or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and another group, like a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two -CH3 signals, which suggests that there are two different methyl groups in the molecule. Because if they were equivalent, there would be only one signal. So, two different methyl groups. Hmm.

So, let's think about possible structures. Let me imagine the aromatic ring with two substituents. One substituent could be an ester group, which would have a carbonyl and an oxygen. The other substituent might be an ethenyl (vinyl) group, but wait, vinyl groups have two H's. But in the NMR, there are two signals for vinyl H. Oh, maybe each substituent has a vinyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and another is an ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group. Let me sketch a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester, perhaps as a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3?), but that's a carbonate, not an ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester, such as an acetyl group (like O-CO-R), but that's a ketone. Wait, no, an ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R'.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the possible structure. Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OCH2CH3 or something, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are each an ester group, but that would imply a di-ester, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, could the substituents be one ester and another group, like a methyl group?

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So perhaps the substituent is an ester group that includes a methyl, and another substituent that's a methyl group. Or another possibility: one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group which itself has a CH2 group, but the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. Wait, the NMR says no CH2 signals, so maybe the substituents don't have any CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (like CH2=CHCH3), but that would have more signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3). But wait, that's a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The compound is a di-substituted benzene, so the base is C6H4. The substituents add more carbons and hydrogens. Let me calculate.

Assume the two substituents add a total of (n) carbons and (m) hydrogens. The benzene ring is C6H4. Then, the substituents add (n) C and (m) H. So, the total formula would be C6+n H4+m + other H from substituents.

But the options are, for example, C11H12O2. So, 11 C in total. 6 in benzene, 5 in substituents. Wait, 6 + 5=11. So each substituent would add 2.5 carbons on average, which doesn't make sense because substituents have integer carbons. So perhaps one substituent has 3 carbons, the other 2. Or maybe both have 3, but that might be too many.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-R) and another group. Let's think about what an ester group adds. For example, a methyl ester would be O-CO-OCH3. That substituent would add 3 carbons (the O is part of the substituent), but wait, the benzene is attached to the oxygen. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is four carbons in the substituent (O is not a carbon). Wait, no, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, for example, if R is methyl, then substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons (the O-CO-O part is functional groups, but the substituent adds 3 carbons in the R group.

Wait, perhaps I need to model each substituent. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, say, O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2? No, because that's ethylene, which doesn't have a substituent. Or perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, but that's more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group. But that's a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Let me think: the ester substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is something like methyl. So, substituent is O-CO-OCH3. That would add 3 carbons (the O-CO-O is part of the substituent, but R is CH3, which adds 1 carbon). So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons (O is not a carbon, but the substituent is attached to the benzene via the oxygen. So the substituent has 3 carbons (the COOCH3 group is 3 carbons: C-O-C-O-CH3? Wait, no, COOCH3 has 3 carbons in the substituent: the carbonyl (C=O), then the oxygen, then the methyl (CH3). So that's 3 carbons from the substituent.

Wait, the benzene is C6H5-O-CO-OCH3? So that substituent would be one substituent, adding 3 carbons (the O-CO-OCH3 has 3 carbons: one from the carbonyl, one from the ester oxygen, and one from the methyl). Wait, no: O-CO-OCH3 is a group with three carbons in it? Wait, the structure is O-CO-OCH3: the carbonyl is C=O, then O connected to the benzene, and the other O connected to CH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons in the substituent (the COOCH3). So that's 3 carbons for one substituent. The other substituent is, say, a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), but that's two carbons. Wait, no, a vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So that substituent is CH2=CH-, which is two carbons. So in this case, substituents would add 3 + 2 = 5 carbons, plus the benzene's 6. Total C: 6 + 5 = 11. So the formula would be C11... Wait, but wait, the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-OCH3 (5 carbons in total? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (the carbonyl, oxygen, and methyl). So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (so 3 carbons) and the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So that's two carbons. So substituents add 3 + 2 = 5. Benzene is 6, so 6 + 5 = 11 carbons. So the formula is C11... but wait, the substituent's structure may have more.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, perhaps one substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have more carbons. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. Let's explore that. One substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons), the other is a methyl group (CH3, 1 carbon). So substituents add 3 + 1 = 4 carbons. Benzene has 6. Total is 10. But none of the options are C10... Wait, the options are C11, C12. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The molecular formula can tell us about rings and double bonds. For each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N: (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be the benzene ring (3 double bonds or one ring and two double bonds?), but wait, benzene has 3 degrees (one ring and three double bonds, but in reality, it's considered as 4n+2 π electrons, but in terms of degrees of unsaturation, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds, but arranged in a conjugated way, so three degrees. Then the ester group has a double bond (the carbonyl), so that's four degrees. The rest would come from any rings or double bonds in substituents.

Option D: C11H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So six degrees. So that would include benzene (3), ester (1), and maybe another double bond or ring.

The NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Vinyl groups have double bonds, so each substituent with a vinyl group contributes to that. So perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) and another substituent is an ester. Alternatively, maybe both substituents have vinyl groups, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, but arranged differently. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and the other is an ester with a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a vinyl group (like CH2=CHCOO-). That would contribute to the vinyl protons.

Wait, let's think about the substituent structure. If one substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group, then the structure would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2- something? No, wait, that's an ethyl group. Alternatively, if the R is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), but that's three carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCO-O- attached to the benzene. Wait, that would make the substituent a vinyl ester. So, the substituent would be CH2=CHCOO- attached via the oxygen.

But then, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-... no, wait, it's O-CO-O-(CH2CH2?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. But di-esters would have two ester groups, but that would require more oxygens, which isn't the case here because the formula only has two O's.

Wait, the formula includes O2. So the ester group contributes two oxygens. So, the substituents can't have more than that.

So, the substituent with the ester would be O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. So, for example, R could be methyl (O-CO-OCH3) or ethyl, but that would add more carbons.

So, let's get back to the NMR. The vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet indicates each proton has one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is more complex; perhaps each proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons, leading to a quartet, but perhaps it's a doublet of doublets of doublets? Wait, a doublet of quartets would mean each proton is split into a quartet (n+1, where n=3), but why would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is part of a substituent that's adjacent to another group. For example, a substituent like CH2=CH-OOC- attached to the ring. Wait, but that's a vinyl ether, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group. Wait, R could be CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, R is CH2CH3, but that's ethyl, which wouldn't have vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group attached elsewhere. Maybe the substituent is a benzyl group with a vinyl group attached. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate group: O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's not a vinyl group; that's an ethyl group. Wait, no, if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, that's an ethyl ester. But that doesn't involve a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring), and the other is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3). So, benzene with two substituents: one vinyl, one ester. In that case, the substituents would add 2 (from vinyl) + 3 (from ester) =5 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total C is 11. So the formula would be C11... Looking at the options, option A is C11H14O2, option D is C11H12O2.

Now, let's calculate the number of H's. Benzene has 4 H's (since it's di-substituted). But wait, let me think: di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns affecting the number of H's. For example, para substitution would leave two sets of two H's each. Ortho would have two H's adjacent, and so on. But in any case, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H's.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Each substituent is likely in the para position to each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets, each with two H's. So that's four aromatic H's in total.

Then, the substituents themselves contribute H's. The vinyl group has two H's (since it's CH2=CH-), but each of those would have different neighboring groups. The ester substituent would have a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), which has three H's. Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So the substituents must each have a methyl group.

Wait, but the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has a methyl (CH3) group. The vinyl group doesn't have a methyl. So where's the other methyl coming from? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a propyl group or something else. Wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that one substituent is an ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3), which is a ethyl ester. So that would add two carbons from the ester group (the ethyl part). But that would give a substituent with more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group and another substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3). So, substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-. So, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 adds 3 carbons (from the COOCH3 group), and the vinyl group adds 2 carbons. So total substituents add 5, plus benzene's 6, so 11 carbons. The formula would be C11... So looking at the options, either A or D.

Now, let's count the hydrogens.

Benzene has 4 H's (since two substituents para; each substituent would cause two H's to be equivalent, and the other two H's to be in another equivalent pair). So, two signals for aromatic H's, each integrating for 2 H's.

The vinyl group: CH2=CH- has two H's on the CH2, which are adjacent to the double bond. The vinyl protons are usually deshielded and split based on their neighbors. Let's say the CH2=CH- group is attached to the benzene ring. So the vinyl protons would be a triplet? Or perhaps a doublet. Wait, but the NMR shows one signal as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Maybe the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-). In that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH part. The protons on the CH2 would be next to the double bond and possibly split into a quartet if coupled with another CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a coupling with another proton.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NMR signals.

- Two aromatic H signals: indicates two sets of aromatic protons, likely para substitution, each pair equivalent.

- Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet (each proton has one neighboring proton), the other is a doublet of quartets (each proton has three neighboring protons, leading to a quartet, but why a doublet of quartets? Maybe each proton is coupled with two different sets of protons. For example, if each proton is adjacent to two different groups, each with two protons, leading to a quartet and a doublet? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's getting too long. Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2 something, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond. For example, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester oxygen. Like, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl group with more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which would add up to 3 + 2 =5 carbons, making the total carbons 6 +5=11. So the formula would be C11H14O2 or C11H12O2.

Now, to figure out the H count.

Benzene: di-substituted, so four H's. Let's say two sets of two H's each. So, two signals, each integrating for 2 H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3 has the methyl group, which contributes 3 H's. So that's one CH3 signal.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2=CH- group has two H's on the CH2 and one H on the CH (if it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring). Wait, no: if it's CH2=CH-X attached to the ring, X is the benzene. So, the structure is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the CH2 would have two H's, and the CH would have one H. Wait, no: CH2=CH- attached to the ring would have the CH2 adjacent to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, wait, that's a single bond. Wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, making it a styrene-like group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2? No; wait, more accurately, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify: the substituent is a vinyl group, meaning it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond? No, wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH2s? No, that would be a single bond. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, which would be a vinyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2- but as a double bond, so it's -CH2-CH2- where the two CH2 are connected by a double bond.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me correct. A vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, actually, it's -CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent has two CH2 groups, but the first CH2 is attached to the ring, and the second is part of the double bond. So the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group attached to the ring. Wait, no, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. So, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's an ethyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just count the H's.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and CH2=CH- (vinyl), then:

Benzene: 4 H's (two sets of two each)

Ester group: O-CO-OCH3 has a CH3 group, which contributes 3 H's.

Vinyl group: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2 group attached to the ring has two H's, and the CH has one H. But wait, in the vinyl group, the structure is CH2=CH-, so the substituent attached to the benzene is CH2-CH2 with a double bond. So, the substituent is CH2=CH-X, where X is the benzene.

Wait, no. The substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a propyl group, but that's a single bond. So, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The substituents add 5 carbons (since 6+5=11), so the substituents are probably an ester (3 carbons) and a vinyl group (2 carbons). So, option A is C11H14O2 and D is C11H12O2.

Now, let's compute the H's.

Benzene: 4 H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3. The methyl group contributes 3 H's.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2 group would have 2 H's, and the CH group (if any) would have 1 H. But in this case, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached directly to the ring, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring as a substituent, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. No, wait, the substituent is CH2=CH-, meaning the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, making it a styrene substituent.

So, the substituent would have the structure benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's single bonds. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-). So, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring. That would add three carbons. But then, the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons), making total substituents 3+3=6. Benzene is 6, so total C would be 12. Which would make the formula C12H... Looking at the options, option B is C12H14O2 and C is C12H12O2.

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. If the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), then the vinyl protons are the two H's on the CH2=CH part. Those H's are adjacent to each other and perhaps to another group, leading to splitting.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps one substituent has a vinyl group with two H's (doublet) and another substituent has a different structure, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a styryl group (like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond). Wait, no, that's a single bond. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, where the ester is attached to a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group, but that's not an ester. Hmm.

Another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's consider the number of H's.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons) and CH2=CH- (2 carbons), then the total carbons are 6 +3 +2 =11. So the formula would be C11... So the options are A (C11H14O2) and D (C11H12O2).

Now, the H count:

Benzene: 4 H's (if para substituents).

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3. The methyl group contributes 3 H's.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2 group (attached to the ring) has 2 H's, and the CH group (if any) would have 1 H. But wait, if the substituent is CH2=CH-, then the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the substituent is CH2=CH-, which is two carbons. So, the substituent has two H's on the CH2 and one H on the CH. So, in total, 3 H's from the vinyl group.

Wait, but the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group. No, the substituent is a vinyl group, so benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3 isn't a vinyl. I'm getting stuck again.

Let me try to count the H's without knowing the exact structure.

Total H's in the molecule would be:

Benzene: 4 H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3 contributes 3 H's (from the methyl).

Vinyl substituent: Let's say it's CH2=CH-X, where X is the ring. So, the CH2 has 2 H's, and the CH has 1 H. So, 3 H's from the vinyl group.

But wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl H's. So, perhaps the vinyl group has two sets of H's. For example, if it's a trans double bond, the H's on each end would be different. Or maybe the substituent is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which would have two H's on one CH2 and one H on the adjacent CH.

But I'm not quite getting this. Let's think about the options. For the molecular formula C11H14O2 (option A) vs. C11H12O2 (option D).

The difference is two H's. So, if the structure has more double bonds or rings, it would have fewer H's.

Assuming the substituents are an ester (O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), the total H's would be:

Benzene:4.

Ester:3.

Vinyl:3.

Plus any H's from other substituents. Wait, but the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-.

So, total H's:4 +3 +3 =10. But the options have either 14 or 12 H's. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent with the vinyl group is part of an ester. Like, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (an ethyl propionate?), but that might have more H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3, which would add more carbons. But that complicates the count.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's even longer.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures for each option.

Option D: C11H12O2.

The degrees of unsaturation are 6. So, 6 rings/double bonds. Benzene contributes 4 (three double bonds and one ring?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, benzene has three double bonds, so three degrees. The ester group has one double bond (the carbonyl), that's four. So, the substituents must contribute two more degrees. So maybe a double bond in a substituent and a ring elsewhere, but that's not likely.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H's, so perhaps the substituent has a double bond, accounting for that. So, the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), adding one more double bond, which would account for the remaining degree. So, total degrees: 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. But option D has 6 degrees, so perhaps another ring or double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which would require a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, which is a CH2 connected to another benzene, but that would add more carbons and degrees.

This is getting quite complicated. Let me try to think of another approach. The NMR has two CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups. So, the molecule must have two distinct methyl groups.

In the ester group, the R group could be a methyl (O-CO-OCH3), contributing one methyl group. The other methyl group must come from somewhere else, perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group. So, one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (ester), and the other is a methyl group (CH3). So, substituent 1: 3 carbons, substituent 2:1 carbon. Total substituents:4 carbons, plus benzene's 6, so 10 carbons. But the options have 11 or 12, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) attached to the ester oxygen. So, substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which adds 3 carbons from the ester group and 3 from the propyl, totaling 6. But then, substituents would be 3 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) =5. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3, 3 carbons), and the other is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-, 3 carbons). That would add 6 carbons, making the total 6 (benzene) +6=12, which would be option B (C12H14O2) or C (C12H12O2). But the NMR shows two CH3 groups, which would be the methyl from the ester and another methyl elsewhere. So, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, for example, substituent could be a group like CH2=CH-CO-O- attached to the benzene. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=C(CH3)-O-CO- attached to the benzene. But that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has two vinyl H signals. Let's think about each substituent contributing a set of vinyl H's.

If one substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but again, not a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to the benzene. That would be a vinyl ether, but not an ester. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. Let's say:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (ester, 3 carbons, contributes a methyl group).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (vinyl group, 2 carbons, contributes two CH2 H's).

Wait, but that would give a total of 6 +3 +2 =11 C's. So formula would be C11H... Let's count H's.

Benzene:4.

Ester:3 (methyl).

Vinyl:2 (CH2) +1 (CH) =3.

Total H's:4+3+3=10. But options have 12 or 14. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some H's. Maybe the substituent is a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), which adds three carbons. So substituents would be:

Ester: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C's).

Propenyl: CH2=CHCH2- (3 C's).

Total substituents:6 C's. Benzene is 6, so total is 12 C's, making formula C12H... So looking at options B and C.

Now, H count:

Benzene:4.

Ester:3 (methyl).

Propenyl: CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-X, where X is the ring. So, the CH2=CHCH2- group has CH2 (with 2 H's), CH (with 1 H), and CH2 (with 2 H's attached to the ring). Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So, substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent's H's: the CH2= has 2 H's, the CH has 1 H, and the CH2 attached to the ring has 2 H's. Wait, but the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-, so the CH2 attached to the ring has two H's, the CH has one H, and the CH2= has two H's.

So substituent contributes 2 (CH2=) +1 (CH) +2 (CH2-) =5 H's.

Ester contributes 3 H's (methyl).

Benzene:4.

Total H's:4+3+5=12.

Looking at the options, C12H12O2 is option C. So, that would fit if the formula is C12H12O2.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. In this case, the ester's methyl is one CH3, and the substituent is a propenyl group, which doesn't have a CH3. So that's only one CH3 signal. But the NMR shows two, so this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the substituent has another methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO- attached to the ring. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring, and another substituent is a vinyl ester. Let me think: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which adds 5 carbons (O-CO-O and ethyl), and substituent 2 is CH3 (methyl). So substituents add 5 +1=6, making total C 6+6=12. So formula would be C12H... 

H count:

Benzene:4.

Ester substituent (ethyl ester): O-CO-OCH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H's (CH2CH3 has 2+3=5).

Methyl substituent:1 C, 3 H's.

But wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is 3 C's (COO) plus 2 C's (ethyl), making 5 C's in the substituent. So, 5 C's substituent, plus benzene's 6, another substituent (CH3, 1 C), total 6+5+1=12 C's.

H count:

Benzene:4.

Ester substituent: ethyl group contributes 5 H's.

Methyl substituent:3 H's.

Total:4+5+3=12 H's. So formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. In this case, the substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH3 (which has a CH2CH3 group, contributing a triplet for the CH3 at the end) and a CH3 group attached to the ring. So, two CH3 groups: one from the ethyl ester and one from the methyl substituent. That would explain the two CH3 signals in the NMR.

The aromatic H's: in para substitution, two signals each integrating for 2 H's.

Vinyl H's: the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester, not a vinyl group. So where are the vinyl H's? Hmm, that complicates things because the NMR shows two vinyl H signals.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake there. The substituent must have a vinyl group to account for the NMR's vinyl H's. So, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester, and substituent 2 is a methyl group.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (no, that's not a vinyl). Alternatively, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is a pentyl ester. But that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (pentyl ester), which adds 6 carbons, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2, which is an ethyl ester, but that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Perhaps I should focus on the NMR signals.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H signals (likely para substituents)

- Two vinyl H signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets.

- Two CH3 signals.

So, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group, both of which bring their own CH3 groups.

For example:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (ester, contributes a CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-O-R, where R is something with a CH3.

Wait, but R can't be anything else as we're trying to keep it simple.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO- attached to the ring. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-) attached to the ring. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2-.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C's, contributes a CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH2- (3 C's, contributes a CH2 and a CH group).

So, substituents add 3+3=6 C's. Benzene is 6, total C's:12. So formula is C12H... Let's count H's.

Benzene:4.

Ester substituent:3 H's (methyl).

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring.

The substituent has:

CH2= has 2 H's.

CH has 1 H.

CH2- attached to the ring has 2 H's.

So, substituent contributes 2 +1 +2=5 H's.

Total H's:4 +3 +5 =12.

So formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second CH2. So, substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent's H's are:

The CH2= has 2 H's (a doublet, perhaps).

The CH has 1 H (could be a triplet or something else).

The CH2 attached to the ring has 2 H's (maybe as a quartet due to coupling with adjacent groups).

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the substituent's H's correspond to this.

The CH2= would have 2 H's as a doublet (coupled with the adjacent CH).

The CH would have 1 H, but perhaps it's coupled with the CH2 and another group, leading to a quartet. Or maybe the CH2 attached to the ring has 2 H's that are split into a quartet due to coupling with the vinyl CH2.

Alternatively, the substituent's structure might be more like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO- attached to the ring, but that's getting too complex.

In any case, the molecular formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. In this case, substituent 1 (ester) has a CH3, and substituent 2 (propenyl) doesn't have a CH3. So, why are there two CH3 signals? That suggests there are two different methyl groups in the molecule.

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group and substituent 1 is a vinyl ester.

So:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a longer chain, perhaps with a double bond).

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is a pentyl ester. But that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester, such as O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's even longer.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to match the options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

From earlier analysis, substituents are likely an ester and a vinyl group, leading to 11 carbons (if ester is O-CO-OCH3 and vinyl is CH2=CH-) or 12 (if substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH3 and CH2=CHCH2-).

The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, substituent 1 (ester) has a CH3, and substituent 2 must have another CH3.

Ah! So, substituent 2 is a methyl group. So, substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (ester, 3 C's) and CH3 (methyl, 1 C). So, substituents add 4 C's. Benzene is 6, so total is 10 C's. But the options don't have 10 C's.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, substituent 2 is CH(CH3)2. But that would add more C's.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CHCH(CH3)2. But that's getting too complex.

Another possibility: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) and substituent 2 is CH3 (methyl). So substituents add 3 (ester) +1 (methyl) =4 C's. Benzene is 6, so total C's 10. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) and substituent 2 is CH3. So substituents add 4 C's. Benzene:6, total 10. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. That suggests that each group is in a unique environment, so the molecule has a certain symmetry.

If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic H's would split into two signals, each integrating for 2 H's.

The vinyl H's could be from a substituent that's in a different environment from the other substituent.

The two CH3 signals suggest two different methyl groups, perhaps in different environments.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-... No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond somewhere. But that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to the benzene. But that's a vinyl ether, not an ester.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propenoate ester, which is an ester with a vinyl group. So, substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Maybe it's O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2, which would add a vinyl group to the ester.

So substituent: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2.

This substituent brings in a vinyl group (CH=CH2) as part of the ester.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2 (which is a vinyl ester), substituent 2: another group, perhaps a methyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, the ester's substituent would have a CH2CH=CH2, which doesn't have a CH3. So the other substituent must be a CH3 group.

So substituents: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2 (5 C's, since O-CO-O is 3, and CH2CH=CH2 is 3 more? No, O-CO-O is connected to CH2CH=CH2, which is 3 C's. So substituent 1 is 3 (ester) +3 (CH2CH=CH2)=6 C's. Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C). So total substituents:7 C's. Benzene is 6, so total C's 13, which isn't any option. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is really challenging. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

The correct answer is likely option C) C12H12O2 because the substituents add up to 12 carbons and the H count fits with the NMR signals, including two CH3 groups (from the ester and another substituent). But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the given spectroscopic data and molecular options systematically:

### Key Observations:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group (C=O stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹) indicates the compound contains an ester functional group.
2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic protons**: Two signals, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring with two distinct sets of aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl protons**: Two signals—one doublet and one doublet of quartets—indicating the presence of a vinyl group in a specific environment.
   - **Methyl protons**: Two signals, implying two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.
   - **No signals for CH₂ groups**: Rules out the presence of any methylene groups.

### Molecular Formula Analysis:
The compound is a di-substituted benzene (C₆H₄) with two substituents. The molecular options are:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**
- **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**
- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**
- **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degrees of unsaturation for each option were calculated:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: 6 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 from substituents).
- **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: 5 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 1 from substituents).
- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: 6 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 from substituents).
- **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: 5 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 1 from substituents).

#### Substituent Contributions:
The molecule contains:
- An ester group (O-CO-R), contributing to the oxygen count and likely a methyl or ethyl group.
- A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), contributing to the vinyl proton signals.
- Two distinct methyl groups, as indicated by the two CH₃ signals in the NMR.

### Structural Interpretation:
- The para-substituted benzene explains the two aromatic proton signals.
- The ester group accounts for the oxygen atoms and one methyl group.
- The vinyl group explains the two vinyl proton signals.
- The second methyl group must come from another substituent.

### Molecular Formula Determination:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** and **C₁₁H₁₄O₂** have 11 carbons, which would require one substituent to be a vinyl group (2 carbons) and the other an ester group (3 carbons). However, this does not account for the second methyl group without exceeding the carbon count.
- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** and **C₁₂H₁₄O₂** have 12 carbons, allowing for a vinyl group (2 carbons), an ester group (3 carbons), and another substituent (7 carbons). This aligns with the NMR data, including the two methyl groups.

### Final Answer:
The molecular formula **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** (Option C) best fits the spectroscopic data:
- Benzene contributes 6 carbons.
- The ester group contributes 3 carbons (including one methyl group).
- The vinyl group contributes 2 carbons.
- The remaining 1 carbon accounts for the second methyl group.

This matches the NMR signals (two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl) and the molecular formula.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's an aromatic ring with two substituents. The possible options have different molecular formulas, so I need to figure out how many carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens are present.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. So, that means the compound has an ester functional group. An ester's structure is usually R-O-CO-R', right? So, the molecule likely has an ester linkage.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Wait, no, the description says six signals, but let me parse them again. The NMR shows two signals for aromatic H, two for vinyl H (with one being a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets), and two for -CH3 groups. Oh, and no -CH2 signals. So, let's think about what that implies.

For aromatic H: a di-substituted benzene ring. The substitution pattern affects the splitting. But wait, if it's a di-substituted ring, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Let's say they're para to each other, which would give two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, they could be ortho or meta. But wait, in a 6-membered ring, if it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that cause different splitting.

Wait, but the two aromatic H signals. So, either the substituents are para, leading to two equivalent H environments (like two sets of H's, each with two H's each?), or maybe one substituent is in a certain position causing the ring to have two types of H's.

But moving on: the vinyl H's. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Vinyl groups have protons adjacent to double bonds. So, perhaps this is part of an ester group, like a vinyl ester? Or maybe the substituents on the ring include a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group and another group. Let's think about structure. Let's consider that the di-substituted ring has two groups: one is an ester, perhaps as a substituent, and another group. Or maybe each substituent is part of an ester functional group.

Wait, wait. If the ring is di-substituted, each substituent could be an ester group? Or maybe each substituent is a different group, one being an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), but wait, esters are usually R-O-CO-R', so maybe the substituent is something like a methoxycarbonyl group or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and another group, like a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two -CH3 signals, which suggests that there are two different methyl groups in the molecule. Because if they were equivalent, there would be only one signal. So, two different methyl groups. Hmm.

So, let's think about possible structures. Let me imagine the aromatic ring with two substituents. One substituent could be an ester group, which would have a carbonyl and an oxygen. The other substituent might be an ethenyl (vinyl) group, but wait, vinyl groups have two H's. But in the NMR, there are two signals for vinyl H. Oh, maybe each substituent has a vinyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and another is an ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group. Let me sketch a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester, perhaps as a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3?), but that's a carbonate, not an ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester, such as an acetyl group (like O-CO-R), but that's a ketone. Wait, no, an ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R'.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the possible structure. Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OCH2CH3 or something, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are each an ester group, but that would imply a di-ester, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, could the substituents be one ester and another group, like a methyl group?

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So perhaps the substituent is an ester group that includes a methyl, and another substituent that's a methyl group. Or another possibility: one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group which itself has a CH2 group, but the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. Wait, the NMR says no CH2 signals, so maybe the substituents don't have any CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (like CH2=CHCH3), but that would have more signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3). But wait, that's a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The compound is a di-substituted benzene, so the base is C6H4. The substituents add more carbons and hydrogens. Let me calculate.

Assume the two substituents add a total of (n) carbons and (m) hydrogens. The benzene ring is C6H4. Then, the substituents add (n) C and (m) H. So, the total formula would be C6+n H4+m + other H from substituents.

But the options are, for example, C11H12O2. So, 11 C in total. 6 in benzene, 5 in substituents. Wait, 6 + 5=11. So each substituent would add 2.5 carbons on average, which doesn't make sense because substituents have integer carbons. So perhaps one substituent has 3 carbons, the other 2. Or maybe both have 3, but that might be too many.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-R) and another group. Let's think about what an ester group adds. For example, a methyl ester would be O-CO-OCH3. That substituent would add 3 carbons (the O is part of the substituent), but wait, the benzene is attached to the oxygen. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is four carbons in the substituent (O is not a carbon). Wait, no, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, for example, if R is methyl, then substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons (the O-CO-O part is functional groups, but the substituent adds 3 carbons in the R group.

Wait, perhaps I need to model each substituent. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, say, O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2? No, because that's ethylene, which doesn't have a substituent. Or perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, but that's more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group. But that's a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Let me think: the ester substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is something like methyl. So, substituent is O-CO-OCH3. That would add 3 carbons (the O-CO-O is part of the substituent, but R is CH3, which adds 1 carbon). So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons (O is not a carbon, but the substituent is attached to the benzene via the oxygen. So the substituent has 3 carbons (the COOCH3 group is 3 carbons: C-O-C-O-CH3? Wait, no, COOCH3 has 3 carbons in the substituent: the carbonyl (C=O), then the oxygen, then the methyl (CH3). So that's 3 carbons from the substituent.

Wait, the benzene is C6H5-O-CO-OCH3? So that substituent would be one substituent, adding 3 carbons (the O-CO-OCH3 has 3 carbons: one from the carbonyl, one from the ester oxygen, and one from the methyl). Wait, no: O-CO-OCH3 is a group with three carbons in it? Wait, the structure is O-CO-OCH3: the carbonyl is C=O, then O connected to the benzene, and the other O connected to CH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons in the substituent (the COOCH3). So that's 3 carbons for one substituent. The other substituent is, say, a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), but that's two carbons. Wait, no, a vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So that substituent is CH2=CH-, which is two carbons. So in this case, substituents would add 3 + 2 = 5 carbons, plus the benzene's 6. Total C: 6 + 5 = 11. So the formula would be C11... Wait, but wait, the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-OCH3 (5 carbons in total? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (the carbonyl, oxygen, and methyl). So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (so 3 carbons) and the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So that's two carbons. So substituents add 3 + 2 = 5. Benzene is 6, so 6 + 5 = 11 carbons. So the formula is C11... but wait, the substituent's structure may have more.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, perhaps one substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have more carbons. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. Let's explore that. One substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons), the other is a methyl group (CH3, 1 carbon). So substituents add 3 + 1 = 4 carbons. Benzene has 6. Total is 10. But none of the options are C10... Wait, the options are C11, C12. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The molecular formula can tell us about rings and double bonds. For each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N: (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be the benzene ring (3 double bonds or one ring and two double bonds?), but wait, benzene has 3 degrees (one ring and three double bonds, but in reality, it's considered as 4n+2 π electrons, but in terms of degrees of unsaturation, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds, but arranged in a conjugated way, so three degrees. Then the ester group has a double bond (the carbonyl), so that's four degrees. The rest would come from any rings or double bonds in substituents.

Option D: C11H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So six degrees. So that would include benzene (3), ester (1), and maybe another double bond or ring.

The NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Vinyl groups have double bonds, so each substituent with a vinyl group contributes to that. So perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) and another substituent is an ester. Alternatively, maybe both substituents have vinyl groups, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, but arranged differently. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and the other is an ester with a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a vinyl group (like CH2=CHCOO-). That would contribute to the vinyl protons.

Wait, let's think about the substituent structure. If one substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group, then the structure would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2- something? No, wait, that's an ethyl group. Alternatively, if the R is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), but that's three carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCO-O- attached to the benzene. Wait, that would make the substituent a vinyl ester. So, the substituent would be CH2=CHCOO- attached via the oxygen.

But then, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-... no, wait, it's O-CO-O-(CH2CH2?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. But di-esters would have two ester groups, but that would require more oxygens, which isn't the case here because the formula only has two O's.

Wait, the formula includes O2. So the ester group contributes two oxygens. So, the substituents can't have more than that.

So, the substituent with the ester would be O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. So, for example, R could be methyl (O-CO-OCH3) or ethyl, but that would add more carbons.

So, let's get back to the NMR. The vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet indicates each proton has one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is more complex; perhaps each proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons, leading to a quartet, but perhaps it's a doublet of doublets of doublets? Wait, a doublet of quartets would mean each proton is split into a quartet (n+1, where n=3), but why would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is part of a substituent that's adjacent to another group. For example, a substituent like CH2=CH-OOC- attached to the ring. Wait, but that's a vinyl ether, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group. Wait, R could be CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, R is CH2CH3, but that's ethyl, which wouldn't have vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group attached elsewhere. Maybe the substituent is a benzyl group with a vinyl group attached. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate group: O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's not a vinyl group; that's an ethyl group. Wait, no, if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, that's an ethyl ester. But that doesn't involve a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring), and the other is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3). So, benzene with two substituents: one vinyl, one ester. In that case, the substituents would add 2 (from vinyl) + 3 (from ester) =5 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total C is 11. So the formula would be C11... Looking at the options, option A is C11H14O2, option D is C11H12O2.

Now, let's calculate the number of H's. Benzene has 4 H's (since it's di-substituted). But wait, let me think: di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns affecting the number of H's. For example, para substitution would leave two sets of two H's each. Ortho would have two H's adjacent, and so on. But in any case, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H's.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Each substituent is likely in the para position to each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets, each with two H's. So that's four aromatic H's in total.

Then, the substituents themselves contribute H's. The vinyl group has two H's (since it's CH2=CH-), but each of those would have different neighboring groups. The ester substituent would have a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), which has three H's. Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So the substituents must each have a methyl group.

Wait, but the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has a methyl (CH3) group. The vinyl group doesn't have a methyl. So where's the other methyl coming from? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a propyl group or something else. Wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that one substituent is an ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3), which is a ethyl ester. So that would add two carbons from the ester group (the ethyl part). But that would give a substituent with more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group and another substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3). So, substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-. So, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 adds 3 carbons (from the COOCH3 group), and the vinyl group adds 2 carbons. So total substituents add 5, plus benzene's 6, so 11 carbons. The formula would be C11... So looking at the options, either A or D.

Now, let's count the hydrogens.

Benzene has 4 H's (since two substituents para; each substituent would cause two H's to be equivalent, and the other two H's to be in another equivalent pair). So, two signals for aromatic H's, each integrating for 2 H's.

The vinyl group: CH2=CH- has two H's on the CH2, which are adjacent to the double bond. The vinyl protons are usually deshielded and split based on their neighbors. Let's say the CH2=CH- group is attached to the benzene ring. So the vinyl protons would be a triplet? Or perhaps a doublet. Wait, but the NMR shows one signal as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Maybe the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-). In that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH part. The protons on the CH2 would be next to the double bond and possibly split into a quartet if coupled with another CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a coupling with another proton.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NMR signals.

- Two aromatic H signals: indicates two sets of aromatic protons, likely para substitution, each pair equivalent.

- Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet (each proton has one neighboring proton), the other is a doublet of quartets (each proton has three neighboring protons, leading to a quartet, but why a doublet of quartets? Maybe each proton is coupled with two different sets of protons. For example, if each proton is adjacent to two different groups, each with two protons, leading to a quartet and a doublet? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's getting too long. Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2 something, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond. For example, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester oxygen. Like, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl group with more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which would add up to 3 + 2 =5 carbons, making the total carbons 6 +5=11. So the formula would be C11H14O2 or C11H12O2.

Now, to figure out the H count.

Benzene: di-substituted, so four H's. Let's say two sets of two H's each. So, two signals, each integrating for 2 H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3 has the methyl group, which contributes 3 H's. So that's one CH3 signal.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2=CH- group has two H's on the CH2 and one H on the CH (if it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring). Wait, no: if it's CH2=CH-X attached to the ring, X is the benzene. So, the structure is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the CH2 would have two H's, and the CH would have one H. Wait, no: CH2=CH- attached to the ring would have the CH2 adjacent to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, wait, that's a single bond. Wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, making it a styrene-like group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2? No; wait, more accurately, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify: the substituent is a vinyl group, meaning it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond? No, wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH2s? No, that would be a single bond. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, which would be a vinyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2- but as a double bond, so it's -CH2-CH2- where the two CH2 are connected by a double bond.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me correct. A vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, actually, it's -CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent has two CH2 groups, but the first CH2 is attached to the ring, and the second is part of the double bond. So the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group attached to the ring. Wait, no, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. So, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's an ethyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just count the H's.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and CH2=CH- (vinyl), then:

Benzene: 4 H's (two sets of two each)

Ester group: O-CO-OCH3 has a CH3 group, which contributes 3 H's.

Vinyl group: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2 group attached to the ring has two H's, and the CH has one H. But wait, in the vinyl group, the structure is CH2=CH-, so the substituent attached to the benzene is CH2-CH2 with a double bond. So, the substituent is CH2=CH-X, where X is the benzene.

Wait, no. The substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a propyl group, but that's a single bond. So, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The substituents add 5 carbons (since 6+5=11), so the substituents are probably an ester (3 carbons) and a vinyl group (2 carbons). So, option A is C11H14O2 and D is C11H12O2.

Now, let's compute the H's.

Benzene: 4 H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3. The methyl group contributes 3 H's.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2 group would have 2 H's, and the CH group (if any) would have 1 H. But in this case, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached directly to the ring, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring as a substituent, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. No, wait, the substituent is CH2=CH-, meaning the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, making it a styrene substituent.

So, the substituent would have the structure benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's single bonds. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-). So, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring. That would add three carbons. But then, the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons), making total substituents 3+3=6. Benzene is 6, so total C would be 12. Which would make the formula C12H... Looking at the options, option B is C12H14O2 and C is C12H12O2.

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. If the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), then the vinyl protons are the two H's on the CH2=CH part. Those H's are adjacent to each other and perhaps to another group, leading to splitting.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps one substituent has a vinyl group with two H's (doublet) and another substituent has a different structure, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a styryl group (like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond). Wait, no, that's a single bond. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, where the ester is attached to a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group, but that's not an ester. Hmm.

Another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's consider the number of H's.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons) and CH2=CH- (2 carbons), then the total carbons are 6 +3 +2 =11. So the formula would be C11... So the options are A (C11H14O2) and D (C11H12O2).

Now, the H count:

Benzene: 4 H's (if para substituents).

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3. The methyl group contributes 3 H's.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2 group (attached to the ring) has 2 H's, and the CH group (if any) would have 1 H. But wait, if the substituent is CH2=CH-, then the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the substituent is CH2=CH-, which is two carbons. So, the substituent has two H's on the CH2 and one H on the CH. So, in total, 3 H's from the vinyl group.

Wait, but the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group. No, the substituent is a vinyl group, so benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3 isn't a vinyl. I'm getting stuck again.

Let me try to count the H's without knowing the exact structure.

Total H's in the molecule would be:

Benzene: 4 H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3 contributes 3 H's (from the methyl).

Vinyl substituent: Let's say it's CH2=CH-X, where X is the ring. So, the CH2 has 2 H's, and the CH has 1 H. So, 3 H's from the vinyl group.

But wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl H's. So, perhaps the vinyl group has two sets of H's. For example, if it's a trans double bond, the H's on each end would be different. Or maybe the substituent is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which would have two H's on one CH2 and one H on the adjacent CH.

But I'm not quite getting this. Let's think about the options. For the molecular formula C11H14O2 (option A) vs. C11H12O2 (option D).

The difference is two H's. So, if the structure has more double bonds or rings, it would have fewer H's.

Assuming the substituents are an ester (O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), the total H's would be:

Benzene:4.

Ester:3.

Vinyl:3.

Plus any H's from other substituents. Wait, but the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-.

So, total H's:4 +3 +3 =10. But the options have either 14 or 12 H's. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent with the vinyl group is part of an ester. Like, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (an ethyl propionate?), but that might have more H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3, which would add more carbons. But that complicates the count.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's even longer.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures for each option.

Option D: C11H12O2.

The degrees of unsaturation are 6. So, 6 rings/double bonds. Benzene contributes 4 (three double bonds and one ring?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, benzene has three double bonds, so three degrees. The ester group has one double bond (the carbonyl), that's four. So, the substituents must contribute two more degrees. So maybe a double bond in a substituent and a ring elsewhere, but that's not likely.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H's, so perhaps the substituent has a double bond, accounting for that. So, the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), adding one more double bond, which would account for the remaining degree. So, total degrees: 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. But option D has 6 degrees, so perhaps another ring or double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which would require a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, which is a CH2 connected to another benzene, but that would add more carbons and degrees.

This is getting quite complicated. Let me try to think of another approach. The NMR has two CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups. So, the molecule must have two distinct methyl groups.

In the ester group, the R group could be a methyl (O-CO-OCH3), contributing one methyl group. The other methyl group must come from somewhere else, perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group. So, one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (ester), and the other is a methyl group (CH3). So, substituent 1: 3 carbons, substituent 2:1 carbon. Total substituents:4 carbons, plus benzene's 6, so 10 carbons. But the options have 11 or 12, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) attached to the ester oxygen. So, substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which adds 3 carbons from the ester group and 3 from the propyl, totaling 6. But then, substituents would be 3 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) =5. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3, 3 carbons), and the other is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-, 3 carbons). That would add 6 carbons, making the total 6 (benzene) +6=12, which would be option B (C12H14O2) or C (C12H12O2). But the NMR shows two CH3 groups, which would be the methyl from the ester and another methyl elsewhere. So, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, for example, substituent could be a group like CH2=CH-CO-O- attached to the benzene. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=C(CH3)-O-CO- attached to the benzene. But that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has two vinyl H signals. Let's think about each substituent contributing a set of vinyl H's.

If one substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but again, not a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to the benzene. That would be a vinyl ether, but not an ester. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. Let's say:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (ester, 3 carbons, contributes a methyl group).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (vinyl group, 2 carbons, contributes two CH2 H's).

Wait, but that would give a total of 6 +3 +2 =11 C's. So formula would be C11H... Let's count H's.

Benzene:4.

Ester:3 (methyl).

Vinyl:2 (CH2) +1 (CH) =3.

Total H's:4+3+3=10. But options have 12 or 14. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some H's. Maybe the substituent is a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), which adds three carbons. So substituents would be:

Ester: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C's).

Propenyl: CH2=CHCH2- (3 C's).

Total substituents:6 C's. Benzene is 6, so total is 12 C's, making formula C12H... So looking at options B and C.

Now, H count:

Benzene:4.

Ester:3 (methyl).

Propenyl: CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-X, where X is the ring. So, the CH2=CHCH2- group has CH2 (with 2 H's), CH (with 1 H), and CH2 (with 2 H's attached to the ring). Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So, substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent's H's: the CH2= has 2 H's, the CH has 1 H, and the CH2 attached to the ring has 2 H's. Wait, but the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-, so the CH2 attached to the ring has two H's, the CH has one H, and the CH2= has two H's.

So substituent contributes 2 (CH2=) +1 (CH) +2 (CH2-) =5 H's.

Ester contributes 3 H's (methyl).

Benzene:4.

Total H's:4+3+5=12.

Looking at the options, C12H12O2 is option C. So, that would fit if the formula is C12H12O2.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. In this case, the ester's methyl is one CH3, and the substituent is a propenyl group, which doesn't have a CH3. So that's only one CH3 signal. But the NMR shows two, so this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the substituent has another methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO- attached to the ring. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring, and another substituent is a vinyl ester. Let me think: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which adds 5 carbons (O-CO-O and ethyl), and substituent 2 is CH3 (methyl). So substituents add 5 +1=6, making total C 6+6=12. So formula would be C12H... 

H count:

Benzene:4.

Ester substituent (ethyl ester): O-CO-OCH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H's (CH2CH3 has 2+3=5).

Methyl substituent:1 C, 3 H's.

But wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is 3 C's (COO) plus 2 C's (ethyl), making 5 C's in the substituent. So, 5 C's substituent, plus benzene's 6, another substituent (CH3, 1 C), total 6+5+1=12 C's.

H count:

Benzene:4.

Ester substituent: ethyl group contributes 5 H's.

Methyl substituent:3 H's.

Total:4+5+3=12 H's. So formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. In this case, the substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH3 (which has a CH2CH3 group, contributing a triplet for the CH3 at the end) and a CH3 group attached to the ring. So, two CH3 groups: one from the ethyl ester and one from the methyl substituent. That would explain the two CH3 signals in the NMR.

The aromatic H's: in para substitution, two signals each integrating for 2 H's.

Vinyl H's: the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester, not a vinyl group. So where are the vinyl H's? Hmm, that complicates things because the NMR shows two vinyl H signals.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake there. The substituent must have a vinyl group to account for the NMR's vinyl H's. So, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester, and substituent 2 is a methyl group.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (no, that's not a vinyl). Alternatively, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is a pentyl ester. But that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (pentyl ester), which adds 6 carbons, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2, which is an ethyl ester, but that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Perhaps I should focus on the NMR signals.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H signals (likely para substituents)

- Two vinyl H signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets.

- Two CH3 signals.

So, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group, both of which bring their own CH3 groups.

For example:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (ester, contributes a CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-O-R, where R is something with a CH3.

Wait, but R can't be anything else as we're trying to keep it simple.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO- attached to the ring. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-) attached to the ring. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2-.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C's, contributes a CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH2- (3 C's, contributes a CH2 and a CH group).

So, substituents add 3+3=6 C's. Benzene is 6, total C's:12. So formula is C12H... Let's count H's.

Benzene:4.

Ester substituent:3 H's (methyl).

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring.

The substituent has:

CH2= has 2 H's.

CH has 1 H.

CH2- attached to the ring has 2 H's.

So, substituent contributes 2 +1 +2=5 H's.

Total H's:4 +3 +5 =12.

So formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second CH2. So, substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent's H's are:

The CH2= has 2 H's (a doublet, perhaps).

The CH has 1 H (could be a triplet or something else).

The CH2 attached to the ring has 2 H's (maybe as a quartet due to coupling with adjacent groups).

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the substituent's H's correspond to this.

The CH2= would have 2 H's as a doublet (coupled with the adjacent CH).

The CH would have 1 H, but perhaps it's coupled with the CH2 and another group, leading to a quartet. Or maybe the CH2 attached to the ring has 2 H's that are split into a quartet due to coupling with the vinyl CH2.

Alternatively, the substituent's structure might be more like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO- attached to the ring, but that's getting too complex.

In any case, the molecular formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. In this case, substituent 1 (ester) has a CH3, and substituent 2 (propenyl) doesn't have a CH3. So, why are there two CH3 signals? That suggests there are two different methyl groups in the molecule.

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group and substituent 1 is a vinyl ester.

So:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a longer chain, perhaps with a double bond).

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is a pentyl ester. But that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester, such as O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's even longer.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to match the options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

From earlier analysis, substituents are likely an ester and a vinyl group, leading to 11 carbons (if ester is O-CO-OCH3 and vinyl is CH2=CH-) or 12 (if substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH3 and CH2=CHCH2-).

The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, substituent 1 (ester) has a CH3, and substituent 2 must have another CH3.

Ah! So, substituent 2 is a methyl group. So, substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (ester, 3 C's) and CH3 (methyl, 1 C). So, substituents add 4 C's. Benzene is 6, so total is 10 C's. But the options don't have 10 C's.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, substituent 2 is CH(CH3)2. But that would add more C's.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CHCH(CH3)2. But that's getting too complex.

Another possibility: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) and substituent 2 is CH3 (methyl). So substituents add 3 (ester) +1 (methyl) =4 C's. Benzene is 6, so total C's 10. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) and substituent 2 is CH3. So substituents add 4 C's. Benzene:6, total 10. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. That suggests that each group is in a unique environment, so the molecule has a certain symmetry.

If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic H's would split into two signals, each integrating for 2 H's.

The vinyl H's could be from a substituent that's in a different environment from the other substituent.

The two CH3 signals suggest two different methyl groups, perhaps in different environments.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-... No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond somewhere. But that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to the benzene. But that's a vinyl ether, not an ester.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propenoate ester, which is an ester with a vinyl group. So, substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Maybe it's O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2, which would add a vinyl group to the ester.

So substituent: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2.

This substituent brings in a vinyl group (CH=CH2) as part of the ester.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2 (which is a vinyl ester), substituent 2: another group, perhaps a methyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, the ester's substituent would have a CH2CH=CH2, which doesn't have a CH3. So the other substituent must be a CH3 group.

So substituents: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2 (5 C's, since O-CO-O is 3, and CH2CH=CH2 is 3 more? No, O-CO-O is connected to CH2CH=CH2, which is 3 C's. So substituent 1 is 3 (ester) +3 (CH2CH=CH2)=6 C's. Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C). So total substituents:7 C's. Benzene is 6, so total C's 13, which isn't any option. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is really challenging. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

The correct answer is likely option C) C12H12O2 because the substituents add up to 12 carbons and the H count fits with the NMR signals, including two CH3 groups (from the ester and another substituent). But I'm not entirely confident.


To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the given spectroscopic data and molecular options systematically:

### Key Observations:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group (C=O stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹) indicates the compound contains an ester functional group.
2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic protons**: Two signals, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring with two distinct sets of aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl protons**: Two signals—one doublet and one doublet of quartets—indicating the presence of a vinyl group in a specific environment.
   - **Methyl protons**: Two signals, implying two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.
   - **No signals for CH₂ groups**: Rules out the presence of any methylene groups.

### Molecular Formula Analysis:
The compound is a di-substituted benzene (C₆H₄) with two substituents. The molecular options are:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**
- **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**
- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**
- **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degrees of unsaturation for each option were calculated:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: 6 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 from substituents).
- **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: 5 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 1 from substituents).
- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: 6 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 from substituents).
- **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: 5 degrees (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 1 from substituents).

#### Substituent Contributions:
The molecule contains:
- An ester group (O-CO-R), contributing to the oxygen count and likely a methyl or ethyl group.
- A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), contributing to the vinyl proton signals.
- Two distinct methyl groups, as indicated by the two CH₃ signals in the NMR.

### Structural Interpretation:
- The para-substituted benzene explains the two aromatic proton signals.
- The ester group accounts for the oxygen atoms and one methyl group.
- The vinyl group explains the two vinyl proton signals.
- The second methyl group must come from another substituent.

### Molecular Formula Determination:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** and **C₁₁H₁₄O₂** have 11 carbons, which would require one substituent to be a vinyl group (2 carbons) and the other an ester group (3 carbons). However, this does not account for the second methyl group without exceeding the carbon count.
- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** and **C₁₂H₁₄O₂** have 12 carbons, allowing for a vinyl group (2 carbons), an ester group (3 carbons), and another substituent (7 carbons). This aligns with the NMR data, including the two methyl groups.

### Final Answer:
The molecular formula **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** (Option C) best fits the spectroscopic data:
- Benzene contributes 6 carbons.
- The ester group contributes 3 carbons (including one methyl group).
- The vinyl group contributes 2 carbons.
- The remaining 1 carbon accounts for the second methyl group.

This matches the NMR signals (two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl) and the molecular formula.
