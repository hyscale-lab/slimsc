Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. 

So, the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait. The name might be a bit confusing. 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Because the "d" could stand for two methyl groups. So the structure would have a bromine on position 1 and two methyl groups on position 2 of the benzene ring.

Wait no, actually, the "d" probably means a double bond, but that doesn't make sense here. Alternatively, I think the "d" might be a typo or abbreviation. Another possibility is that it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but that's just a single methyl group. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that. Oh wait, the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, which is also known as bromobenzene with two methyl groups on the ortho position relative to the bromine.

So the molecule is a benzene ring with a bromine atom on carbon 1, and two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure looks like this: the bromine is attached to position 1, and positions 2 has two methyl groups. 

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic substitution reactions. Wait, but wait, in aromatic substitution, sometimes the base can abstract a proton, leading to formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's deprotonated, which can affect the substitution pattern.

Wait, another thought: in aromatic chemistry, when you have a substituent that's ortho/para directing, and you have a base, maybe an elimination occurs if there's a possibility. But 1-bromobenzene-2-d (assuming two methyl groups) would have three substituents: Br and two Me groups adjacent to each other.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of aromatic substitution. Wait, no, NaNH2 is a strong base, but in the presence of aromatic halides, what reactions occur? Oh, I think that when you have a benzene ring with a good leaving group (like Br) and a strong base, you might get a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, in aromatic substitution, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's adjacent after elimination.

Wait, another possibility: maybe this is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a source of the amide ion (NH2-), which is a good nucleophile. But nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires activating groups on the ring, like electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but the substituents here are Br and two methyl groups. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. But Br is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. So the overall effect on the ring's electron density depends on their positions.

Wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So the bromine is at position 1, and the two methyl groups are on position 2. So the substituents are all in the ortho positions relative to each other. So the ring has a Br and two Me groups on adjacent carbons.

In such a scenario, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the NH2- (amide ion) acts as a nucleophile. But for nucleophilic substitution on an aromatic ring to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. In aromatic substitution, the ring is usually electron-deficient, which is achieved by having strong electron-withdrawing groups. But methyl groups are electron-donating, so maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Another possibility is that the NaNH2 is causing elimination, but in this case, since it's on an aromatic ring, elimination would involve the loss of H and Br, but that's not possible on the ring because the ring is already conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's adjacent to the bromine.

Wait, let me think again. NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate certain positions on the ring. If the ring has acidic hydrogens, the base can abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then could lose the leaving group (Br-) in a substitution reaction.

Wait, but in this case, the bromine is on position 1, and the methyl groups are on position 2. So, where would the acidic protons be? In aromatic systems, the most acidic protons are typically those ortho and para to electron-withdrawing groups. But methyl groups are electron-donating, so maybe there's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but for that, you need an adjacent H. Wait, but the bromine is on the ring, so perhaps the adjacent H is on the benzene ring. Wait, but dehydrohalogenation typically refers to elimination reactions where a β-hydrogen is removed along with the leaving group, forming a double bond. But in this case, the ring is already conjugated, so maybe it's more about substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a benzene ring undergoing a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But for that to happen via nucleophilic substitution, the ring would need to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. The presence of two methyl groups (electron-donating) would actually deactivate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution because they make the ring more electron-rich, which is not favorable for nucleophilic attack. Unless the Br is in a position that makes the ring sufficiently activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a substitution but a elimination, but that doesn't make much sense on a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Fries rearrangement, but that's for phenyl esters. Not applicable here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond. But that's not possible because the benzene ring is already a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an NH2 group. So, in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the amide ion would substitute the bromide. But under what conditions does that happen? For nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be electron-deficient, usually with strong electron-withdrawing groups. In this molecule, the substituents are Br (which is slightly deactivating) and two methyl groups (which are activating). So the ring's electron density might not be low enough for nucleophilic substitution to occur readily.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but again, I'm not sure how that would work on an aromatic ring.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the NaNH2 is causing a rearrangement via a benzyne intermediate. Wait, benzyne is formed when a dihalobenzene loses two equivalents of HX (like HBr), forming a triple bond. But in this case, the molecule is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So, it's a monosubstituted bromide, not a disubstituted dihalide. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, then perhaps another approach. Let's think about the possible products. If the reaction is substitution, we would get 1-aminobenzene-2,2-dimethyl, but I'm not sure if the conditions favor that. Alternatively, perhaps elimination isn't possible, so the product is just the same as the starting material. But that can't be, because the question is about how many products form.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in such a way that the ring becomes more substituted. Wait, no, benzene is already a six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of para substitution.

Wait, perhaps the Br is in position 1, and the two methyl groups are in position 2. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring adjacent to the methyl groups, causing the methyl to shift positions or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. When treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the methyl groups are deprotonated. But methyl groups are not very acidic. Wait, the pKa of a methyl group is around 48, while NaNH2 has a strong enough base to deprotonate things with pKa around 35 or lower. So maybe the methyl groups can't be deprotonated under these conditions. So that's probably not happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves, but that would require a good leaving group. Br is a decent leaving group, but under what conditions would it leave? Maybe in a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the formation of a phenide ion. When a strong base like NaNH2 abstracts a proton from the benzene ring, it forms a phenide ion, which is a strong base. But where would the proton be abstracted from?

In this molecule, the substituents are Br and two Me groups. The positions that are ortho and para to the substituents are potential sites for deprotonation. Let me imagine the structure:

Positions are 1 (Br), 2 (two Me), 3 (H?), 4 (H?), 5 (H?), 6 (H?).

Wait, but in benzene, each carbon has one H unless substituted. So, in 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, positions 1 has Br, position 2 has two Me groups, so positions 3, 4, 5, 6 have H.

The positions adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has two Me groups, so position 6 has H. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br. Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 5. Alternatively, position 3 is meta to Br.

Wait, in such a case, the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton where the ring is most activated. Since Br is deactivating, the positions ortho and para to Br are less activated. But the two methyl groups are activating (ortho/para directors), so their presence would direct incoming nucleophiles to their ortho and para positions.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has two methyl groups on position 2, which is adjacent to Br (position 1). So, the methyl groups are ortho to Br. So, the substituents on the ring are Br (position 1), Me (position 2), and Me (position 2 again). So, the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H.

Now, when NaNH2 is added, the NH2- would act as a base. The most acidic protons on the ring would be those that are ortho and para to the substituents. The Br is a deactivating group, so its ortho and para positions are less likely to have acidic protons. But the methyl groups are activating, so their ortho and para positions are more acidic.

So, in the ring, the methyl groups are at position 2. Their ortho positions would be position 1 (Br) and position 3. Para would be position 6. So, position 3 and 6 are ortho and para to the methyl groups. So, the H at position 6 is ortho to Br and para to methyl. The H at position 3 is ortho to methyl.

So, the base could abstract a proton from either position 3 or position 6. Let's think about that.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then the ring would have a negative charge at position 3. Alternatively, if it abstracts from position 6, the negative charge would be at position 6.

Wait, but how does that lead to substitution? So, after deprotonation, the ring has a benzene ring with Br at position 1, two Me at 2, and a negative charge at either 3 or 6, then maybe the Br leaves as Br- and the ring becomes a benzene ring with an NH2 group.

Wait, but that's substitution. So, if the base abstracts a proton and the Br leaves, you would get a substitution product where NH2- attacks the ring where the Br was. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's adjacent to the Br, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Upon treatment with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge next to Br. Then, the Br would leave as Br-, and the ring would form a new bond with the NH2- group.

Wait, but for that to happen, the base would have to abstract a proton that's adjacent (β position) to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, the benzene ring is already conjugated, so that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction where the Br and a H are removed, but again, that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an NH2 group. But the question is whether this substitution is feasible under the given conditions.

Another thought: when a benzene ring has a substituent that's a leaving group, and a strong base is present, sometimes the ring can undergo elimination to form a diene. But I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with the NH2 group in different positions. So, substitution can occur in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, but if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, and we substitute Br with NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene. But wait, is that the only product?

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 4, which is para to the methyl groups, leading to a different substitution site. Or maybe deprotonation occurs at position 3, leading to substitution at position 3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substitution would occur where the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then would have the Br- leave. So, the substitution would be at the same position where the proton was abstracted.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The substitution occurs at the position of the leaving group (Br), so perhaps the position where the base abstracts the proton doesn't directly influence the substitution site.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation and elimination lead to a shift in substituents. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the NH2- replaces the Br. But for that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. The substituents here are Br (a deactivating group) and two methyl (activating) groups. The overall effect is that the ring is less activated than without the methyl groups, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the question is about products.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond (an alkyne?), but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's adjacent to where the Br was, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products.

If the reaction is substitution, then the Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene.

But wait, could there be more than one product? For example, steric effects might lead to different regiochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to the methyl groups, leading to substitution at position 4. But wait, the Br is at position 1, so that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The reaction is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, which is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation in aliphatic compounds, but for aromatic rings, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a benzidine rearrangement, but that's for different structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a phenide ion, which then reacts with Br-.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to the methyl groups on position 2. That would create a phenide ion at position 4. Then, the Br- would leave, and the phenide would attack the adjacent position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is ortho to the methyl groups. Then, the phenide would form, and the Br leaves, leading to substitution at position 1, but that's where the Br was.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw this out mentally.

The structure is:

Positions:

1: Br

2: Me, Me

3: H

4: H

5: H

6: H

So, the ring looks like:

Br is at position 1.

At position 2, two methyl groups are attached.

So, the adjacent positions are 6 and 2. Position 2 is taken by methyl, so position 6 is H.

The next positions are 3,4,5,6.

Which positions are acidic enough for the base to abstract a proton?

The methyl groups are activating, so the positions ortho and para to them would be more acidic.

Each methyl group is at position 2, so their ortho positions are 1 and 3, and their para positions are 5 and 6, but wait, para is across the ring. So, for a methyl at position 2, the para position is position 6. So, position 6 is activated by the methyl group. Similarly, position 3 is ortho to the methyl group.

So, the protons at position 3 and 6 are more acidic.

So the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton from either position 3 or 6.

Case 1: Base abstracts H from position 3.

Then, the ring would have a negative charge at position 3. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br-, creating a ring with a negative charge at position 1. Wait, but that might not be stable. Alternatively, the ring would have a double bond between position 1 and 2, but that's already a benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the ring would form a more stabilized structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs where the base abstracts the proton, leading to substitution at that position.

Wait, no. Substitution would occur at the position where the Br was, but with a change in substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes more activated in certain positions, leading to different substitution products.

Wait, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with an amino group at position 1 (where Br was), but that doesn't make sense because the Br would have to leave, and the substitution would occur.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question suggests that products are formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with an amino group in position 3 or 6.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then the ring could form a bond with the NH2 group at position 3, but that would require the loss of Br-.

Wait, no, substitution typically occurs at the position of the leaving group. So if Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then perhaps the substitution occurs at position 1, but that doesn't change the position. So maybe the product is just 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene.

But then, why would there be multiple products? Because the base could abstract a proton from either position 3 or position 6, leading to different substitution positions. But substitution occurs where the Br was, so perhaps the product is the same regardless.

Wait, that can't be right. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is para to the methyl group, then the substitution would still be at position 1. So the product would be the same in both cases.

Hmm, so maybe only one product forms. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 4, which is para to the bromine, but that would require the ring to be activated there.

Wait, but the Br is a deactivating group, so position 4 (para to Br) is less activated. So the proton there is less acidic, so perhaps not abstracted under these conditions.

So, perhaps only positions 3 and 6 are possible for deprotonation, leading to substitution at position 1. Thus, the product would be 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene, but that's a single product.

But wait, is there any possibility of multiple regioisomers forming? For example, substitution at position 1 gives only one product, but perhaps if the substituents are arranged differently, like if the amino group can be in different positions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deprotonation and substitution can occur in such a way that the amino group ends up in different positions relative to the methyl groups, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, substitution occurs at position 1, where Br was. So the product would have NH2 at position 1 and two Me groups at position 2. That's a single product.

Wait, but what if the base abstracts a proton from position 4? Then, the substitution would occur at position 1, but the amino group would be at 1, and the methyl groups at 2. So again, same product.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure again.

Wait, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a benzene ring that's more reactive, and the Br leaves, allowing the NH2 group to attack in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a diradical or some intermediate that can form different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination, forming a benzene ring with a substituent in a different position.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe the correct answer is that only one product forms. So the option would be B) 1.

But wait, the options are:

A)4

B)1

C)2

D)3

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product due to different sites of deprotonation and substitution.

Wait, if the base can abstract a proton from either position 3 or position 6, but substitution occurs at position 1, then the product would be the same. So only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at position 1, but the structure could result in different products based on the position of the amino group relative to methyl groups.

Wait, but in this case, the amino group is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at position 2. So that's a single product.

But wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution, but instead, the methyl groups are somehow involved in the reaction. For example, maybe the base abstracts a proton from a methyl group, but as I thought earlier, methyl groups are not acidic enough under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile, leading to substitution. But as I thought earlier, the ring isn't activated enough for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and the substituents are such that the ring is activated in a certain way. Let me think: Br is a deactivating group (meta director), and the two methyl groups are activating (ortho/para directors). So the overall directing effect would depend on their positions.

At position 1 (Br) and position 2 (two Me), the activating groups (Me) are ortho to Br. So the ring's electron density is higher in the regions activated by the Me groups. So the NH2- might attack at the para position to the Me groups, which is position 6.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2- attacks at position 4, which is para to the Me groups.

Wait, but substitution typically occurs where the leaving group is. So the Br is at position 1. So substitution would occur at position 1, regardless of where the activating groups are.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for similar reactions or mechanisms in my notes.

Wait, another approach: the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it undergoes a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced by NH2. But I'm not sure about the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of elimination, but on the aromatic ring, elimination isn't straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about forming aniline derivatives. So the substitution product would be 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene. That's one product.

But could there be other products? For example, could the NH2 group end up in a different position, like position 3 or 4?

Wait, no, because the substitution occurs where the Br is, which is position 1. So the product should be the same regardless of where the base abstracts a proton.

Wait, but maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 3 or 6, leading to different intermediates, but the substitution occurs at position 1, so the product is the same.

Therefore, only one product is formed. So the correct answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2,2-dimethyl (1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or substitution reactions. The structure of the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Conditions**: NaNH₂ acts as a base, potentially abstracting acidic protons from the benzene ring or facilitating substitution. The reaction conditions favor deprotonation and substitution, but nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires an electron-deficient ring, which is not strongly activated in this case due to the electron-donating methyl groups.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Bromine (Br) is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - Methyl groups (Me) are electron-donating, activating, and ortho/para-directing.
   - The overall electron density of the ring is influenced by these substituents, with the methyl groups making certain positions more acidic.

3. **Deprotonation**:
   - The acidic protons ortho and para to the methyl groups (positions 3 and 6) are more likely to be abstracted by the base. However, substitution occurs at the position of the leaving group (Br at position 1), not necessarily where deprotonation occurs.

4. **Substitution**:
   - The bromine atom at position 1 is replaced by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), leading to the formation of 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene as the primary product.

5. **Possible Products**:
   - Substitution occurs exclusively at position 1, where the bromine is located. There is no evidence for multiple regioisomers or alternative substitution sites under these conditions. Thus, only one product forms.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces a single product, 1-amino-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.
