Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go slowly.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts, their integrals add up to 1H, and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down the observations.

First, the NMR part. Normally, each proton should give a single peak, but here there are two. The integrals together are 1H, so each is half. Also, the shifts are similar, so it's not like one is a completely different environment. The coupling pattern suggests it's not because of coupling with neighboring protons. So, what other possibilities are there for duplicate peaks?

I remember that sometimes when there's a diastereomer, the protons might split into different peaks because of different environments. But wait, if it's enantiomers, wouldn't the NMR peaks look the same because enantiomers have the same physical environment for protons? Oh, right, enantiomers don't split each other's signals because they're mirror images. So if it were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak, not two. So options B and D are about enantiomers and diastereomers. So if it's enantiomers, why two peaks? I think diastereomers would have different shifts, but here the shifts are similar. Hmm.

Another thought: could there be some kind of splitting due to something else, like exchange or something? Or maybe there's an issue with the synthesis, like incomplete reaction leading to some byproduct. But the question says it's an NMR of the crude compound, so there might be other components.

Wait the LC-MS part. The LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So, same molecular weight. But in a pure sample, you should get one peak. Two peaks of same mass but with same intensity and same mass spectrum. Oh, wait, same mass but different retention times? Or same retention time? No, LC shows two peaks, so different retention times, but same mass. So they are two different species with the same molecular weight. Wait, but same mass and same mass spectrum, so same molecular formula. So what kind of compounds have the same mass but are different? They could be isomers, like diastereomers or enantiomers. Because enantiomers have the same mass and same mass spec.

Wait, but in LC, enantiomers would typically elute at the same time unless the column is chiral. But the question says LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks. If it's a regular column, enantiomers would come out together, giving a single peak. So if the LC shows two peaks, that suggests they're not enantiomers. Because if it's a chiral column, it would separate them, but the question doesn't mention that. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. If the compound is a diastereomer, then they'd have different physical properties, so different retention times. But if it's a racemic mixture, they'd come out together unless the column is chiral. So, for racemic, same retention time, so same peak. But the question says two peaks, so more likely diastereomers.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks for the same alpha proton. If it's diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons, but they could have similar shifts. But in that case, each diastereomer would have their own set of peaks. Wait, but the NMR is a mixture, so if the sample is a mixture of diastereomers, you would see more than just two peaks for each proton. Because each diastereomer would have a different environment, so each proton would split into two, perhaps more.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks in the NMR are from two different conformers. But wait, conformers usually interconvert, so unless the molecule is really rigid, but then the peaks would be broad or split. Also, coupling doesn't fit in this case.

Wait, the problem says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not splitting due to neighboring protons. So what else? Maybe there's some kind of exchange happening, but that's more of a dynamic process, not a static splitting.

Another possibility: perhaps the compound is a mixture of tautomers. But tautomers would have different mass, I think, because they involve exchange of hydrogens and other atoms. But the mass spectrum is the same, so same molecular weight. So that's not it.

Wait, looking back at the options. Option C says 'double coupling' during an amide bond forming reaction. What's that? Maybe during the formation of the amide, perhaps an intermediate where two different couplings happen, leading to two protons. Not sure. Or perhaps the amide bonds have some double bonds or something that cause coupling. Not entirely sure about this option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The LC-MS would show different masses. But here, both peaks have same mass as expected, so it's not a precursor. So A is unlikely.

So options are between B, C, D. Let's think again.

In the NMR, two peaks for the same alpha-H. So perhaps the molecule has some kind of symmetry or some diastereomerism. But if it's a diastereomer, each would have its own set of protons. But in the NMR, the integral is 1H for both, so perhaps each diastereomer contributes a proton with similar shift.

But the problem is the LC-MS. If the compound is a diastereomer mixture, then the LC would show two peaks. So in that case, the NMR would see a mixture, thus each proton in each diastereomer would have a different shift. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe the diastereomers are very similar in the environment of that proton, perhaps only one proton is different.

Wait, but diastereomers would have different environments for most protons. But maybe if the diastereomers are enantiomers in a certain part, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a mixture of epimers. Epimers are diastereomers that differ only in the configuration of one stereocenter. So if the molecule has two stereocenters, but only one is varying, then the other protons would have similar shifts.

Wait, but if the molecule has two stereocenters, but in the alpha position (the one with the proton in question), perhaps the configuration is different.

Wait, but if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not split the peaks. So I'm back to thinking that perhaps the molecule has more than one stereocenter, and some of them are not formed correctly.

But wait, the question says in the NMR, the integral adds to 1H, so for each diastereomer, the alpha-H is present. So for example, if there are two diastereomers, each would have one alpha-H, so in the NMR, their peaks would add up. Hmm, but the shifts are similar, so the environments are almost the same. So maybe only one stereocenter is causing the difference, and the rest of the molecule is the same.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a mixture of two diastereomers that are mirror images in some way, leading to similar shifts. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight, so same formula. So the only way is that they are isomers. Either enantiomers or diastereomers.

But in LC, if they're enantiomers, unless the column is chiral, they would co-elute. But the question says that the LC-MS shows two peaks, so they must be separated. Which suggests that the column is chiral, leading to separation of enantiomers. But the question doesn't mention a chiral column. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a polar versus non-polar thing, but same mass would require same formula.

Wait, but the question says that the LC-MS was done 'at elevated temperature'. Could that cause something to happen, like the compounds being in different conformations? Or maybe some other effect. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are not the same, but due to something else. But the question says they have same mass, so same molecular formula.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a dimer or something, but the mass would be double. So that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D says mixture of diastereoisomers. If they are diastereomers, the NMR would show different shifts for each proton in each isomer. But the problem states that two peaks for the same alpha-proton have similar shifts. So perhaps the two diastereomers have that alpha proton in a similar environment. Maybe only one stereocenter is different, so the alpha proton's environment is not too different.

Also, the LC-MS would separate them because they're diastereomers, so different physical properties.

So if it's a mixture of two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons, but the alpha-proton in each has a similar shift. So in the NMR, you'd see two peaks integrating to 1H each (but together 2H?), no, wait. Wait the problem says the two peaks together integrate to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H. Because the two diastereomers each have the same alpha proton, perhaps. Or maybe each diastereomer has one of them, but the shift is the same.

Wait, maybe each diastereomer has one alpha proton, but the shifts are similar, so each contributes a peak. So the integral would be 1H total.

Wait, but for diastereomers, if each has one alpha proton, then in a 50:50 mix, each proton would split into two peaks, each with 0.5H. So, yeah, that would account for two peaks adding up to 1H.

And in the LC-MS, each diastereomer would elute at a different time, same mass, same mass spec (since same formula), so two peaks of same area.

So this seems to fit the observations.

What about the coupling? Since it's a diastereomer, each diastereomer would have their own coupling. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So maybe each peak is a doublet or something else. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, but the problem says that based on the coupling, it's not spin-spin. So the two peaks aren't due to coupling between protons, but perhaps another reason.

Another possibility is that the two peaks are due to a double bond or something, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another thought: what if the molecule is a mixture of two different diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton environment, but different elsewhere. So their alpha protons are similar but come from different molecules. But why would the coupling rule out spin-spin? Maybe because each diastereomer's alpha protons are not coupled to the same neighboring protons.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but let's think about the options again.

Option D says diastereomers. That seems to explain the LC-MS part. And the NMR part could be because each diastereomer contributes a similar peak for the same proton. So the two peaks sum to 1H, each is 0.5H.

Another option is Option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe some kind of coupling that leads to two different environments for the same proton. But I'm not familiar with this term. It could be a reaction where the proton is coupled in two different ways, but I'm not sure.

If it's C, then the NMR would show two peaks, but the LC-MS would have only one peak because it's the same compound. But the LC-MS shows two peaks, so the same mass. So C seems less likely because the LC-MS would show two if it's a different compound.

Wait, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of the same mass. So it's the same compound but in different forms. So for C, if it's a double coupling during amide bond formation, maybe it's forming a different structure, but same mass. So that could explain the same mass. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the amide bond is not formed correctly, leading to some kind of isomer. But again, I'm not sure.

So between D and C, I'm more inclined towards D. Because the same mass suggests same formula, and diastereomers fit that. Plus, the NMR of a diastereomer mixture would have two peaks for the same proton if the environments are similar enough and the two diastereomers contribute equally.

Wait, but if it's a diastereomer, then the other protons would also split into multiple peaks. But the question says the NMR otherwise appears consistent, so maybe only the alpha proton is split. Hmm, that's possible if only the configuration around the alpha carbon is different, and the rest is the same. So the other protons would have the same shifts. But that seems unlikely unless only one stereocenter is different.

Wait, but in a peptide, the alpha carbon is a stereocenter. So if the synthesis led to a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would not split because of the symmetry. But the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton, which would not be the case for enantiomers because the chemical shifts would be the same. But here, the shifts are similar, not the same. So maybe it's not a racemic mixture.

Wait, but the NMR is for the crude compound. So perhaps the synthesis went wrong and instead of getting a single stereoisomer, it got a mixture.

So, going back, the most likely answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Because the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, which suggests same formula. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, suggesting that the environment is similar but split into two. So, the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton in similar environments but not identical.

I think that's the best fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (summing to 1H), and no spin-spin coupling. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggest a split in the signal, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (0.5H each).
   - The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the split.
   - The presence of two peaks for the same proton indicates a difference in the local environment of the proton, likely due to stereoisomerism.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum suggest the presence of two species with the same molecular formula but different physical properties (e.g., diastereomers or enantiomers).
   - If the LC-MS column were chiral, enantiomers would separate, but the question does not specify a chiral column. Thus, the two peaks are more likely due to diastereomers, which naturally have different retention times due to differing physical properties.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **(A) Contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor would have a different mass, which contradicts the LC-MS data showing the same mass for both peaks. This option is unlikely.
   - **(B) Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers have identical chemical environments for protons, so the NMR would show a single peak for each proton. Additionally, LC-MS would not separate enantiomers unless a chiral column is used, which is not mentioned. This option is unlikely.
   - **(C) 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation**: This term is unclear and typically refers to a reaction-specific phenomenon. However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks of the same mass, indicating the same molecular formula, which would not result from double coupling. This option is unlikely.
   - **(D) Mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereomers have the same molecular formula but different physical properties, leading to different retention times in LC-MS. In NMR, the alpha-proton environment can differ slightly between diastereomers, resulting in two peaks with similar shifts. The integral of 1H (0.5H each) suggests a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers. This explanation fits both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS analyses.
