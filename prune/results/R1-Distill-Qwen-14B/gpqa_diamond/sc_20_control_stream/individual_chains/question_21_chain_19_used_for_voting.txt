Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me read it again.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

I remember that tautomerism has to do with the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, a compound must have both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group adjacent to it, so that the hydrogen can shift.

Looking at part A first. Let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone oxygens. Wait, no, benzoquinone is more like a benzene ring with two double bonds, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups. Oh wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in a diketone structure. So it's O=C6H4=O or something similar. So it's a cyclic diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So it's a six-membered ring with three ketones opposite each other, like every other carbon has a carbonyl.

Now, tautomerism. Let me think. Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen can shift from an -OH group to a carbonyl group, converting between a keto and enol form. For that, the compound needs both an -OH and a carbonyl adjacent to each other. 

So benzoquinone: Each ketone is at positions 1 and 2 (if it's para) or 1 and 4 (ortho or meta?) Wait, no, benzoquinone is either para or ortho. Wait, I think benzoquinone is a para-diketone, so the two ketones are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4. So each is a C=O group. Are they adjacent? No, they're opposite. So each carbonyl is a C=O, but there are no hydroxyl groups. Wait, no, wait: benzoquinone is O=C-C6H2-C(=O)-O. No, wait, that's not right. Maybe it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, for example, 1,4-benzoquinone would have two ketones across from each other.

But in either case, Benzoquinone has two ketone groups but no hydroxyl groups. So, without an -OH adjacent to a carbonyl, can it undergo tautomerism? I don't think so. Because tautomerism requires the transfer of a hydrogen from an -OH to a carbonyl. If there's no -OH group, then no keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't have any -OH groups; it's all C=O. So it can't undergo tautomerism. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, maybe benzoquinone is an enol form. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let's think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane. Each is opposite each other. So, each C=O is on carbons 1,3,5. So each is adjacent to other carbonyls. Wait, so in this molecule, maybe there are -OH groups. Because, wait, can any of the carbonyls act as -OH?

Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are all ketones, so they can't lose a proton because they're ketones. Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a keto group and an enol group. The enol form has a double bond and an -OH. So, say, if a compound has a C=O and a C-OH next to it, it can tautomerize.

But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is adjacent to other ketones. Let me visualize the structure. The cyclohexane ring has three carbonyl groups alternating with CH2 groups. So at each of the 1,3,5 positions, there's a C=O, and the 2,4,6 positions are CH2. So, each C=O is between two CH2 groups. So, could any of the CH2 groups have an -OH? No, because the structure is all C=O and CH2.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the structure. If the molecule is 1,3,5-trione, then it's O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C- arranged in a ring? No, wait, each position is a carbon. So, in the ring, positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, and 2,4,6 are CH2. So each C=O is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, the CH2 groups are in between the carbonyls. So, any of those CH2 groups can't be an -OH, because they're CH2. So, in that case, there's no -OH group attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. So, can that compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, no. Because tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, if the molecule has a hydroxyl group next to a ketone, that's when tautomerism can occur. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the CH2 groups are between the ketones. So, each C=O is between two CH2 groups. So, the CH2 groups are not -OH. Therefore, there's no possibility for tautomerism because there's no -OH group adjacent to a carbonyl in either compound.

Wait, but wait. What about benzoquinone? Let me think again. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Are there any positions where a hydroxyl could form or is present? Or, perhaps, in benzoquinone, is there any possibility for enol tautomerism?

Wait, another thought. Quinones are known for their resonance structures. Benzoquinone can exist in different forms due to keto-enol tautomerism. If benzoquinone has a conjugated enol form, it might show tautomerism. Let me visualize it.

Benzoquinone: It's O=C6H4=O. So, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. But in some cases, quinones can have enol tautomers. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are opposite each other. The molecule can lose two protons and form a conjugated enol. So, the structure would have two double bonds and a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe. So, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the trione can't. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each carbonyl is in the ring, with CH2 groups in between. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- in a ring. So, each C=O is flanked by CH2 groups. So, the CH2 groups are not OH groups. So, there's no adjacent H to a carbonyl to allow for tautomerism. Therefore, this compound can't tautomerize.

But benzoquinone: If it has two ketones, but perhaps, in some positions, there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, no. In the benzene ring, each C=O is attached to a carbon which is connected to other carbons. So, the carbons adjacent to C=O are each connected to two other carbons in the ring, and perhaps have a hydrogen. Wait, if the structure is O=C6H4=O, then each C=O is attached to two CH groups.

So, each C=O is at positions 1 and 4. So, the adjacent carbons (2 and 6 for C1, and 3 and 5 for C4) are each CH groups. So, each has a hydrogen attached. So, maybe the H on carbon 2 is adjacent to the C=O at 1. So, could that H be involved in tautomerism? Because it's adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, tautomerism usually involves a hydrogen moving from an -OH group to a carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, that's keto-enol tautomerism. So, in a compound with a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group on an adjacent carbon, the H from the hydroxyl can move to the carbonyl carbon, converting the keto form to the enol form.

But in benzoquinone, there's no -OH group. So, that can't happen. So benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it lacks the hydroxyl group. Therefore, which of the two compounds can't tautomerize? Benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also doesn't? Or wait, maybe I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen and a carbonyl that can shift. So, for example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, perhaps one of the carbonyls is adjacent to a CH group, which can lose a hydrogen, leading to a shift. But wait, without an -OH, how would that happen?

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the trione can undergo some kind of tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are conjugated. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for examples. Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a symmetrical molecule with three carbonyl groups. I don't recall it undergoing tautomerism. On the other hand, benzoquinone can tautomerize perhaps because it's a conjugated system, but without an -OH. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe benzoquinone can't.

Wait, what's the structure of each?

Benzoquinone: It's benzene with two ketone groups. So, O=C-C6H4-C(=O)-O? No, wait, it's O=C6H4=O. So, it's a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups para to each other. So, each of those carbonyls is at C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C3, for example) are CH groups. So, each has a hydrogen attached. But without an -OH group, how would tautomerism occur?

Wait, perhaps in some cases, the H can be abstracted. Let me think: In the keto form, you have C=O groups. If a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon were to shift, would that form an enol? But that would require the adjacent carbon to have a hydrogen, which it does, but without a hydroxyl group, how would the hydrogen transfer happen?

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Tautomerism is the transfer of a hydrogen from an -OH group to a carbonyl. So, without an -OH, you can't have that process. Therefore, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione don't have -OH groups, so neither can undergo tautomerism. But wait, that can't be right because the question states that one of them does not show tautomerism. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe one of the compounds can tautomerize despite the lack of an -OH. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Maybe in some cases, the structure allows for the formation of enol without an -OH group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them has the appropriate substituents.

Wait, perhaps the trione can tautomerize. Let me think about another compound. For example, cyclohexanone. It can't tautomerize because it's a ketone, but if there's an -OH adjacent, like in some cyclic ketones, then it can. But in this case, the trione doesn't have any -OH groups, so it can't.

Hmm. So, maybe neither of them can, but the question says one of them doesn't. So perhaps the answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, but why? Because it's a trione, perhaps it's too stable. Alternatively, perhaps it's because it doesn't have the necessary -OH group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial part of the question. The first part is asking which compound doesn't show tautomerism. So, the options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, if both can't show tautomerism, then that's a problem. But the options suggest that one of them is the correct answer for A.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about benzoquinone. Let's think: Can benzoquinone tautomerize? I think I've heard that para-benzoquinone can exist in keto and enol forms. Wait, but without an -OH group, how? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of tautomerism. Wait, maybe it's a case of aromatic tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom from a position adjacent to a carbonyl group to another position, leading to the conversion between keto and enol forms. So, for that, the molecule must have a structure where a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl can move to the carbonyl carbon, forming a double bond.

In benzoquinone, each C=O is between two CH groups. So, each has H attached. So, perhaps the H on C2 can move to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), resulting in a ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. Wait, but without an -OH, how? Maybe the H is abstracted, leading to a ring with a double bond and a negative charge, which isn't stable. So, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because it doesn't have an -OH group.

Wait, perhaps the trione can. Let me think: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each C=O is between CH2 groups. So, perhaps one of the CH2 groups can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond. But that would require a transition state where the hydrogen is moving, but without an -OH, that's not possible. So, perhaps neither can tautomerize. But again, the question implies one does and the other doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about benzoquinone. If it's in a solution, perhaps it can undergo some kind of resonance or tautomerism. For example, maybe the carbonyl groups can rotate, but that's more about resonance than tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the two carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow for hydrogen transfer. Whereas the trione, with three carbonyls spaced around the ring, might have a position where a hydrogen can shift.

Wait, perhaps the trione can't tautomerize because all carbonyls are equivalent and symmetrically arranged, so there's no possible site for hydrogen transfer. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the trione can tautomerize, but benzoquinone can't. That would make A = benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So, which is it?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for similar structures. For example, cyclohexanone can't tautomerize because it's a simple ketone without an adjacent -OH. But if a compound has multiple ketones, perhaps it can't. So, maybe neither of them can, but the question implies one can't. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize. Let me think: Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. If a hydrogen from one of the adjacent CH groups can move to a carbonyl carbon, forming an enol structure. But without a hydroxyl group, where would the hydrogen go? Maybe it forms a conjugated dienol structure? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione can't because all the CH2 groups are between the carbonyls, and thus can't form an enol structure. So, both can't tautomerize, but that's not possible because the question states that one doesn't.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should move on to part B and come back.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, it can arise from other forms of chirality, like axial chirality, but that's less common.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write its structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, the structure is O

       O
       ||
CH3-O-C-O-C(H)(OH)-CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait. No, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Let me correct that.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But wait, in the ester, the -OH of the acid is replaced by OCH3. So, the structure should be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbon chain is:

CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, that's not right. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, look for chiral centers. The carbon with the OH is the second carbon (CH2(OH)). Let me see: The groups attached to that carbon are:

- CH2COOCH3 (the rest of the molecule)
- OH
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons. The carboxylic acid is at carbon 3. So, carbon 1: CH3O-CO-O-, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: CH(OH), carbon 4: CH2?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So, the ester would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the ester structure: the central carbon (the second carbon) has the groups:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. The second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to see it as:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let me clearly list the groups:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 (connected to carbon 1 and 3)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

So, the central CH2 is connected to:

- HO-CH2-
- CH2-CO-O-CH3.

Wait, so the CH2 in the middle (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: HO-CH2-
- Carbon 3: CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two CH2 groups (from either side? No, because it's a chain: H2C-CH2-CO-OCH3).

Wait, no, the molecule is: HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the second carbon (the CH2 in the middle) is connected to:

- HO-CH2-
- CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, the second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

Groups attached to the second carbon (CH2):

1. The CH2OH group (from carbon 1)
2. The CH2COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
3. Two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each carbon in a CH2 group has two H's. So, the second carbon is connected to:

- One CH2OH group (carbon 1)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (carbon 3)
- Two H atoms.

So, the four substituents are: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and H. Wait, but that means two H's. So, the substituents are not all different. Therefore, the second carbon is not a chiral center because it has two H's. So, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the third carbon is the chiral center. Let me see: The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon. So, the third carbon is CH2 connected to COOCH3. So, its substituents are:

- CH2OH
- CH2CH2 (from carbon 2)
- COOCH3
- H.

Wait, no. The third carbon is CH2 connected to COOCH3. So, the groups are:

- CH2OH (from carbon 2)
- CH3-O-CO (from the ester)
- Two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: HO-CH2-
2: CH2-
3: COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

- HO-CH2- (carbon 1)
- CH2- (carbon 3)
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center.

Hmm. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. So, does that mean it doesn't show optical isomerism? But wait, maybe there's another possibility. Wait, what about the ester group? The ester is OCH3, which is a substituent, but the carbonyl is a double bond. So, maybe the central CH2 isn't a chiral center.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with two double bonds. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. The dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no, because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, I think I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the structure is trans-butenedioic acid. So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2(COOCH3)2? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle.

Wait, more accurately, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, no, wait: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is a trans-dioic acid. So, the dimethyl ester is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the central part is CH=CH, with the two ester groups on either end.

Now, considering chirality. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of chirality like axial chirality. In this case, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side.

Let me look at the double bond in dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. The double bond is between the two CH groups. So, each CH is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3O groups? Wait, no.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on one side.
- Another COOCH3 group on the other side?

No, wait, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me better draw the structure.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on one side.
- Another COOCH3 group on the other side.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end.

Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen. So, each CH has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would have each -COOH converted to -COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is (CH2(COOCH3))CH=CH(CH2(COOCH3))? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. But that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, not fumarate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Fumarate has a structure with a double bond between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, but that can't be right because each carbon can't have four bonds. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- One COOCH3 group on each side.

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end, and two H's.

So, each CH has:

- CH2(COOCH3) on one side and CH2(COOCH3) on the other, but with a double bond in between.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond has two substituents on each carbon. The substituents on each CH are:

- COOCH3 on both sides.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

So, each CH has four substituents: two COOCH3, two H's. But that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, perhaps each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end, and two H's.

Wait, that's possible. So, each CH is attached to:

- One COOCH3 on the left and right, and two H's.

But in that case, the molecule would be symmetrical, so no chirality.

Wait, no, because the substituents are arranged in a certain way around the double bond. Let's think about the configuration around the double bond.

In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. But wait, that's not possible because that would require each carbon to have four bonds, which it does.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. So, that's not fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the possibility of optical isomerism in dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate has a structure with a double bond and two ester groups on either end. The arrangement around the double bond could lead to E/Z isomerism, but E and Z are about the arrangement around the double bond and don't directly cause optical isomerism. Unless the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but fumarate is trans; that is, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is trans, making the molecule symmetrical. So, in that case, does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making it a meso compound. So, the molecule is symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Fumarate is trans, and maleate is cis. So, in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical, and thus, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, it can't be chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, but that can't be right because dimethyl fumarate is used as an example of a compound with optical isomerism in some contexts. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me check the structure again.

Wait, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the carbons are:

Carbonyl-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
Carbonyl-OCH3

No, that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the two CH groups are connected by a double bond, and each has a COOCH3 group.

So, each CH is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end.

Wait, that's not possible because each CH can only have four bonds. Let me think of each CH as having:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, but that's not possible because each CH can only have four bonds. So, each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group, one CH (double bond), and two H's.

Ah, that makes sense.

So, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- CH (double bond)
- Two H's.

So, each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH (double bond)
- H
- H.

Wait, no, that's not possible because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH (double bond)
- Two H's.

So, each CH has substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond to the other CH.

In this case, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3 (one substituent)
- H (two substituents)
- The double bond (which is between the two CH groups).

So, each CH has three substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. Wait, but that's four bonds, right? So, each CH is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- The double bond to the other CH.

So, each CH has four bonds, which works.

Now, the molecule is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the two CH groups are each attached to a COOCH3 and two H's, and connected by a double bond. The question is, is this molecule chiral?

For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or another form of chirality.

In this case, the molecule has a central double bond with two identical groups on each side. Each CH has a COOCH3 and two H's. So, the substituents on each CH are:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Double bond to the other CH.

So, each CH is symmetric because the substituents are the same on both sides. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because fumarate is a trans-dioic acid, and its ester would retain that structure. So, perhaps I'm missing something about the symmetry.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, then it's meso, and thus not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and two H's. So, each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Double bond to the other CH.

So, the substituents on each CH are the same: COOCH3, H, H. So, each CH is not a chiral center because it has two H's. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, and thus, doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, that means both methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate don't show optical isomerism, which can't be the case because the question implies one does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again.

The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, meaning it's not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing another possibility. What about the ester group? The ester is OCH3, but that's a single group attached to the carbonyl, not a chiral center.

Hmm. So, neither of them shows optical isomerism? That can't be right because the question states that one of them does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. Maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each CH are not the same.

Wait, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, each CH is attached to COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each CH has the same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism.

But that can't be right because I thought fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, which is cis. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate (trans) has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is meso and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is confusing. So, both compounds don't show optical isomerism? That can't be the case because the question implies one does.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, the ester is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but that would be a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- HO-CH2-
- CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. Therefore, not a chiral center.

Wait, but what about the third carbon? The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon. So, substituents on the third carbon:

- CH2-CH2OH
- COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, the third carbon is CH2, so it can't be a chiral center.

Hmm. So, maybe neither of the compounds shows optical isomerism, but the question states one does. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another possibility. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, which would create a chiral center. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to have optical isomerism. Wait, perhaps in the case of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the ester group is attached to a carbon that's a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the carbons are:

1: CH2OH
2: CH2
3: COOCH3.

So, carbon 2 is connected to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, not a chiral center.

Hmm. So, perhaps I'm stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate. Let me think differently. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. The central double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, but that would mean each CH has four substituents: two COOCH3, two H's. So, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 and two H's. So, the substituents are same on each side, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it's a meso compound and not chiral.

So, neither of the two compounds shows optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the question says one of them does.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, not a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the COOCH3 group is attached to a chiral center. Let me look at the third carbon. The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon, which is connected to:

- CH2CH2OH
- COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. The third carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from the ester and the CH2OH)
- Two H's.

No, that's not correct. The third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, which is a carbonyl, so it's double-bonded to O. So, the third carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded and thus can't be a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look up what I can remember. I think that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a meso compound. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism. Therefore, looking back at the options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

Wait, if part A is which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Let's think again.

If benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone. So, options B and D have A as benzoquinone.

If part B is which compound shows optical isomerism, but I thought neither did. But according to the options, the answer for B must be either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again: If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central CH2 is attached to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's. Not a chiral center.

But wait, what if the structure is different? Suppose the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester. Then, the carbon with the OH would have substituents:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H.

So, four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would show optical isomerism.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which is 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H.

So, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes sense. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Earlier, I thought it's a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism. So, in that case, the correct answer would be that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, going back to part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism. If the trione can't tautomerize, then A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about whether benzoquinone can tautomerize. But according to my latest thought, since methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (part B), then for part A, the correct option would have A as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Looking at the options, option A is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, earlier I thought that neither benzoquinone nor the trione can tautomerize. But according to this, part A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me reevaluate part A.

Which one doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone: Structure with two ketones. Does it have any -OH groups? No. So, can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Structure with three ketones. Does it have any -OH groups? No. So, also can't undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but that would mean both don't show tautomerism, which can't be right because the question says one of them doesn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one of them can. Let me think: Benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a conjugated system. Maybe it can tautomerize, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. Because it's a cyclic structure, maybe it can form an enol. But without an -OH group, I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the trione can't tautomerize, but benzoquinone can. That would make A = benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up which one can and can't. Let me think again.

If benzoquinone has two ketone groups and can't tautomerize, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might also not tautomerize. But the question implies that one of them does not.

Hmm. Maybe part A is incorrect in my analysis, but since part B is clear, I'll proceed.

So, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking at the options:

Option B has A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D has A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

But I thought B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the correct option would be B or A in the options.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

If part A is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, then the correct option is A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl.

So, option A: A is trione, B is methyl.

But earlier I thought that benzoquinone can't tautomerize either, so why would the trione not tautomerize?

I'm confused. Maybe I should conclude based on the part B analysis, which seems clearer.

So, the options are:

If part A is benzoquinone, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → option B.

If part A is trione, part B is methyl → option A.

But I'm not sure about part A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the stability of the compounds. Trione is more likely to be stable and less reactive, perhaps not undergoing tautomerism. Benzoquinone, being a conjugated di-ketone, might be more likely to tautomerize, but without an -OH, I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, each C=O is adjacent to a CH group. So, each C=O has adjacent H's. So, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize, but without an -OH group, how?

Wait, perhaps the structure allows for the formation of an enol without an -OH. But that's not possible because the enol form requires a hydrogen to shift from an -OH to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because it lacks an -OH, while the trione also can't. So, perhaps the correct answer is that neither can, but the question says one can't.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. But earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I concluded that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism because the central carbon is a chiral center. So, if part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the correct option is B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl.

But I'm not fully confident about part A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm not sure and proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (Part A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (Part B) among the given options.

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen atom adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift to form an enol or keto structure. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the para positions. While it has hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, it lacks an -OH group necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbonyl carbons are flanked by CH₂ groups, and there are no hydroxyl groups (-OH) adjacent to the carbonyls. Without an -OH group, tautomerism cannot occur, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also does not show tautomerism.

Both compounds lack the necessary -OH group for tautomerism, but the question implies that one does not show tautomerism. Based on the analysis, **benzoquinone** is the more likely candidate to be identified as the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or another form of chirality.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)H-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the -OH group) is attached to four different substituents: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (CH₃O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The central double bond has two identical groups (COOCH₃) on each side, making the molecule symmetrical. This symmetry results in a meso compound, which is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.

Based on the analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me read it again.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

I remember that tautomerism has to do with the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, a compound must have both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group adjacent to it, so that the hydrogen can shift.

Looking at part A first. Let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone oxygens. Wait, no, benzoquinone is more like a benzene ring with two double bonds, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups. Oh wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in a diketone structure. So it's O=C6H4=O or something similar. So it's a cyclic diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So it's a six-membered ring with three ketones opposite each other, like every other carbon has a carbonyl.

Now, tautomerism. Let me think. Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen can shift from an -OH group to a carbonyl group, converting between a keto and enol form. For that, the compound needs both an -OH and a carbonyl adjacent to each other. 

So benzoquinone: Each ketone is at positions 1 and 2 (if it's para) or 1 and 4 (ortho or meta?) Wait, no, benzoquinone is either para or ortho. Wait, I think benzoquinone is a para-diketone, so the two ketones are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4. So each is a C=O group. Are they adjacent? No, they're opposite. So each carbonyl is a C=O, but there are no hydroxyl groups. Wait, no, wait: benzoquinone is O=C-C6H2-C(=O)-O. No, wait, that's not right. Maybe it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, for example, 1,4-benzoquinone would have two ketones across from each other.

But in either case, Benzoquinone has two ketone groups but no hydroxyl groups. So, without an -OH adjacent to a carbonyl, can it undergo tautomerism? I don't think so. Because tautomerism requires the transfer of a hydrogen from an -OH to a carbonyl. If there's no -OH group, then no keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't have any -OH groups; it's all C=O. So it can't undergo tautomerism. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, maybe benzoquinone is an enol form. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let's think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane. Each is opposite each other. So, each C=O is on carbons 1,3,5. So each is adjacent to other carbonyls. Wait, so in this molecule, maybe there are -OH groups. Because, wait, can any of the carbonyls act as -OH?

Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are all ketones, so they can't lose a proton because they're ketones. Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a keto group and an enol group. The enol form has a double bond and an -OH. So, say, if a compound has a C=O and a C-OH next to it, it can tautomerize.

But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is adjacent to other ketones. Let me visualize the structure. The cyclohexane ring has three carbonyl groups alternating with CH2 groups. So at each of the 1,3,5 positions, there's a C=O, and the 2,4,6 positions are CH2. So, each C=O is between two CH2 groups. So, could any of the CH2 groups have an -OH? No, because the structure is all C=O and CH2.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the structure. If the molecule is 1,3,5-trione, then it's O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C- arranged in a ring? No, wait, each position is a carbon. So, in the ring, positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, and 2,4,6 are CH2. So each C=O is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, the CH2 groups are in between the carbonyls. So, any of those CH2 groups can't be an -OH, because they're CH2. So, in that case, there's no -OH group attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. So, can that compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, no. Because tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, if the molecule has a hydroxyl group next to a ketone, that's when tautomerism can occur. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the CH2 groups are between the ketones. So, each C=O is between two CH2 groups. So, the CH2 groups are not -OH. Therefore, there's no possibility for tautomerism because there's no -OH group adjacent to a carbonyl in either compound.

Wait, but wait. What about benzoquinone? Let me think again. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Are there any positions where a hydroxyl could form or is present? Or, perhaps, in benzoquinone, is there any possibility for enol tautomerism?

Wait, another thought. Quinones are known for their resonance structures. Benzoquinone can exist in different forms due to keto-enol tautomerism. If benzoquinone has a conjugated enol form, it might show tautomerism. Let me visualize it.

Benzoquinone: It's O=C6H4=O. So, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. But in some cases, quinones can have enol tautomers. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are opposite each other. The molecule can lose two protons and form a conjugated enol. So, the structure would have two double bonds and a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe. So, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the trione can't. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each carbonyl is in the ring, with CH2 groups in between. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- in a ring. So, each C=O is flanked by CH2 groups. So, the CH2 groups are not OH groups. So, there's no adjacent H to a carbonyl to allow for tautomerism. Therefore, this compound can't tautomerize.

But benzoquinone: If it has two ketones, but perhaps, in some positions, there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, no. In the benzene ring, each C=O is attached to a carbon which is connected to other carbons. So, the carbons adjacent to C=O are each connected to two other carbons in the ring, and perhaps have a hydrogen. Wait, if the structure is O=C6H4=O, then each C=O is attached to two CH groups.

So, each C=O is at positions 1 and 4. So, the adjacent carbons (2 and 6 for C1, and 3 and 5 for C4) are each CH groups. So, each has a hydrogen attached. So, maybe the H on carbon 2 is adjacent to the C=O at 1. So, could that H be involved in tautomerism? Because it's adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, tautomerism usually involves a hydrogen moving from an -OH group to a carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, that's keto-enol tautomerism. So, in a compound with a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group on an adjacent carbon, the H from the hydroxyl can move to the carbonyl carbon, converting the keto form to the enol form.

But in benzoquinone, there's no -OH group. So, that can't happen. So benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it lacks the hydroxyl group. Therefore, which of the two compounds can't tautomerize? Benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also doesn't? Or wait, maybe I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen and a carbonyl that can shift. So, for example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, perhaps one of the carbonyls is adjacent to a CH group, which can lose a hydrogen, leading to a shift. But wait, without an -OH, how would that happen?

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the trione can undergo some kind of tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are conjugated. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for examples. Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a symmetrical molecule with three carbonyl groups. I don't recall it undergoing tautomerism. On the other hand, benzoquinone can tautomerize perhaps because it's a conjugated system, but without an -OH. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe benzoquinone can't.

Wait, what's the structure of each?

Benzoquinone: It's benzene with two ketone groups. So, O=C-C6H4-C(=O)-O? No, wait, it's O=C6H4=O. So, it's a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups para to each other. So, each of those carbonyls is at C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C3, for example) are CH groups. So, each has a hydrogen attached. But without an -OH group, how would tautomerism occur?

Wait, perhaps in some cases, the H can be abstracted. Let me think: In the keto form, you have C=O groups. If a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon were to shift, would that form an enol? But that would require the adjacent carbon to have a hydrogen, which it does, but without a hydroxyl group, how would the hydrogen transfer happen?

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Tautomerism is the transfer of a hydrogen from an -OH group to a carbonyl. So, without an -OH, you can't have that process. Therefore, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione don't have -OH groups, so neither can undergo tautomerism. But wait, that can't be right because the question states that one of them does not show tautomerism. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe one of the compounds can tautomerize despite the lack of an -OH. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Maybe in some cases, the structure allows for the formation of enol without an -OH group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them has the appropriate substituents.

Wait, perhaps the trione can tautomerize. Let me think about another compound. For example, cyclohexanone. It can't tautomerize because it's a ketone, but if there's an -OH adjacent, like in some cyclic ketones, then it can. But in this case, the trione doesn't have any -OH groups, so it can't.

Hmm. So, maybe neither of them can, but the question says one of them doesn't. So perhaps the answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, but why? Because it's a trione, perhaps it's too stable. Alternatively, perhaps it's because it doesn't have the necessary -OH group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial part of the question. The first part is asking which compound doesn't show tautomerism. So, the options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, if both can't show tautomerism, then that's a problem. But the options suggest that one of them is the correct answer for A.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about benzoquinone. Let's think: Can benzoquinone tautomerize? I think I've heard that para-benzoquinone can exist in keto and enol forms. Wait, but without an -OH group, how? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of tautomerism. Wait, maybe it's a case of aromatic tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom from a position adjacent to a carbonyl group to another position, leading to the conversion between keto and enol forms. So, for that, the molecule must have a structure where a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl can move to the carbonyl carbon, forming a double bond.

In benzoquinone, each C=O is between two CH groups. So, each has H attached. So, perhaps the H on C2 can move to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), resulting in a ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. Wait, but without an -OH, how? Maybe the H is abstracted, leading to a ring with a double bond and a negative charge, which isn't stable. So, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because it doesn't have an -OH group.

Wait, perhaps the trione can. Let me think: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each C=O is between CH2 groups. So, perhaps one of the CH2 groups can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond. But that would require a transition state where the hydrogen is moving, but without an -OH, that's not possible. So, perhaps neither can tautomerize. But again, the question implies one does and the other doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about benzoquinone. If it's in a solution, perhaps it can undergo some kind of resonance or tautomerism. For example, maybe the carbonyl groups can rotate, but that's more about resonance than tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the two carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow for hydrogen transfer. Whereas the trione, with three carbonyls spaced around the ring, might have a position where a hydrogen can shift.

Wait, perhaps the trione can't tautomerize because all carbonyls are equivalent and symmetrically arranged, so there's no possible site for hydrogen transfer. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the trione can tautomerize, but benzoquinone can't. That would make A = benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So, which is it?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for similar structures. For example, cyclohexanone can't tautomerize because it's a simple ketone without an adjacent -OH. But if a compound has multiple ketones, perhaps it can't. So, maybe neither of them can, but the question implies one can't. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize. Let me think: Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. If a hydrogen from one of the adjacent CH groups can move to a carbonyl carbon, forming an enol structure. But without a hydroxyl group, where would the hydrogen go? Maybe it forms a conjugated dienol structure? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione can't because all the CH2 groups are between the carbonyls, and thus can't form an enol structure. So, both can't tautomerize, but that's not possible because the question states that one doesn't.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should move on to part B and come back.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, it can arise from other forms of chirality, like axial chirality, but that's less common.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write its structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, the structure is O

       O
       ||
CH3-O-C-O-C(H)(OH)-CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait. No, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Let me correct that.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But wait, in the ester, the -OH of the acid is replaced by OCH3. So, the structure should be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbon chain is:

CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, that's not right. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, look for chiral centers. The carbon with the OH is the second carbon (CH2(OH)). Let me see: The groups attached to that carbon are:

- CH2COOCH3 (the rest of the molecule)
- OH
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons. The carboxylic acid is at carbon 3. So, carbon 1: CH3O-CO-O-, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: CH(OH), carbon 4: CH2?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So, the ester would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the ester structure: the central carbon (the second carbon) has the groups:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. The second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to see it as:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let me clearly list the groups:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 (connected to carbon 1 and 3)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

So, the central CH2 is connected to:

- HO-CH2-
- CH2-CO-O-CH3.

Wait, so the CH2 in the middle (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: HO-CH2-
- Carbon 3: CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two CH2 groups (from either side? No, because it's a chain: H2C-CH2-CO-OCH3).

Wait, no, the molecule is: HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the second carbon (the CH2 in the middle) is connected to:

- HO-CH2-
- CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, the second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

Groups attached to the second carbon (CH2):

1. The CH2OH group (from carbon 1)
2. The CH2COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
3. Two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each carbon in a CH2 group has two H's. So, the second carbon is connected to:

- One CH2OH group (carbon 1)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (carbon 3)
- Two H atoms.

So, the four substituents are: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and H. Wait, but that means two H's. So, the substituents are not all different. Therefore, the second carbon is not a chiral center because it has two H's. So, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the third carbon is the chiral center. Let me see: The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon. So, the third carbon is CH2 connected to COOCH3. So, its substituents are:

- CH2OH
- CH2CH2 (from carbon 2)
- COOCH3
- H.

Wait, no. The third carbon is CH2 connected to COOCH3. So, the groups are:

- CH2OH (from carbon 2)
- CH3-O-CO (from the ester)
- Two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: HO-CH2-
2: CH2-
3: COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

- HO-CH2- (carbon 1)
- CH2- (carbon 3)
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center.

Hmm. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. So, does that mean it doesn't show optical isomerism? But wait, maybe there's another possibility. Wait, what about the ester group? The ester is OCH3, which is a substituent, but the carbonyl is a double bond. So, maybe the central CH2 isn't a chiral center.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with two double bonds. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. The dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no, because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, I think I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the structure is trans-butenedioic acid. So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2(COOCH3)2? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle.

Wait, more accurately, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, no, wait: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is a trans-dioic acid. So, the dimethyl ester is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the central part is CH=CH, with the two ester groups on either end.

Now, considering chirality. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of chirality like axial chirality. In this case, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side.

Let me look at the double bond in dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. The double bond is between the two CH groups. So, each CH is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3O groups? Wait, no.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on one side.
- Another COOCH3 group on the other side?

No, wait, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me better draw the structure.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on one side.
- Another COOCH3 group on the other side.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end.

Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen. So, each CH has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would have each -COOH converted to -COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is (CH2(COOCH3))CH=CH(CH2(COOCH3))? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. But that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, not fumarate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Fumarate has a structure with a double bond between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, but that can't be right because each carbon can't have four bonds. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- One COOCH3 group on each side.

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end, and two H's.

So, each CH has:

- CH2(COOCH3) on one side and CH2(COOCH3) on the other, but with a double bond in between.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond has two substituents on each carbon. The substituents on each CH are:

- COOCH3 on both sides.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

So, each CH has four substituents: two COOCH3, two H's. But that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, perhaps each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end, and two H's.

Wait, that's possible. So, each CH is attached to:

- One COOCH3 on the left and right, and two H's.

But in that case, the molecule would be symmetrical, so no chirality.

Wait, no, because the substituents are arranged in a certain way around the double bond. Let's think about the configuration around the double bond.

In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. But wait, that's not possible because that would require each carbon to have four bonds, which it does.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. So, that's not fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the possibility of optical isomerism in dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate has a structure with a double bond and two ester groups on either end. The arrangement around the double bond could lead to E/Z isomerism, but E and Z are about the arrangement around the double bond and don't directly cause optical isomerism. Unless the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but fumarate is trans; that is, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is trans, making the molecule symmetrical. So, in that case, does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making it a meso compound. So, the molecule is symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Fumarate is trans, and maleate is cis. So, in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical, and thus, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, it can't be chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, but that can't be right because dimethyl fumarate is used as an example of a compound with optical isomerism in some contexts. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me check the structure again.

Wait, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the carbons are:

Carbonyl-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
Carbonyl-OCH3

No, that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the two CH groups are connected by a double bond, and each has a COOCH3 group.

So, each CH is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group on each end.

Wait, that's not possible because each CH can only have four bonds. Let me think of each CH as having:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, but that's not possible because each CH can only have four bonds. So, each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group, one CH (double bond), and two H's.

Ah, that makes sense.

So, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- CH (double bond)
- Two H's.

So, each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH (double bond)
- H
- H.

Wait, no, that's not possible because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH (double bond)
- Two H's.

So, each CH has substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond to the other CH.

In this case, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3 (one substituent)
- H (two substituents)
- The double bond (which is between the two CH groups).

So, each CH has three substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. Wait, but that's four bonds, right? So, each CH is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- The double bond to the other CH.

So, each CH has four bonds, which works.

Now, the molecule is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the two CH groups are each attached to a COOCH3 and two H's, and connected by a double bond. The question is, is this molecule chiral?

For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or another form of chirality.

In this case, the molecule has a central double bond with two identical groups on each side. Each CH has a COOCH3 and two H's. So, the substituents on each CH are:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Double bond to the other CH.

So, each CH is symmetric because the substituents are the same on both sides. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because fumarate is a trans-dioic acid, and its ester would retain that structure. So, perhaps I'm missing something about the symmetry.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, then it's meso, and thus not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and two H's. So, each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Double bond to the other CH.

So, the substituents on each CH are the same: COOCH3, H, H. So, each CH is not a chiral center because it has two H's. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, and thus, doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, that means both methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate don't show optical isomerism, which can't be the case because the question implies one does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again.

The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, meaning it's not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing another possibility. What about the ester group? The ester is OCH3, but that's a single group attached to the carbonyl, not a chiral center.

Hmm. So, neither of them shows optical isomerism? That can't be right because the question states that one of them does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. Maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each CH are not the same.

Wait, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, each CH is attached to COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each CH has the same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism.

But that can't be right because I thought fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, which is cis. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate (trans) has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is meso and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is confusing. So, both compounds don't show optical isomerism? That can't be the case because the question implies one does.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, the ester is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but that would be a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- HO-CH2-
- CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. Therefore, not a chiral center.

Wait, but what about the third carbon? The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon. So, substituents on the third carbon:

- CH2-CH2OH
- COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, the third carbon is CH2, so it can't be a chiral center.

Hmm. So, maybe neither of the compounds shows optical isomerism, but the question states one does. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another possibility. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, which would create a chiral center. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to have optical isomerism. Wait, perhaps in the case of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the ester group is attached to a carbon that's a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the carbons are:

1: CH2OH
2: CH2
3: COOCH3.

So, carbon 2 is connected to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, not a chiral center.

Hmm. So, perhaps I'm stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate. Let me think differently. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. The central double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH has:

- Two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, but that would mean each CH has four substituents: two COOCH3, two H's. So, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 and two H's. So, the substituents are same on each side, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it's a meso compound and not chiral.

So, neither of the two compounds shows optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the question says one of them does.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, not a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the COOCH3 group is attached to a chiral center. Let me look at the third carbon. The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon, which is connected to:

- CH2CH2OH
- COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. The third carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from the ester and the CH2OH)
- Two H's.

No, that's not correct. The third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, which is a carbonyl, so it's double-bonded to O. So, the third carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded and thus can't be a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look up what I can remember. I think that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a meso compound. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism. Therefore, looking back at the options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

Wait, if part A is which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Let's think again.

If benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone. So, options B and D have A as benzoquinone.

If part B is which compound shows optical isomerism, but I thought neither did. But according to the options, the answer for B must be either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again: If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central CH2 is attached to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's. Not a chiral center.

But wait, what if the structure is different? Suppose the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester. Then, the carbon with the OH would have substituents:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H.

So, four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would show optical isomerism.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which is 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H.

So, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes sense. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Earlier, I thought it's a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism. So, in that case, the correct answer would be that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, going back to part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism. If the trione can't tautomerize, then A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about whether benzoquinone can tautomerize. But according to my latest thought, since methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (part B), then for part A, the correct option would have A as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Looking at the options, option A is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, earlier I thought that neither benzoquinone nor the trione can tautomerize. But according to this, part A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me reevaluate part A.

Which one doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone: Structure with two ketones. Does it have any -OH groups? No. So, can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Structure with three ketones. Does it have any -OH groups? No. So, also can't undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but that would mean both don't show tautomerism, which can't be right because the question says one of them doesn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one of them can. Let me think: Benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a conjugated system. Maybe it can tautomerize, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. Because it's a cyclic structure, maybe it can form an enol. But without an -OH group, I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the trione can't tautomerize, but benzoquinone can. That would make A = benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up which one can and can't. Let me think again.

If benzoquinone has two ketone groups and can't tautomerize, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might also not tautomerize. But the question implies that one of them does not.

Hmm. Maybe part A is incorrect in my analysis, but since part B is clear, I'll proceed.

So, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking at the options:

Option B has A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D has A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

But I thought B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the correct option would be B or A in the options.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

If part A is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, then the correct option is A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl.

So, option A: A is trione, B is methyl.

But earlier I thought that benzoquinone can't tautomerize either, so why would the trione not tautomerize?

I'm confused. Maybe I should conclude based on the part B analysis, which seems clearer.

So, the options are:

If part A is benzoquinone, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → option B.

If part A is trione, part B is methyl → option A.

But I'm not sure about part A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the stability of the compounds. Trione is more likely to be stable and less reactive, perhaps not undergoing tautomerism. Benzoquinone, being a conjugated di-ketone, might be more likely to tautomerize, but without an -OH, I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, each C=O is adjacent to a CH group. So, each C=O has adjacent H's. So, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize, but without an -OH group, how?

Wait, perhaps the structure allows for the formation of an enol without an -OH. But that's not possible because the enol form requires a hydrogen to shift from an -OH to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because it lacks an -OH, while the trione also can't. So, perhaps the correct answer is that neither can, but the question says one can't.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. But earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I concluded that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism because the central carbon is a chiral center. So, if part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the correct option is B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl.

But I'm not fully confident about part A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm not sure and proceed to the conclusion.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (Part A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (Part B) among the given options.

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen atom adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift to form an enol or keto structure. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the para positions. While it has hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, it lacks an -OH group necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbonyl carbons are flanked by CH₂ groups, and there are no hydroxyl groups (-OH) adjacent to the carbonyls. Without an -OH group, tautomerism cannot occur, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also does not show tautomerism.

Both compounds lack the necessary -OH group for tautomerism, but the question implies that one does not show tautomerism. Based on the analysis, **benzoquinone** is the more likely candidate to be identified as the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or another form of chirality.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)H-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the -OH group) is attached to four different substituents: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (CH₃O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The central double bond has two identical groups (COOCH₃) on each side, making the molecule symmetrical. This symmetry results in a meso compound, which is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.

Based on the analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.
