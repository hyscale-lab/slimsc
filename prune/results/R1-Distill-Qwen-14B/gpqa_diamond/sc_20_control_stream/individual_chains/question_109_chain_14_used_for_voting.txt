Okay, so I've got this nuclear physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what each part of the notation means. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: S is 0 because it's S=0, L is 0 (since it's S orbital), and J is 0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, no, wait. The formula given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. But wait, isn't isospin a different quantum number? Oh right, nucleons have isospin (protons and neutrons are isospin partners), but in a two-nucleon system, the isospin can combine in certain ways.

Wait, the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T_final is 0. Since T is the isospin of the NN system, which must be a singlet (I think isospin 0) or triplet (I=1), etc. But in this case, the final state is T=0, which is the singlet state.

Now, the initial state: the two nucleons are in a 1S0 state. So their spin S is 0, since it's S=0 (from 1S0). The orbital angular momentum L is 0 (S state). So what is the initial isospin T_initial? Hmm, wait, the initial state is the same as the final state in terms of the NN system because they're just emitting a particle. Wait, no, no. Oh wait, no, the initial state is the bound NN system, and the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. Wait, but the question is about the final NN state. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The initial NN is in a 1S0 state. The process is that they emit a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. But when considering the Pauli exclusion, perhaps we need to look at the combined state of the two nucleons (NN) and the emitted particle.

Wait, no, the problem statement says that Pauli statistics require that for the final NN state, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T, S, L are properties of the NN system in the final state.

So the NN system in the final state has T=0. So T=0, and we need to find out what S and L are, based on the condition T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

So T=0. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S and L must have opposite parities (one even, one odd). Because their sum is 1 mod 2.

So, S is the spin of the NN system, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state.

Wait, but the initial state was 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. But after emitting X, the NN system can end up in different states. The question is about the allowed partial waves for X.

Wait, but the process is the NN system emits X, so the X has some angular momentum state, which affects the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.

Wait, X is a particle emitted with angular momentum state denoted by the lowercase letter. For example, in option A, X has p (which is l=1), so the angular momentum state is p. Similarly, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.

Wait, no, wait. The term 'lowercase letter' refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So the options list the emitted particle's l. So for option A, X is in a 'p' state, which is l=1.

Now, the X particle carries away some angular momentum. So when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) and the angular momentum of X (l_X) must combine with the orbital angular momentum of the initial state (L_initial=0) to give the total angular momentum carried in the emission.

Wait, but the initial orbital angular momentum is zero (since it's 1S0). So the orbital angular momentum of X and the NN system after emission must add up in such a way that conservation of angular momentum is satisfied.

Wait, but more accurately, the total angular momentum is conserved. So the initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0 (since J=0 in 1S0). The final state has the NN system with angular momentum J_NN, and the X particle with angular momentum j_X. But in terms of angular momentum addition, the total J_final must equal J_initial, which is zero.

But perhaps another approach is better. The parity of the initial state and the final state must be the same because parity is conserved in strong interactions (though not always in weak, but this problem probably assumes conservation). The initial state has parity P_initial.

The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The final state is the NN system in some state with L_NN and the X particle with l_X. The parity of the final state would be the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X.

The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} because X's intrinsic parity is given as -1. Wait, wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. But intrinsic parity is the parity of the particle when it's at rest, so for a particle, its parity is (-1)^{l} times any other factors. So the parity of X in the emitted state is (-1)^{l_X} * (intrinsic parity).

Wait, no, the intrinsic parity is the parity when the particle is in the s-state (l=0). So the intrinsic parity is given as -1. So when X is in an orbital state l, its parity is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity. Wait, no, maybe the parity of the emitted particle X is (-1)^l * (-1), because the intrinsic parity is -1.

Wait, to clarify: the parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is given by (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity. So if the intrinsic parity is p_0, the parity is p_0 * (-1)^l.

So for X, p_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X.

So the parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}.

The total parity is the product of these two, since parity is multiplicative. So P_final = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].

But since parity is conserved, P_final must equal P_initial, which is +1.

So:

[ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ] = (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = +1.

So (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = 1.

Which implies L_NN + l_X + 1 must be even → L_NN + l_X must be odd.

So L_NN + l_X is odd.

Now, going back to the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

We know T(NN) = 0, so:

0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S and L_NN have opposite parity.

Wait, S is the total spin of the NN system. The spin can be 0, 1, etc. But in the initial state, the NN system was in 1S0, which is S=0. Wait, but after emitting X, does the spin change? Or is it the same?

Wait, the spin is part of the internal state. So the spin of the NN system in the final state could be different? Hmm, but the initial state is S=0. If the emission doesn't change the spin, then the final spin is S=0 as well? Or can it change?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: the spin of the NN system is determined by their relative motion. When they emit a particle, the spin might change, but perhaps in this problem, the spin remains the same. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin and orbital angular momentum are considered separately. So, the spin of the NN system could change if the emission affects it, but perhaps in this scenario, the spin doesn't change. Alternatively, the spin and orbital angular momentum are combined to give J, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin S of the NN system in the final state must be the same as the initial state because the emission doesn't change the spin. Wait, but maybe that's not necessarily true. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0. So the initial spin is 0. The NN system emits a particle; what determines the spin of the final NN system? Well, when two particles emit a third, the spin can change based on how the interaction happens, but I'm not entirely sure. However, in the problem, the condition given is about the final state's T, S, and L. So perhaps we need to find S and L for the final NN state.

Back to the Pauli condition: T= S + L +1 mod 2.

Given T=0, we have S + L = 1 mod 2 → S and L have opposite parities.

Now, considering that the initial state was S=0, L=0, J=0. So spin and orbital are zero. After emission, the spin might change, but perhaps the Pauli condition applies to the final state's S and L.

So, for each option, we'll have to determine the final state's S and L and see if they satisfy S + L =1 mod 2, and also check the parity condition (L_NN + l_X is odd).

Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to a certain state plus X in a particular orbital state.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse that term symbol. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1: 2S+1 =7 → S=3, since 2*3+1=7. L is D, which is L=2. And J=1.

Wait, but the final NN state's L is 2, S is 3. So S=3 (mod 2 is 1), L=2 (mod 2 is 0). So S + L = 1 +0 =1 mod 2. That satisfies the condition S + L =1 mod 2. So this is allowed.

Now, L_NN is 2, and the emitted X is in a p state, which is l=1. So L_NN=2, l_X=1. So L_NN + l_X =3 which is odd, so parity condition holds. So this option is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

The term is 3S1: 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S, which is 0. J=1.

So S=1, L=0. S + L =1 +0=1 mod2. So condition holds.

X is emitted in p state: l_X=1. L_NN=0. So L_NN + l_X=0+1=1 → odd. So parity condition holds. So this is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 → 3D3 + f.

3D3: 2S+1=3 → S=1. L=D → 2. J=3.

S=1, L=2. S + L = 1+2=3 → 1 mod2. Condition holds.

X is in f state → l=3.

L_NN=2, l_X=3 → sum is 5, which is odd. So parity holds. So allowed.

Option D: 1S0 → 3P0 + s.

3P0: 2S+1=3 → S=1. L=P →1. J=0.

So S=1, L=1. S + L =1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. So S + L =0 mod2, which doesn't satisfy the condition S + L =1 mod2. So this would violate the Pauli condition. Therefore, this partial wave is not permitted.

Wait, but wait: let me check. S=1, L=1. S + L =2 → mod2 is 0. Which isn't 1. So the condition isn't met. So this transition is not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2. So 0 ≠1 → condition not met. Therefore, this is not allowed.

Also, the parity condition: L_NN is 1, and X is emitted in s state (l=0). So L_NN + l_X =1+0=1 → odd. So parity condition holds.

But since the Pauli condition is violated, this option is not allowed.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the incorrect one is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions and conservation laws. The initial state is a bound NN system in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the Pauli condition requires \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Substituting \( T(NN) = 0 \), we find \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), meaning \( S \) and \( L \) must have opposite parities.

Additionally, parity conservation implies that the parity of the final state must equal the parity of the initial state. The initial parity is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{initial}}} = (-1)^0 = +1 \). The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN system, \( (-1)^{L_{NN}} \), and the parity of the emitted particle \( X \), which is \( (-1)^{l_X} \cdot (-1) \) (since \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\)). Thus, \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{NN} + l_X + 1} \), and conservation of parity requires \( L_{NN} + l_X + 1 \) to be even, or equivalently, \( L_{NN} + l_X \) to be odd.

We now analyze each option:

### Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
- The final NN state is \( 7D1 \), where \( 2S+1 = 7 \implies S = 3 \), \( L = 2 \), and \( J = 1 \).

- \( L_{NN} = 2 \), \( l_X = 1 \) (from \( p \)-state). \( L_{NN} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd, satisfying the parity condition.
- **This partial wave is allowed.**

### Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
- The final NN state is \( 3S1 \), where \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 1 \).
- \( S = 1 \) (odd), \( L = 0 \) (even). \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the Pauli condition.
- \( L_{NN} = 0 \), \( l_X = 1 \) (from \( p \)-state). \( L_{NN} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd, satisfying the parity condition.
- **This partial wave is allowed.**

### Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
- The final NN state is \( 3D3 \), where \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \), \( L = 2 \), and \( J = 3 \).
- \( S = 1 \) (odd), \( L = 2 \) (even). \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the Pauli condition.
- \( L_{NN} = 2 \), \( l_X = 3 \) (from \( f \)-state). \( L_{NN} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd, satisfying the parity condition.
- **This partial wave is allowed.**

### Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
- The final NN state is \( 3P0 \), where \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \), \( L = 1 \), and \( J = 0 \).
- \( S = 1 \) (odd), \( L = 1 \) (odd). \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), violating the Pauli condition.
- \( L_{NN} = 1 \), \( l_X = 0 \) (from \( s \)-state). \( L_{NN} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd, satisfying the parity condition.
- **This partial wave is not allowed.**
