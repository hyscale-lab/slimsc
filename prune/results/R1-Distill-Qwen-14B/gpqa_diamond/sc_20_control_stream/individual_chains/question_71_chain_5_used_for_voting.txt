Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

So the setup is that there are five exoplanets, named Planet_1 to Planet_5. They're in orbital resonance and have circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, but I don't think that's super relevant here. The key point is their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so each planet's period is a multiple of the first one. Let me write that down.

Planet_1: 1 unit
Planet_2: 2 units
Planet_3: 2.5 units
Planet_4: 3.5 units
Planet_5: 5 units

But wait, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So I need to find the ratio T4/T2.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. Since they have the same albedo, that factor (which affects how much light they reflect) cancels out. So the main factors are the distance and the star's luminosity.

The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/sigma )^0.25, but wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (distance from star). Also, the star's luminosity and the planet's albedo come into play.

Wait, the formula I recall is: Te = T_e (star) * sqrt(R/(2a)), but wait, another way: the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L / (16πσ a² ) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the planet's orbital radius.

But since all planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ will be the same for all. Albedo is the same as per the question, so (1 - A) is same. So the equilibrium temperature depends on a as Te ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4) = (1/a²)^(1/4) ) * L^(1/4). So, Te is proportional to 1/(a^(0.5)).

Wait, because (1/a²)^(1/4) is 1/(a^(2*(1/4))) = 1/(a^0.5). So yes, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So the further out the planet is, the lower its equilibrium temperature.

But the problem is, I don't have the actual distances, only the orbital periods. So I need to relate the periods to the distances. Oh, right, from Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So (P^2) = (4π²/GM) * a^3. So a^3 ∝ P^2.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = (P4)^(2/3), and a2 = (P2)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, no, more precisely, since a^3 = (P^2) * (GM/(4π²)), so a = ( (G M/(4π²))^(1/3) ) * P^(2/3). So the constant factor is same for all planets, so the ratio a4/a2 is just (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So now, the equilibrium temperatures are inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = [1/sqrt(a4)] / [1/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) = sqrt( ( (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) ) ) )

Wait, because a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3), and a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3), so the ratio a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So, T4/T2 = [ (a2/a4) ]^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me double-check that math.

We have a4 = k * P4^(2/3), a2 = k * P2^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So sqrt(a2/a4) is equal to (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, because Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 = T0 / sqrt(a4), T2 = T0 / sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) ) = sqrt( ( (k P2^(2/3) ) ) / (k P4^(2/3} ) ) ) ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct.

So, what's P4 and P2? P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 is 2/3.5. Let me compute that.

2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2/(7/2) )= 2*(2/7) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (P2/P4)^(1/3) is (4/7)^(1/3).

What's 4/7? About 0.5714. The cube root of that.

I need to calculate cube root of 0.5714.

Well, cube of 0.8 is 0.512. Cube of 0.83 is 0.83^3 = approx 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 ≈ ~0.5717. Oh wait, that's really close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, 0.83^3 is about 0.5717, which is very close to 0.5714. So the cube root is approximately 0.83.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the ratio is T4 to T2, which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. So T4 is cooler than T2? Because the planet is further out, yes. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if P4 is 3.5, which is longer period, so a4 is larger, so T4 is smaller.

So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So (a4/a2) = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

1.75 is 7/4, which is 1.75.

(1.75)^(2/3) = ( (1.75)^(1/3) )^2.

Cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2, because 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75, so maybe around 1.2.

So (1.2)^2 ≈ 1.44. So a4 is about 1.44 times a2.

Then, T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 is 1/sqrt(a2).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = 1/(sqrt(a4/a2)) = 1/(sqrt(1.44)) )= 1/1.2 ≈ 0.8333.

So yeah, that's the same result as before. So that's option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Using Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( a \) is proportional to the planet's orbital period raised to the power of \( \frac{2}{3} \), i.e., \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of distances \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \) is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, the orbital periods are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \), as \( 0.83^3 \approx 0.5717 \), which is very close to \( 0.5714 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} \approx 0.83
\]

This corresponds to option C.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = (P4)^(2/3), and a2 = (P2)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So now, the equilibrium temperatures are inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = [1/sqrt(a4)] / [1/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) = sqrt( ( (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) ) ) )

Wait, because a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3), and a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3), so the ratio a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So, T4/T2 = [ (a2/a4) ]^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me double-check that math.

We have a4 = k * P4^(2/3), a2 = k * P2^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, because Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 = T0 / sqrt(a4), T2 = T0 / sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) ) = sqrt( ( (k P2^(2/3) ) ) / (k P4^(2/3} ) ) ) ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct.

So, what's P4 and P2? P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 is 2/3.5. Let me compute that.

2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2/(7/2) )= 2*(2/7) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (P2/P4)^(1/3) is (4/7)^(1/3).

What's 4/7? About 0.5714. The cube root of that.

I need to calculate cube root of 0.5714.

Well, cube of 0.8 is 0.512. Cube of 0.83 is 0.83^3 = approx 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 ≈ ~0.5717. Oh wait, that's really close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, 0.83^3 is about 0.5717, which is very close to 0.5714. So the cube root is approximately 0.83.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the ratio is T4 to T2, which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. So T4 is cooler than T2? Because the planet is further out, yes. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if P4 is 3.5, which is longer period, so a4 is larger, so T4 is smaller.

So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So (a4/a2) = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

1.75 is 7/4, which is 1.75.

(1.75)^(2/3) = ( (1.75)^(1/3) )^2.

Cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2, because 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75, so maybe around 1.2.

So (1.2)^2 ≈ 1.44. So a4 is about 1.44 times a2.

Then, T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 is 1/sqrt(a2).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = 1/(sqrt(a4/a2)) = 1/(sqrt(1.44)) )= 1/1.2 ≈ 0.8333.

So yeah, that's the same result as before. So that's option C.
