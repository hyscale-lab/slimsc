Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again carefully. It's about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz, I think. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin precesses around the new field direction. But wait, since the field is turned off and then on again in a different direction, how does that affect the spin state?

Wait, the initial state is with the magnetic field along +Z. Since the spin is aligned with the field, the spin state is either up or down along Z. Let's say it's in the eigenstate of S_z. Now, when the field is switched to Y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z. Wait, but when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, right? Because the energy is -μ·B, so the Hamiltonian H would be proportional to S_y.

Wait, let me think more clearly. The magnetic moment is μ = γ S, I think. Oh, wait, the question says mu equals gamma times S_z. So μ = γ S_z. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because typically, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component in the direction of the magnetic field. But here, mu is given as gamma times S_z, regardless of the magnetic field direction. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial setup: the magnetic field is along +Z, and mu is aligned with it. So the magnetic moment is along Z. Then the field is turned off and turned on along Y. So the magnetic moment is now along Y? Or does the mu vector change direction? Or is mu fixed as proportional to S_z because the given mu is γ S_z?

Wait, the problem states mu = γ S_z. That implies that the magnetic moment is along the z-axis regardless of the direction of the magnetic field. Hmm, but that's not the usual case. Normally, the magnetic moment would align with the field, but here mu is fixed along z. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Maybe mu is the component along the field direction. The problem says mu is along the field, which is initially along Z.

Wait, no. The question says, "magnetic moment mu (= γ S_z)". So mu is the z-component of the spin multiplied by gamma. So the magnetic moment is along the z-axis. Hmm, but if the magnetic field is then pointing in the y-direction, how does that affect things?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field. The energy is given by E = -μ·B. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to μ·B.

In the initial state, mu is along Z, and B is along Z. So H is proportional to S_z. After the field is switched to Y, H becomes proportional to S_z multiplied by B in the Y direction? Wait, no. Because B is in Y, so the dot product μ·B would be mu (which is in Z) dotted with B (in Y), which is zero. That can't be right. Wait, that would imply the energy is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood mu. Maybe mu is the vector, not just its z-component. So mu = γ S, the vector, so mu_x = γ S_x, mu_y = γ S_y, mu_z = γ S_z. Then, when the magnetic field is along Z, the interaction is mu·B = γ B S_z. But when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu·B = γ B S_y. Oh, that makes sense.

So the initial setup is when the field is along Z. The spin state is along Z (eigenstate of S_z). Then, the field is turned off (so B is zero for a moment, but the spin state remains the same), and then turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Because E = -μ·B, and μ is γ S, so E = -γ B S · direction. Since B is along Y, E = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic field is along Y, so B = (0, B, 0). So μ·B = γ (S_x * 0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0) = γ B S_y. So the energy is E = -μ·B = -γ B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y.

So the time evolution of the spin state is determined by this Hamiltonian. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y.

To find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = γ <S_z>. So we need to find the time dependence of <S_z> and hence <mu_z>.

We can model this using time-dependent quantum mechanics. The initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z>. The Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Let me compute the time evolution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to switch to the rotating frame or diagonalize H.

Wait, S_y has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>. So when the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the state will precess in the y-z plane.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work in terms of the energy eigenbasis. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ and E_-.

The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

We can write |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because the states |+y> and |-y> are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So their sum is sqrt(2) |+z>, so |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So when time evolves, each component will pick up a phase factor. The time-dependent state is |psi(t)> = (e^{-i E_+/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_-/ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Compute E_+ and E_-: The eigenvalues of S_y are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So H = -γ B S_y, so E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2), and E_- = γ B (ħ/2).

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energies will be E = -γ B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = - (γ B ħ ) / 2, and E_- = (γ B ħ) / 2.

So the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i (-γ B ħ/2)/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i (γ B ħ/2)/ħ} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify the exponents:

The exponent for E_+ is (-i E_+ ) / ħ = (-i) * (-γ B ħ/2) / ħ = i (γ B / 2) * (ħ) / ħ ) → i (γ B / 2) * 1 → i (γ B t / 2 )

Wait, no, the exponent is (-i E t) / ħ.

Wait, E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2), so (-i E_+ t) / ħ = (-i) (- γ B ħ/2) t) / ħ = i (γ B t/2) * (ħ) / ħ. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute step by step.

E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2). So, E_+ t / ħ = (- γ B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ = (- γ B t) / 2.

Multiply by (-i): (-i) * (- γ B t / 2 ) = i γ B t / 2.

Similarly, E_- is γ B ħ/2. So E_- t / ħ = (γ B ħ/2) t / ħ = γ B t / 2.

Multiply by (-i): (-i) (γ B t/2 ) = -i γ B t/2.

So the state is:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i γ B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i γ B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, express this in terms of |+z> and |-z>. Remember that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

Substituting into |psi(t)>:

= [ e^{i γ B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i γ B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (e^{i γ B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i γ B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> )) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))

Which is [ ... ] / 2.

Expanding the terms inside:

= [e^{i θ} |+z> + e^{i θ} |-z> + e^{-i θ} |+z> - e^{-i θ} |-z> ] / 2, where θ = γ B t/2.

Combine like terms:

= [ (e^{i θ} + e^{-i θ}) |+z> + (e^{i θ} - e^{-i θ}) |-z> ] / 2.

Now, using Euler's formula:

e^{i θ} + e^{-i θ} = 2 cos θ
e^{i θ} - e^{-i θ} = 2i sin θ

So substituting:

= [ 2 cos θ |+z> + 2i sin θ |-z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z>

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = cos(γ B t/2) |+z> + i sin(γ B t/2) |-z>

Now, compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>
S_z |-z> = (- ħ/2)|-z>

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos^* (θ) ( ħ/2 ) cos(θ) ) + i cos^* (θ) (- ħ/2 ) i sin(θ) ) + (i sin^* (θ) ) ( ħ/2 ) (-i) cos(θ) ) + (i sin^* (θ) ) ( ħ/2 ) (i) sin(theta) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, write |psi(t)> as:

|psi(t)> = cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z>

So, <S_z> = [ cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z> ]† S_z [ cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z> ]

The dagger (†) gives the conjugate transpose.

So,

= [ cos^* θ < +z| + i sin^* θ < -z| ] S_z [ cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z> ]

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

= cos^* θ cos theta ( ħ/2 ) < +z | +z> 
+ cos^* theta (i sin theta) ( ħ/2 ) < +z | -z>
+ (i sin^* theta) cos theta ( - ħ/2 ) < -z | +z>
+ (i sin^* theta) (i sin theta) ( - ħ/2 ) < -z| -z>

But < +z | -z> is zero, as are the other cross terms. The diagonal terms:

= cos^* theta cos theta ( ħ/2 ) * 1 
+ (i sin^* theta)(i sin theta) ( - ħ/2 ) *1 

Note that cos^* theta is cos theta (since cos is real), and sin^* theta is sin theta.

So,

= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + ( (i^2) sin^2 theta ) ( - ħ/2 )

i squared is -1, so:

= ( (1/2) cos^2 theta ) ħ + ( (-1) sin^2 theta ) (- ħ/2 )

Simplify:

= ( ħ/2 ) cos^2 theta + ( (1) sin² theta ) ( ħ/2 )

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2)( cos² theta + sin² theta ) )

But cos² + sin² =1, so:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2.

Wait, that's a constant. But the question states that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. Hmm, that's a problem. Because according to this, <S_z> is ħ/2, which doesn't change with time.

Wait, no. Because mu_z is gamma times S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) * (something? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let's re-examine.

Wait, in the state |psi(t)>, the expectation value <S_z> is (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ].

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let's recompute <S_z>.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

The state is |+z> with amplitude cos(theta), and |-z> with amplitude i sin(theta). So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |cos(theta)|^2 * (ħ/2) + |i sin(theta)|^2 * (-ħ/2).

Because |i sin(theta)|^2 is (|i|^2)(|sin(theta)|^2) = 1 * sin^2(theta).

So,

= (cos^2(theta))(ħ/2) + (sin^2(theta)) (-ħ/2) )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Ah, okay, that's different. Because cos^2 - sin^2 is cos(2 theta). So <S_z> oscillates with frequency related to theta.

Theta is (gamma B t/2). So 2 theta is gamma B t.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Then, the magnetic moment's z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but mu is given as gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the average of mu_z is gamma times ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, so the angular frequency divided by 2 pi. But in the options, the frequencies are given without considering 2 pi. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) gamma B /2

B) gamma B

C) sqrt(2) gamma B

D) gamma B / sqrt(2)

So according to our calculation, <mu_z> oscillates with angular frequency gamma B, so the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, wait another thing. Because I thought mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B when the result is cos( gamma B t ). But let's double-check the step where I found <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), where theta is gamma B t /2.

Wait, theta is gamma B t/2. So 2 theta = gamma B t. So <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Then, <mu_z> is gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but mu = gamma S_z, so the units would suggest that gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}), perhaps? Because S_z has units of ħ/2 (since spin is ħ/2 for spin 1/2), but mu is magnetic moment, which for a spin is proportional to gamma times spin. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but in the calculation of <S_z>, I used the state |psi(t)> and found that <S_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t ). So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency of the oscillation is gamma B.

So the answer is option B) gamma B.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me think again. Let me think about the general approach. When a spin is placed in a magnetic field, the energy levels are quantized, and the transition frequency between the states is given by the energy difference divided by ħ.

In this problem, the initial state is |+z>, and the final Hamiltonian leads to energy eigenstates |+y> and |-y>. The energy difference between them is E_+ - E_- = (- gamma B (ħ/2 )) - (gamma B (ħ/2 )) ) = -gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is - gamma B ħ, but the frequency is given by (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (- gamma B ħ ) / ħ ) = - gamma B.

The time evolution involves oscillations at this frequency. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the average of the z-component of the moment oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on again along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin state to evolve over time, leading to oscillations in $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

2. **Time Evolution of the State**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, as follows:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, each eigenstate $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ evolves with a phase factor determined by their respective energies. The energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$. The time-evolved state is:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{i \gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i \gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the spin operator, $S_z$, is expressed in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$. Substituting the time-evolved state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, it is found that:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   The magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, so the expectation value of $\mu_z$ is:  
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since the question asks for the oscillation frequency (angular frequency), the answer is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options

- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.  
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillation is $\gamma B$.  
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.  
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer

The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. 

**Answer: B**

Because B is in Y, so the dot product μ·B would be mu (which is in Z) dotted with B (in Y), which is zero. That can't be right. Wait, that would imply the energy is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood mu. Maybe mu is the vector, not just its z-component. So mu = γ S, the vector, so mu_x = γ S_x, mu_y = γ S_y, mu_z = γ S_z. Then, when the magnetic field is along Z, the interaction is mu·B = γ B S_z. But when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu·B = γ B S_y. Oh, that makes sense.

So the initial setup is when the field is along Z. The spin state is along Z (eigenstate of S_z). Then, the field is turned off (so B is zero for a moment, but the spin state remains the same), and then turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Because E = -μ·B, and μ is γ S, so E = -γ B S · direction. Since B is along Y, E = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic field is along Y, so B = (0, B, 0). So μ·B = γ (S_x * 0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0) = γ B S_y. So the energy is E = -μ·B = -γ B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y.

So the time evolution of the spin state is determined by this Hamiltonian. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y.

To find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = γ <S_z>. So we need to find the time dependence of <S_z> and hence <mu_z>.

We can model this using time-dependent quantum mechanics. The initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z>. The Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Let me compute the time evolution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to switch to the rotating frame or diagonalize H.

Wait, S_y has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>. So when the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the state will precess in the y-z plane.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work in terms of the energy eigenbasis. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ and E_-.

The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

We can write |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because the states |+y> and |-y> are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So their sum is sqrt(2) |+z>, so |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So when time evolves, each component will pick up a phase factor. The time-dependent state is |psi(t)> = (e^{-i E_+/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_-/ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Compute E_+ and E_-: The eigenvalues of S_y are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So H = -γ B S_y, so E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2), and E_- = γ B (ħ/2).

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energies will be E = -γ B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = - (γ B ħ ) / 2, and E_- = (γ B ħ) / 2.

So the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i (-γ B ħ/2)/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i (γ B ħ/2)/ħ} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify the exponents:

The exponent for E_+ is (-i E_+ ) / ħ = (-i) * (-γ B ħ/2) / ħ = i (γ B / 2) * (ħ) / ħ ) → i (γ B / 2) * 1 → i (γ B t / 2 )

Wait, no, the exponent is (-i E t) / ħ.

Wait, E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2), so (-i E_+ t) / ħ = (-i) (- γ B ħ/2) t) / ħ = i (γ B t/2) * (ħ) / ħ. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute step by step.

E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2). So, E_+ t / ħ = (- γ B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ = (- γ B t) / 2.

Multiply by (-i): (-i) * (- γ B t / 2 ) = i γ B t / 2.

Similarly, E_- is γ B ħ/2. So E_- t / ħ = (γ B ħ/2) t / ħ = γ B t / 2.

Multiply by (-i): (-i) (γ B t/2 ) = -i γ B t/2.

So the state is:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i γ B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i γ B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, express this in terms of |+z> and |-z>. Remember that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

Substituting into |psi(t)>:

= [ e^{i γ B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i γ B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (e^{i γ B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i γ B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> )) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))

Which is [ ... ] / 2.

Expanding the terms inside:

= [e^{i θ} |+z> + e^{i θ} |-z> + e^{-i θ} |+z> - e^{-i θ} |-z> ] / 2, where θ = γ B t/2.

Combine like terms:

= [ (e^{i θ} + e^{-i θ}) |+z> + (e^{i θ} - e^{-i θ}) |-z> ] / 2.

Now, using Euler's formula:

e^{i θ} + e^{-i θ} = 2 cos θ
e^{i θ} - e^{-i θ} = 2i sin θ

So substituting:

= [ 2 cos θ |+z> + 2i sin θ |-z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z>

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = cos(γ B t/2) |+z> + i sin(γ B t/2) |-z>

Now, compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>
S_z |-z> = (- ħ/2)|-z>

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos^* (θ) ( ħ/2 ) cos(θ) ) + i cos^* (θ) (- ħ/2 ) i sin(θ) ) + (i sin^* (θ) ) ( ħ/2 ) (-i) cos(θ) ) + (i sin^* (θ) ) ( ħ/2 ) (i) sin(theta) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, write |psi(t)> as:

|psi(t)> = cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z>

So, <S_z> = [ cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z> ]† S_z [ cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z> ]

The dagger (†) gives the conjugate transpose.

So,

= [ cos^* θ < +z| + i sin^* θ < -z| ] S_z [ cos θ |+z> + i sin θ |-z> ]

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

= cos^* θ cos theta ( ħ/2 ) < +z | +z> 
+ cos^* theta (i sin theta) ( ħ/2 ) < +z | -z>
+ (i sin^* theta) cos theta ( - ħ/2 ) < -z | +z>
+ (i sin^* theta) (i sin theta) ( - ħ/2 ) < -z| -z>

But < +z | -z> is zero, as are the other cross terms. The diagonal terms:

= cos^* theta cos theta ( ħ/2 ) * 1 
+ (i sin^* theta)(i sin theta) ( - ħ/2 ) *1 

Note that cos^* theta is cos theta (since cos is real), and sin^* theta is sin theta.

So,

= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + ( (i^2) sin^2 theta ) ( - ħ/2 )

i squared is -1, so:

= ( (1/2) cos^2 theta ) ħ + ( (-1) sin^2 theta ) (- ħ/2 )

Simplify:

= ( ħ/2 ) cos^2 theta + ( (1) sin² theta ) ( ħ/2 )

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2)( cos² theta + sin² theta ) )

But cos² + sin² =1, so:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2.

Wait, that's a constant. But the question states that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. Hmm, that's a problem. Because according to this, <S_z> is ħ/2, which doesn't change with time.

Wait, no. Because mu_z is gamma times S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) * (something? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let's re-examine.

Wait, in the state |psi(t)>, the expectation value <S_z> is (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ].

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let's recompute <S_z>.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

The state is |+z> with amplitude cos(theta), and |-z> with amplitude i sin(theta). So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |cos(theta)|^2 * (ħ/2) + |i sin(theta)|^2 * (-ħ/2).

Because |i sin(theta)|^2 is (|i|^2)(|sin(theta)|^2) = 1 * sin^2(theta).

So,

= (cos^2(theta))(ħ/2) + (sin^2(theta)) (-ħ/2) )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Ah, okay, that's different. Because cos^2 - sin^2 is cos(2 theta). So <S_z> oscillates with frequency related to theta.

Theta is (gamma B t/2). So 2 theta is gamma B t.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Then, the magnetic moment's z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but mu is given as gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the average of mu_z is gamma times ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, so the angular frequency divided by 2 pi. But in the options, the frequencies are given without considering 2 pi. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) gamma B /2

B) gamma B

C) sqrt(2) gamma B

D) gamma B / sqrt(2)

So according to our calculation, <mu_z> oscillates with angular frequency gamma B, so the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, wait another thing. Because I thought mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B when the result is cos( gamma B t ). But let's double-check the step where I found <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), where theta is gamma B t /2.

Wait, theta is gamma B t/2. So 2 theta = gamma B t. So <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Then, <mu_z> is gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but mu = gamma S_z, so the units would suggest that gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}), perhaps? Because S_z has units of ħ/2 (since spin is ħ/2 for spin 1/2), but mu is magnetic moment, which for a spin is proportional to gamma times spin. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but in the calculation of <S_z>, I used the state |psi(t)> and found that <S_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t ). So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency of the oscillation is gamma B.

So the answer is option B) gamma B.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me think again. Let me think about the general approach. When a spin is placed in a magnetic field, the energy levels are quantized, and the transition frequency between the states is given by the energy difference divided by ħ.

In this problem, the initial state is |+z>, and the final Hamiltonian leads to energy eigenstates |+y> and |-y>. The energy difference between them is E_+ - E_- = (- gamma B (ħ/2 )) - (gamma B (ħ/2 )) ) = -gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is - gamma B ħ, but the frequency is given by (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (- gamma B ħ ) / ħ ) = - gamma B.

The time evolution involves oscillations at this frequency. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the average of the z-component of the moment oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on again along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin state to evolve over time, leading to oscillations in $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

2. **Time Evolution of the State**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, as follows:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, each eigenstate $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ evolves with a phase factor determined by their respective energies. The energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$. The time-evolved state is:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{i \gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i \gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the spin operator, $S_z$, is expressed in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$. Substituting the time-evolved state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, it is found that:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   The magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, so the expectation value of $\mu_z$ is:  
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since the question asks for the oscillation frequency (angular frequency), the answer is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options

- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.  
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillation is $\gamma B$.  
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.  
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer

The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. 

**Answer: B**
