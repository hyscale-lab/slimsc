Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R and a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is not at the center of the conductor; it's separated by a distance s from the center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially with cavities, we can use the concept of electrostatic shielding. Wait, but wait, the conductor is uncharged in this case. Oh right, the conductor itself is neutral, but it has a cavity with a charge inside.

So when a conductor is neutral but has a charge inside its cavity, what happens? The induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces will come into play. The inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the one inside the cavity. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface will have no net charge, right? So the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface has 0 charge because the overall charge is zero.

Wait, but the conductor is uncharged, so the net charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor (both inner and outer surfaces) must sum to zero. So the inner surface has -q (because the charge inside the cavity is +q), and the outer surface has +q. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of inner and outer surface charges must be zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor must have a charge that cancels the field inside the conductor. So by Gauss's law, the inner surface must have -q. Then, the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. Because sum of inner (-q) and outer (+q) is zero.

Wait, no. The conductor itself is neutral. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have a charge that's -q, and the outer surface must have +q? Because the sum is -q + q = 0. Wait, but the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must be zero? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor (both inner and outer surfaces) is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface's charge must be -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner's -q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the inner and outer surfaces add up to zero.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface must have -q by induction. Then the outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero: (-q) + (outer charge) = 0 → outer charge is +q.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the outer surface's charge would affect the electric field outside. Wait, but the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface's charge is zero. Hmm, maybe I'm messing up.

Wait, no, I think I'm wrong. Let's reevaluate. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface must have -q. The conductor's own charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner's -q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero: inner (-q) + outer (+q) = 0. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but that would mean the conductor as a whole has a charge of +q, which contradicts it being neutral. Wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer. So if the inner is -q, outer must be +q, making the total zero. Oh, right, that makes sense. So the conductor is neutral, so the sum is zero. So yes, the inner surface is -q, and outer is +q.

But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have no net charge. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of it this way. The conductor's material is neutral, so the sum of any induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. Because the conductor itself doesn't have any net charge.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the only charges present are from the cavity's charge and the induced charges. So the cavity has +q; the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Now, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of +q because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, that can't be right because then the conductor's net charge would be zero only if the outer surface has +q. Because inner is -q, outer is +q: sum is zero. So the conductor's net charge is zero. So yes, the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? Because the outer surface has +q, the electric field outside would be like that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So, E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but let me make sure. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So at point P, which is outside, E is the same as the field due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Hmm, but the way the problem is set up, the point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's outer surface's charge is the only thing affecting the field at P.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is at radius R, and point P is at L > R. So the field at P is just due to the +q on the outer surface. So E is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). Which would correspond to option B.

Wait, but let me reread the options. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L^2). So that's exactly what I'm thinking.

But wait, why can't the charge inside the cavity influence the field outside? Because the conductor's inner surface cancels the charge inside, so outside the conductor, the only charge is the +q on the outer surface. So yes, the field at P is only due to that +q.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about how the charge distribution affects the field. The inner cavity has +q, but the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface +q. The electric field inside the conductor material is zero. The field outside is like a point charge +q at the center.

So, in that case, the field at point P would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q)/(L²), which is option B.

Wait, but another thought: the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the distance between the centers is s. So l and s are vectors. The angle between l and s is theta. Does that affect the calculation? Because the charge in the cavity is inside the conductor, which is neutral, so the field outside shouldn't depend on where the cavity is located, right? Because the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, assuming the conductor is a perfect sphere.

Wait, but the conductor in this problem isn't a sphere because the cavity is off-center. Oh wait, the conductor is a spherical conductor, but the cavity is a spherical cavity not at the center. So the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is a smaller sphere inside, not at the center. So the conductor's inner surface isn't symmetric. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait no, the conductor is a spherical conductor, which is a shell, but the cavity is a small sphere inside. Oh wait, the conductor is a solid sphere, but I think the problem says it's a spherical conductor, which is a shell. Wait, the problem says 'spherical conductor of radius R' with a cavity inside. So, the conductor is a shell, right?

Wait, no. The wording is: "an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R having a small spherical cavity inside." So the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity inside. Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conducting shell with a cavity.

Wait, I think the setup is that the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity within it. So the conductor has a radius R, and within it, there's a small cavity of radius r, whose center is a distance s away from the conductor's center.

But in that case, how does the charge distribution work? Because the conductor is a solid sphere, the presence of the charge inside the cavity would cause charges to redistribute on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, but for a solid conductor, the charges can move freely. So, when a charge is placed inside the cavity (which is within the conductor), the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge. But wait, the conductor is a solid sphere, so the cavity is within the conductor material. That can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps the conductor is a shell, meaning that the cavity is inside the conductor's hollow part.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again. The conductor is a sphere of radius R, with a cavity (a smaller sphere) inside it, whose center is at a distance s from the conductor's center.

So the conductor is a solid sphere, but that's impossible because a solid sphere can't have a cavity inside without being a shell. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the conductor is a conducting shell, a hollow sphere, so the cavity is the hollow part, and the conductor is the shell.

Wait, the problem says, "a spherical conductor of radius R having a small spherical cavity inside." So the cavity is within the conductor. That would mean the conductor is a solid sphere, but that's not possible because a solid conductor can't have a cavity unless it's a shell. So I'm getting a bit confused about the setup.

Wait, perhaps the conductor is a conducting shell, so the cavity is the hollow part, and the conductor is the shell. So the conductor is a shell with inner radius R_inner and outer radius R_outer, but the problem says radius R. Hmm, but the problem says radius R. So perhaps the conductor is a solid sphere, but it's more likely that it's a conducting shell with a cavity, making the conductor's inner surface R and outer surface R + thickness, but the problem says radius R, so maybe it's a conducting shell with inner radius R and outer radius R plus some negligible thickness.

Wait, perhaps the conductor is a conducting shell with inner radius R and outer radius R (so a thin shell), but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to proceed.

If the conductor is a conducting shell, then the charge inside the cavity will induce a charge on the inner surface, and the outer surface will have a charge to make the conductor neutral. But in the problem, the conductor is uncharged, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Wait, but then the conductor's net charge is zero because (-q) + (+q) = 0.

But then, the electric field outside the conductor (which is at radius R_outer) would be as if the charge +q were at the center, because the outer surface has +q. So the electric field at point P outside the conductor (L > R_outer) would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). Which is option B.

But why does the position of the cavity matter then? Because the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the distance between the centers is s, with an angle theta. Well, if the conductor is a shell, the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So regardless of where the cavity is inside (as long as it's within the conductor), the field outside would be the same. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but what if the conductor is a solid sphere, not a shell? Let's think: If the conductor is a solid sphere (like a metal ball) with a cavity inside it, and a charge is placed in the cavity, then the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge -q. The rest of the conductor's material will have no net charge because the conductor was neutral, but wait, the conductor's inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. So the outer surface of the conductor (the outer sphere) has +q. So the field at a point outside the conductor (L > R) would be as if the charge +q is at the center. So again, E is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), option B.

So regardless of whether the conductor is a shell or a solid sphere, the field outside at P would be the same, because the outer surface's charge is +q and the charge is uniformly distributed (if the conductor is a sphere), so the field outside is as if all charge is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor in this problem is a spherical conductor with a cavity. So whether it's a shell or a solid sphere with a cavity, the result would be the same as the field outside depends on the charge on the outer surface.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). The other options involve l, s, and theta, but I don't see how those factors come into play.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about how the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the outer surface charge distribution. Wait, the conductor's outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution if the conductor is a sphere. But if the cavity is off-center and the conductor is a sphere, would that cause the outer surface charge to redistribute? Hmm, but no, because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charge would cause the inner surface to adjust, but the outer surface remains symmetric. Wait, no. Because the inner surface isn't symmetric. If the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be asymmetric. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would still have a uniform charge distribution if the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge is still +q, and the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Suppose the conductor is a solid sphere, and the cavity is off-center. The inner surface would have a non-uniform charge distribution (more charge near the direction of the charge inside the cavity). But the outer surface, because it's a sphere, would have a uniform charge distribution. So the outer surface still behaves as if all charge +q is at the center.

Thus, the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if the charge were at the center, leading to option B.

Hmm, but wait, another thought. What if the conductor's outer surface isn't a perfect sphere? No, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. So the charge distribution is uniform on the outer surface.

So even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface charge remains uniform. So the field outside is same as if the charge were at the center.

So the answer is option B.

The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The cavity is not at the center of the conductor but is separated by a distance $s$ from the center. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conductor Properties**: The conductor is neutral, meaning the total charge on the conductor itself is zero. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, the electric field at a point outside the conductor (where $L > R$) is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

3. **Irrelevance of the Cavity's Position**: The position of the cavity (and hence the charge $+q$ inside it) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, and the field outside depends only on this charge and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The variables $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ are irrelevant to the electric field at point $P$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the standard formula for the electric field outside a spherical conductor due to its outer surface charge.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. This expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While this resembles the electric field formula, it incorrectly uses $l^2$ instead of $L^2$.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
