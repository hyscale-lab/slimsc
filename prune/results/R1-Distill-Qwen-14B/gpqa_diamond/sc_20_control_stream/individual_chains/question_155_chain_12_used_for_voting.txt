Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I'll read the problem again. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Their matrix forms are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the states are diagonal in the P_z basis.

The system is found in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. Because the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the state is already diagonal in terms of P_z. Because each basis vector corresponds to a specific eigenvalue of P_z.

So, the state vector is a linear combination of the basis vectors, which are |ψ₁>, |ψ₂>, |ψ₃>, each being eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues probably ħ, 0, -ħ or something like that. Let me check the matrix of P_z. Oh, right, P_z's matrix is diagonal with (ħ, 0, -ħ) on the diagonal. So the basis vectors are |z=+ħ>, |z=0>, |z=-ħ>?

So the given state is a vector in this basis. The components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state is a combination of |z=+ħ>, |z=0>, and |z=-ħ>.

Wait, but the state is in the eigenstate of P_x, so it's an eigenvector of P_x, not P_z. That means when you measure P_x, you get a specific value, but for P_z, the state is a superposition of its eigenstates.

The uncertainty in P_z is the standard quantum mechanical uncertainty, calculated using the expectation values.

So, the formula for uncertainty is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, and P_z and P_x don't commute, the expectation values won't be zero. But let's proceed.

First, I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>, then plug into the formula.

So, the state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let's denote the basis as |1>, |2>, |3> where |1> is the eigenvector with eigenvalue ħ, |2> is the middle eigenstate (eigenvalue 0), and |3> is eigenvalue -ħ.

So, the state ψ is a combination of these. The coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

Because the basis is orthonormal, the expectation value of P_z is the sum of |c_n|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because the state is expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z, the expectation value <P_z> would be sum |c_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i).

Similarly, <P_z²> would be sum |c_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2, since P_z² |i> = (eigenvalue_i)^2 |i>.

Let me check: Since the state ψ is in the P_z basis, each component is an eigenstate of P_z. So yes, when you calculate <P_z>, it's the sum of |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i.

Let me compute each term.

So, the eigenvalues for each basis vector are:

For |1> → P_z |1> = ħ |1> → eigenvalue is ħ.

For |2> → P_z |2> = 0 |2> → eigenvalue 0.

For |3> → P_z |3> = -ħ |3> → eigenvalue -ħ.

So, the coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2=1/√2, c3=-1/2.

Compute |c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So, <P_z> = |c1|^2*(ħ) + |c2|^2*(0) + |c3|^2*(-ħ)

Which is (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0.

Wait, that's zero.

Now, <P_z^2> is |c1|^2*(ħ^2) + |c2|^2*(0) + |c3|^2*(ħ²).

So, that's (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ^2) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So when you measure P_x, you get -ħ for sure. But the uncertainty in P_z is about the spread in P_z measurements when the system is in this state.

But in this case, since the state is a combination of P_z eigenstates, the expectation values are as I calculated. So the uncertainty is indeed ħ/sqrt(2).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute P_z and P_z^2 matrices and calculate the expectation values.

Wait, no. Because in the P_z basis, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal. So the expectation value is simply c1^* c1 * (ħ) + c2^* c2 * 0 + c3^* c3 * (-ħ), which is the same as before.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the state is a vector in the P_z basis, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are |c_i|^2.

So, from that, the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we start by noting that the system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$. The state is given as the column vector $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)^T$, expressed in the basis of $P_z$'s eigenvectors. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis vectors $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively.

The coefficients of the state are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities $|c_i|^2$ are calculated as:
- $|c_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$,
- $|c_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$,
- $|c_3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.

The expectation value of $P_z$ is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0^2 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty in $P_z$ is given by:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$, corresponding to option **B**.
