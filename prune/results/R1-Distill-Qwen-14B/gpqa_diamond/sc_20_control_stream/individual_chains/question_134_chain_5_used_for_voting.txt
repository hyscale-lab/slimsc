Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when an acid reacts with a base, a neutralization reaction occurs, producing water and a salt. The enthalpy change for this reaction is what we're after.

Wait, but wait, the problem has three solutions. So I need to figure out which ones are the acids and which is the base. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid but diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So HCl and H2SO4 are the acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Typically, that's when an acid reacts with a base, like an acid-base reaction. But here, we have three solutions. Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess or if they neutralize each other.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of HCl. Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so each mole gives one mole of H+.

Next, the H2SO4. Its molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is a diprotic acid; each mole can provide two H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the Ba(OH)2. Its concentration is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole gives two OH- ions, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix these, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is what's considered the neutralization enthalpy. For strong acids and bases, the enthalpy change per mole is approximately the same, around -57 kJ/mol (I think it's about -57 kJ when they say "neutralization enthalpy per mole of H+"), but I should confirm.

Wait no, I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.1 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. So the total enthalpy change will be the moles of H+ (or OH-) that actually react multiplied by that value. But wait, sometimes it's based on the moles of acid and base, but in this case, since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, each mole gives two H+.

So let's compute total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + H2SO4's H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

So when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react. The limiting reagent here is OH- because 0.28 > 0.2. So all the OH- will react, and the excess H+ will remain.

So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2 moles. Moles of H+ remaining = 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But for the neutralization enthalpy, only the reacting H+ and OH- contribute. So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, releasing heat.

The neutralization enthalpy per mole is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, since the reaction is exothermic, it would be negative. So -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me double-check the molarity and moles calculations.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.
H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.
Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me look at the options.

Options: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait, wait. So my calculation says -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe I missed something.

Wait, another thought: Could this be a case where H2SO4 is treated differently? Because when H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ is strong, but the second is weaker. But in neutralization with a strong base, both H+ ions would react. Wait, but in the case of a neutralization reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, I think both H+ ions would react. But in this problem, we're mixing all three solutions together, so maybe the H2SO4 is fully reacting with the OH-.

Wait, but in the solution, I considered all H+ from H2SO4. However, in some cases, especially when dealing with diprotic acids reacting with bases, sometimes only the first H+ is considered for neutralization, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, in the problem, we're mixing all three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So all the OH- will react with H+ from both sources. So 0.2 moles of H+ are consumed, leaving 0.08 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (−57 kJ) = −11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-: 0.2 mol. Correct.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles react. 0.2 *57 =11.4, so −11.4 kJ.

But wait, the given options include B) -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, perhaps the neutralization enthalpy is given in kcal per mole.

Wait, converting 57 kJ to kcal: 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is approximately 57 /4.184 ≈13.61 kcal. So per mole of H+.

Wait, but that would complicate things. Let's see.

Wait, but the standard value for enthalpy of neutralization is about −57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH- involved. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed per mole of acid, but in the case of strong acids and strong bases, it's per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the total moles of H+ and OH-, find the minimum, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total H+ and OH-:

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

They will neutralize each other:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

The limiting reagent is OH-: 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Since it's exothermic, it's −11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the moles.

Wait, wait: another possibility. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two H+ from the acid. So, when H2SO4 (which gives 2 H+) reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 requires one mole of Ba(OH)2.

So perhaps I should split the problem into two parts: the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, and then what's left reacts with HCl.

Hmm, that's a possibility. Let me think.

So, first, the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1. Moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1, so H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react, requiring 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. So moles of Ba(OH)2 left: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

H2SO4 is completely consumed.

So now, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.02 mol OH-.

Additionally, we have the HCl solution: 0.1 mol H+.

So, the OH- from the remaining Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from HCl and H2SO4 (but H2SO4 is already all consumed, right? Because it was used up in the first reaction.)

Wait, H2SO4 was completely consumed in the first step, so the only H+ left is from HCl, which is 0.1 mol.

So, the OH- from the leftover Ba(OH)2 (0.02 mol) will react with H+ from HCl.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol. OH- is 0.02. So they react to produce 0.02 mol H2O, releasing heat.

So, first reaction: H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 → neutralization. Moles of H2O produced: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol? Wait, no, wait: the reaction produces 2 moles of H2O per mole of H2SO4. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H2O.

Second reaction: 0.02 mol OH- reacting with 0.02 mol H+ → 0.02 mol H2O.

So total H2O produced is 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.20 mol.

Wait, but this approach might be more accurate because considering the reactions step-wise. So the total moles of H2O formed is 0.20 mol.

Alternatively, wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Because when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will be in the same solution as the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the second approach is considering the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 first, and then the HCl. But in reality, when you mix all three, all the H+ and OH- are in the same solution, so they will react together, regardless of their source.

So, which approach is correct? I think it's the first approach, where total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles react, producing 0.2 moles H2O, releasing 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

But why are the options not matching? The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

So, -11.4 kJ would be approximately -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard enthalpy per mole is not 57 kJ but something else. Wait, another thought: Maybe the enthalpy per mole of acid or base used, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for a monoprotic acid and base, it's about 57 kJ per mole of acid. But for H2SO4, being diprotic, each mole would contribute 2 moles of H+, so the neutralization enthalpy would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H2O, which is 57 kJ per mole, so 0.2 moles would be 11.4 kJ.

So in that case, the answer would be -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match, and option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal). 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. If I have 0.2 moles of H2O, and each mole releases about 57 kJ, which is about 13.6 kcal (57 /4.184 ≈13.6). So 0.2 moles would be 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier I thought it was -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So the correct answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is there an option D which is -16.0 kJ? That would be if the calculation was for 0.28 moles reacting. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the neutralization. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, each mole gives two H+. So when it's mixed with Ba(OH)2, which gives two OH- per mole, perhaps the neutralization is on a 1:1 basis.

Wait, let me think about stoichiometry. So, when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. So, 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2 to produce 2 moles H2O. So, the moles of H2O would be 2 per mole of H2SO4 or Ba(OH)2.

But in this problem, we have 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent. So they produce 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles H2O.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. That gives 0.02 moles OH-.

Then, the HCl is 0.1 moles H+. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.02) will react with H+ from HCl (0.1) to produce 0.02 moles H2O.

So total H2O is 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.20 moles.

Each mole of H2O gives 57 kJ. So 0.20 *57 =11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

But wait, why the options don't have this. The options are either in kcal or kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 48.5 kJ (11.42 *4.184≈47.6, but that's not matching the 11.4 kJ). Wait, no: wait, 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal, as I thought earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is wrong and the correct approach is considering the neutralization step-wise.

So, in the first step, H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) + Ba(OH)2 (0.09 mol) → BaSO4 + 0.18 mol H2O. Enthalpy change for this is 0.18 *57 kJ =10.26 kJ. But wait, no, because each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-; the reaction produces 2 moles of H2O per mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 would produce 0.18 mol H2O, leading to 0.18 *57=10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, giving 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl has 0.1 mol H+.

So, OH- (0.02) + H+ (0.02) → 0.02 mol H2O, giving 0.02 *57=1.14 kJ.

Total: 10.26 + 1.14 =11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization in terms of equivalents. For HCl, each mole gives 1 equivalent (eq) of H+. For H2SO4, each mole gives 2 eq. For Ba(OH)2, each mole gives 2 eq of OH-.

So, total equivalents of H+ = (0.5 L *0.2 M)*1 + (0.3 L *0.3 M)*2 = (0.1) + (0.09 *2)=0.1 +0.18=0.28 eq.

Total equivalents of OH- = (0.2 L *0.5 M)*2 =0.2 eq.

So, the neutralization is min(0.28, 0.2) =0.2 eq.

So, the heat released is 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ.

So that's -11.4 kJ.

But in the options, D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps I'm using the wrong value for enthalpy.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is taken as -57.1 kcal/mol. Wait, 57.1 kcal is per mole, but that's a big number. Wait, 57.1 kcal is 57,100 calories, which is way too high. No, that can't be right.

Wait, no. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about −57.1 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) involved. So 57.1 kJ is per mole.

So, 0.2 moles would be 11.42 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.42 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait a moment. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is in calories instead of kilojoules.

Wait, I think I know where I went wrong. The problem is using calories instead of kilojoules. Wait, but the options have both. Let me clarify.

Wait, 1 kJ = 239.006 calories. So 57 kJ is about 57 * 239 ≈13,683 calories, which is 13.683 kcal.

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, 1 kJ is approximately 239 calories. So 57 kJ is 57 * 239 ≈13.683 kcal.

So, if the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, the enthalpy is 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 * 239 ≈2723 calories or about 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier I thought the answer was -11.4 kJ, which is option D not present. But the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the correct value is approximately -2.72 kcal, then the answer would be A. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recheck all the moles:

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L *0.2 M =0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL =0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 M =0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL =0.2 L. 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol.

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 *2=0.18 mol.

Total H+ =0.28 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 *2=0.2 mol.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles reacting: 0.2 mol.

So moles of H2O =0.2.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 *57.1 kJ =11.42 kJ.

But wait, 57.1 kJ is per mole of H+ (like for strong acid and strong base). So 0.2 moles H+ →0.2 *57.1 =11.42 kJ.

So the answer would be -11.42 kJ, but looking at the options, that's not present. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 49.5 kJ (11.42 *4.184 ≈47.61 kJ). So that's not matching.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy of neutralization in terms of per mole of H2O, which is about 57.1 kJ per mole. So 0.2 moles would be 11.42 kJ, which is -11.42 kJ. But that's not one of the options. The closest is option D) -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the dilution effect is considered, but the problem doesn't mention any temperature change due to dilution, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the reaction.

Wait, another approach: the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. Neutralization enthalpy is typically per mole of H+ or OH-.

But the options don't have 11.4 kJ. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in calories.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is −57,100 cal/mol (since 1 kJ is about 239 cal, so 57.1 kJ is 57,100 cal). But that seems too large.

Wait, no: 57.1 kJ is 57,100 J. To convert to calories, 1 cal =4.184 J, so 57,100 J /4.184 ≈13,610 cal, which is 13.61 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.61 =2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{HCl} \). Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂SO₄} \). As a diprotic acid, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{Ba(OH)₂} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) occurs between \( \text{H⁺} \) and \( \text{OH⁻} \). The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH⁻} \), as there are only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \) to react with \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} \). Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} \) and \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \) react, producing \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂O} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.1 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of \( \text{H₂O} \) formed. For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂O} \), the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.1 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.42 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Converting to calories (\( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 239 \, \text{cal} \)):
     \[
     -11.42 \, \text{kJ} \times 239 \, \text{cal/kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which matches option A.

ANSWER: A
