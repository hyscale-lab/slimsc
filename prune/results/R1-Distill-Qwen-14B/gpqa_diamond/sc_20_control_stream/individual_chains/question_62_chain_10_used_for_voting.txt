Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to a hydrogen). So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that structure. The main chain must be a cyclohexane ring. At position 1, there's a substituent: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the main ring has a carbaldehyde group. So, the main ring has both a substituent at position 1 and a formyl group (CHO) attached.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. The main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the CHO is attached to the cyclohexane ring. But the 1-position has another substituent: a cyclohexyl(methyl) with a hydroxyl. Or wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, the methyl group is connected to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH-cyclohexyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group where two of the substituents are hydroxyl and cyclohexyl. Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl) and (hydroxy) attached to a methyl group. So, it's -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the target molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1 that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a methyl group that has both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl attached.

Now, thinking about the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane: so the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH group. So, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group? Wait, ethynyl is -C≡C-H. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

Hmm. So, how can I get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule?

Let me think about the possible reactions. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group. So, maybe I need to add substituents to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the starting material only has one substituent: the ethynyl group. So, I need to add more substituents.

First, perhaps I should consider adding a cyclohexyl group. But how? Maybe through some kind of coupling reaction? Or maybe via some kind of nucleophilic substitution?

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynyl group can be functionalized in steps. Let me think about the possible steps.

Optionally, since the target has a formyl group (CHO), perhaps that comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol or maybe from a benzoin condensation or something else. Wait, but oxidation of a secondary alcohol gives a ketone, which is not aldehyde. So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, maybe I need to introduce an alcohol group somewhere.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe I can do some kind of hydration of the triple bond to get a diol or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can functionalize the triple bond into a ketone or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can perform a hydroboration or some addition to the triple bond. Or maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, but that doesn’t seem directly helpful.

Wait, the target has a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group with a hydroxyl. So, maybe that's a result of a Grignard reaction or a similar addition. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into something else. So, maybe first, the triple bond is deprotonated to form an alkyne with a good leaving group, like a methyl group. Then, perhaps a cyclohexyl group is added via substitution.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. Looking at the options, the first reagents in each option are either NaNH2 and methyl chloride or ethyl chloride, or methanol, etc.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. With methyl chloride, it's probably an alkylation. So, perhaps the triple bond is deprotonated by a strong base like NaNH2, making it a good nucleophile, which then attacks methyl chloride. That would add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, but I have ethynylcyclohexane. So, if I deprotonate the sp-hybridized C-H, I get a cyclohexyl-ethynide: cyclohexane-C-≡C^(-) with a negative charge. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with this, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So that would be propargylcyclohexane? Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C≡C-CH2 cyclohexane? Wait, no, perhaps adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)methylcyclopropane? No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. When treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), it deprotonates the sp-hybridized C-H, making it a strong base. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. So the resulting compound would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group. So that's a propargyl group attached to cyclohexane.

So after step 1 (NaNH2, methyl chloride), we get cyclohexylpropargyl something. Wait, the structure would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group. So, perhaps that's 1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene.

Wait, but the next step in the options varies. For example, option A's next step is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to a single bond, adding two Hs. So, the triple bond between the cyclohexane and CH3 would become a single bond. So, the cyclohexane would have a -CH2-CH3 group attached, but wait, that's not right. Wait, the triple bond was -C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would make it -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically go to a single bond, so adding two Hs to each carbon. So, the triple bond (sp-hybridized) becomes a single bond (sp³). So, in the case of -C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, the structure would be:

Original: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

After H2 and Pd: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, after hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd typically converts the triple bond into a single bond, adding two Hs across each carbon. So, the triple bond C≡C becomes a single bond with each carbon having two Hs. So, for the structure cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, the structure would be cyclohexane attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 which is attached to CH3? No, that can't be right because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, the structure after hydrogenation would be a single bond between the two carbons, each having two Hs. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. Starting with cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me imagine the structure: the cyclohexane is attached to a carbon (let's say carbon 1), which is triple bonded to another carbon (carbon 2), which is attached to a CH3. So, structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. After hydrogenation, each triple bond carbon (C1 and C2) gets two Hs. So, C1 becomes CH2, and C2 becomes CH2. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the three carbons are now a single chain: cyclohexane connected to CH2 connected to CH2 connected to CH3. So, the molecule becomes 1-cyclohexylpropane? Or wait, it's just a longer chain.

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via hydration. But the options don't show that as the second step.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making it a longer chain.

3. Ba(OH)2 → possibly a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in some elimination reactions or perhaps for epoxide ring opening. Alternatively, maybe it's for a oxidation. Or, perhaps it's for making a diol from an epoxide. Hmm, not certain. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, but that doesn't ring a bell.

Wait, the third step in option A is Ba(OH)2, and the fourth is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like the Tollen's reagent for oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a step in a elimination reaction, like the formation of epoxides or something else.

But perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne to add an ethyl group.

2. Li / liquid NH3 → that's a method for Birch reduction, which is used to reduce aromatic rings, but perhaps it's used for alkyne reductions as well? Or maybe it's for elimination reactions or something else.

3. O3 / H2O → ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → work up, perhaps to form aldehydes/ketones.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as before, alkylation.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation, perhaps selective hydrogenation.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (with (CH3)2S as a reductant, which would give aldehydes instead of breaking into smaller pieces, perhaps).

4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps alkylation with methanol as the methylating agent? Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but methanol is a poor electrophile unless under acidic conditions.

Wait, methanol as an alkylating agent would require a good base. So, with NaNH2, perhaps it's a deprotonation and then alkylation. But methanol is a primary alkylating agent, which under strong bases can O-alkylate, but in this case, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated and then alkylated by methanol to form a ethereal linkage? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the target molecule has a formyl group. So, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Let me think again about the possible steps.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane.

Perhaps I can do the following:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group, making it propargylcyclohexane.

2. Then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

3. Then, perform some kind of oxidation to introduce a carbonyl group.

But not sure.

Wait, the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps we need to introduce a carbonyl group.

Another approach: the triple bond could be converted into a carbonyl group.

How can that happen? Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond into carbonyl groups. But ozonolysis of a triple bond (alkyne) would give either diketones or something else, depending on the conditions.

Alternatively, oxidation of an internal alkyne can give a diketone, but that's under strong acidic conditions, perhaps with H2SO4, HgSO4 (like Jones' oxidation). Wait, but that would require a diol first.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: oxidation of an alkyne.

An alkyne under certain conditions can be oxidized to a diketone, which would require two ketone groups, but that's only possible if the alkyne is internal. In our case, the alkyne is terminal (as in ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group), so oxidation would give a ketone and a carboxylic acid, perhaps.

Wait, oxidation of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or H2SO4, HgSO4 would give a carboxylic acid. For example, HC≡C-R would oxidize to COOH group on R.

So, if the starting material is cyclohexane-C≡CH, oxidation would give cyclohexane-COOH.

But wait, the target molecule is a cyclohexane with a formyl group. Hmm, so if I can convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group, that could be the formyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps via a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, but that's typically for alkenes. Alternatively, maybe via a Markovnikov addition.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an enol ether, and then hydrolyzed to a ketone or aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, and then the double bond is epoxidized, and then opened to form a diol, which is then oxidized. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think of the target structure again. The target has a formyl group (CHO) on the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps that comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol attached to the ring.

So, maybe I can introduce a primary alcohol first, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But how to introduce a primary alcohol?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a primary alcohol via hydration. Wait, but the triple bond would become a diol if added to water, but that's for alkynes under certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: let me think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait no, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH3; after hydrogenation, it would become a single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Not sure how that helps.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. Ozonolysis of a single bond wouldn't do much. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated into a single bond, so maybe the molecule is now a single bond between the cyclohexane and a longer chain. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, not single bonds. So perhaps that's not the right step.

Hmm, this might not be the correct path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps methylating the alkyne. So, the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe that's not right. Wait, methanol is a poor electrophile unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol, perhaps O-alkylation. But I'm not sure.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → likely a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings, but maybe it's used here for something else. Alternatively, it's used for elimination reactions. Not sure.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but if the molecule doesn't have a double bond, that wouldn't do anything. So maybe step 2 creates a double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, a double bond is formed. Let me think: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong reducing agent. Wait, no, Li is a metal that can act as a reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for elimination. Or maybe it's used for deprotonation followed by some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the target again. The target has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that's a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. That suggests some kind of alkylation or substitution where a methyl group is attached to both.

Wait, perhaps a Grignard reagent is involved. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the target molecule has two rings: the main cyclohexane ring with the formyl group and the substituent which includes another cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening or via a substitution where a cyclohexyl group is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. But the starting material doesn't have a leaving group in that position.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps needed:

1. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with -C≡CH).

2. Need to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Also, need to introduce a formyl group (CHO) on the cyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne being oxidized. But earlier, I thought that the alkyne would oxidize to a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. Unless under controlled conditions.

Wait, maybe the oxidation is done in a way that only partially oxidizes the alkyne. For example, using a milder oxidizing agent to form a ketone or aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via some method.

Wait, perhaps ozonolysis of the alkyne. But ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives a diketone. For example, R-C≡C-R' → R-O=C-O-R' (maybe not, I'm not certain). Or perhaps it gives two carboxylic acids if the alkyne is terminal.

Wait, another thought: if I have a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond, perhaps I can perform a hydration to form a ketone. Wait, but hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone if it's a terminal alkyne. For example, HC≡C-R would become RC(OH)CH2OH under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts. Oh, yes, that's the conditions for the oxymercuration of alkynes. Oxymercuration of terminal alkynes gives ketones. So, perhaps that's a step.

Wait, but I don't see HgSO4 and H2SO4 in the reagents except in option A's fourth step. Let me see.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne to -C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → what does Ba(OH)2 do here? Maybe elimination or epoxide formation.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which is oxymercuration conditions.

But wait, if after step 2, the molecule is a single bond, then step 4 wouldn't do anything because it's not an alkyne anymore. So maybe option A isn't the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the target's substituent as a result of a substitution reaction.

Wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, but then I need a carbonyl group in the molecule.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, and then a Grignard reagent is added to form the substituent.

But to get the carbonyl group, perhaps I need to oxidize the alkyne.

Wait, let's think about each option's reagents again.

Option C:

Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds. So, if prior to this step, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkene, which would then be cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically go all the way to a single bond. But if the conditions are such that it stops at the cis-alkene (like using Lindlar's catalyst), but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, no, Pd is typically used for complete hydrogenation. So, after step 2, the alkyne would become a single bond, not an alkene. So, step 3, ozonolysis, wouldn't cleave anything because there's no double bond after step 2.

So option C might not be correct.

Option B:

Step 2 is Li/liq. NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, which is used to reduce aromatic rings. But the starting material is an alkyne attached to a cyclohexane. Maybe the Li in NH3 is used for a different purpose, like deprotonation to form a strong base.

Alternatively, Li in ammonia can be used for elimination reactions, such as forming alkenes from alcohols via E2 mechanisms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Li in NH3 is used for dehydrohalogenation or for forming alkenes via elimination. But without knowing the structure after step 1, it's hard to say.

Step 1 in option B is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, the alkyne is deprotonated and then ethyl chloride adds, giving a longer alkyne. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which might be used to eliminate a molecule of HCl or something else, forming a double bond. Wait, but I don't see a leaving group here.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the possible steps each option implies and see which makes sense to reach the target.

The target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation to an aldehyde.

Looking at option D:

Step 4 is NH4OH. That's a mild nucleophilic workup, perhaps for a Grignard or for an oxidation step.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group with a hydroxyl. So, perhaps that's formed via a Grignard addition, where a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, if I can form a ketone or aldehyde somewhere, then add a Grignard reagent.

But how?

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and then O-alkylate with methanol? So, the alkyne becomes an ether? Not sure.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → Birch reduction, but without an aromatic ring, so maybe it's used for elimination.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond, creating carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

But how does that help in forming the substituent and the aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to Grignard reaction.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to get the substituent.

But how to get the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is oxidized to a ketone again. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then epoxidized, and then the epoxide is opened to form a diol, which is oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. It's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

So, perhaps the aldehyde group is directly attached to the cyclohexane.

How can I get that from the starting alkyne.

Wait, perhaps via a two-step process: first, convert the alkyne to a carbonyl group, then reduce it to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a ketone via hydration, then the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe oxidation of the alkyne to a ketone, then further oxidation to a carboxylic acid, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But that seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via Ozonolysis. Wait, but for that, I need to have a double bond. So, perhaps I hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene, then perform ozonolysis.

Wait, but hydrogenating an alkyne to an alkene would require specific conditions, like using a poisoned catalyst to stop at the alkene. For example, Lindlar's catalyst (Pd with quinoline) would hydrogenate an alkyne to a cis-alkene. But if the reagent is H2/Pd, it would go all the way to the single bond. So, perhaps the reagent is H2 with a different catalyst.

Not sure.

But looking at the options, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a typical condition for full hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane.

Option B's step 2 is Li in NH3, which I'm not clear about.

Hmm, perhaps the target molecule's formyl group comes from the aldehyde being formed through some oxidation after introducing a suitable group.

Wait, another approach: the target has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. That suggests that a methyl group is attached to both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But that's not a common reaction unless it's a nucleophilic substitution with a complex leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a coupling reaction, like a Suzuki coupling, but that usually requires organoboron compounds.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition. If there's a carbonyl group, adding a Grignard reagent would form a new carbon-carbon bond. But then, how does the cyclohexyl group come in?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps after forming an epoxide, treatment with a nucleophile would open it, introducing a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack on a good leaving group. But I'm not seeing that in the steps.

Another thought: perhaps the substituent comes from a reduction of a ketone. If there's a ketone group, reducing it would form a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps an elimination reaction could form a double bond, but I'm not sure how that leads to the substituent.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of each option's overall process.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne with methyl chloride → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond → cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but without a double bond, this wouldn't do anything. So, maybe step 2 is wrong.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkene, not a single bond. So, maybe H2/Pd-CaCO3 selectively hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond. But I thought Pd would go all the way. Alternatively, maybe the catalyst is poisoned to stop at the alkene. But I'm not certain.

If step 2 produces an alkene, then step 3 (O3, (CH3)2S) would cleave it into carbonyl groups. For example, if the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe the initial alkyne after step 1 is converted into an internal alkyne, which upon hydrogenation (step 2) becomes an internal alkene. Then, ozonolysis (step 3) would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate it to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would do nothing, so maybe not.

Alternatively, the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehydes.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination or forming epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct path.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate the alkyne and then O-alkylation with methanol. So, the alkyne becomes OCH3 attached. But I'm not sure.

Wait, methanol as an electrophile under strong base conditions. Maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis? But then we'd have an ether, which doesn't fit the target.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, but the molecule isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it's a deprotonation followed by elimination.

3. Ozonolysis → cleavage of a double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

Hmm, not seeing the connection.

Wait, maybe the target's substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a methyl group is replaced by a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group.

But I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The target molecule has two new groups: the formyl group and the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent.

Perhaps the formyl group is from an oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the substituent comes from a Grignard addition.

So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Then, a Grignard reagent adds to the aldehyde, forming a new carbon chain.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a chain; it's all rings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But that's not a common reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about each step in each option and see which makes sense.

Let me outline each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond or epoxide.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones' oxidation.

So, after step 4, what happens? The molecule would be oxidized. But after step 2, it's a single bond. So, oxidation would perhaps break the single bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but oxidizing a single bond (like a CH2 group) would require it to be a carbon adjacent to a functional group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a Birch reduction, but I don't think Ba(OH)2 is used that way.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → propargylcyclohexane with ethyl.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3/H2O → cleave double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, after step 3, we'd have two carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH would protonate them. If the molecule is cleaved into two parts, maybe one part is an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how the substituent would form.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis would do nothing without a double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe O-alkylation, but I'm not certain.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → Birch reduction or elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleave double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm.

Another approach: think about the number of steps needed to form the substituent and the aldehyde.

The target has two substituents: a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps each comes from different steps.

The formyl group would require oxidation of a primary alcohol, which would come from a prior step. The substituent would come from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group or from a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to make a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the propargyl group to a primary alcohol.

3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

4. Perform a Grignard reaction to add the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl.

But I don't see that sequence in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a primary alcohol.

3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a substitution where the alkyne's terminal is replaced by a group containing a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl.

But that would require a good leaving group, which I don't see in the starting material.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the option where the steps involve alkylation, hydrogenation, and oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Looking again, option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate → single bond, so cyclohexylpropane.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so no cleavage.

4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond, but that's after ozonolysis, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Option D:

1. Alkylation with methanol → perhaps forms an ether.

2. Li/NH3 → Birch reduction, but without an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for elimination.

3. Ozonolysis → need a double bond.

4. Workup.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, a double bond is formed, which is then cleaved.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would do nothing, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, option D's step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, after deprotonating the alkyne, methanol would alkylate it. So, the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which could be a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation followed by elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, Li in ammonia is a strong base. If we have an ether group (OCH3), perhaps elimination could form an alkene. So, after step 2, maybe the molecule has a double bond.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which could be a workup to form aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction after the aldehyde is formed.

But without a clear path, I'm not confident.

After all this thinking, I think the correct option is C.

Wait, no, perhaps option C's step 2 is hydrogenation to a single bond, and then step 3 is ozonolysis, which doesn't do anything. So that's not right.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the formyl group coming from the alkyne being oxidized to a carboxylic acid, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But that would require multiple steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne being converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene (maybe using a poisoned catalyst).

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

4. Workup to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, looking at option C:

Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes or ketones, not carboxylic acids.

So, if step 2 produces an alkene, step 3 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a base. Not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess.

The target has a formyl group and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxy group. The substituent suggests a Grignard addition, perhaps. The formyl group suggests oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Looking at the options, option D's steps involve Grignard-like conditions (Li/NH3), which could form the substituent. Then, oxidation steps could form the aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

After this lengthy thought process, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride:** This step alkylates the alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd:** Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane with a -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ group.
3. **Ba(OH)₂:** This step is unclear but could involve elimination or epoxide formation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O:** These are conditions for Jones' oxidation, which typically oxidizes alcohols or alkenes. However, after step 2, the molecule lacks a functional group that would be oxidized further. This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B:**
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride:** Alkylation of the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃:** Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction, but the role of lithium in this context is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O:** Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH:** A mild nucleophilic workup, but the sequence does not clearly form the substituent or the aldehyde group.

#### **Option C:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride:** Alkylation of the alkyne, forming propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate:** Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane with a -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ group.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S:** Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, but there is no double bond in the molecule after step 2. This step does not contribute meaningfully to the synthesis.
4. **Ba(OH)₂:** A strong base, but its role in this sequence is unclear.

#### **Option D:**
1. **NaNH₂, methanol:** Methanol could alkylate the alkyne, but methanol is a poor electrophile under these conditions. The exact outcome is uncertain.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃:** Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction, but the molecule lacks an aromatic ring or a functional group that would benefit from this step.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S:** Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH:** A mild nucleophilic workup, but the sequence does not clearly form the substituent or the aldehyde group.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent. None of the options clearly and consistently achieve this. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the unclear role of ozonolysis in this sequence.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to a hydrogen). So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that structure. The main chain must be a cyclohexane ring. At position 1, there's a substituent: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the main ring has a carbaldehyde group. So, the main ring has both a substituent at position 1 and a formyl group (CHO) attached.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. The main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the CHO is attached to the cyclohexane ring. But the 1-position has another substituent: a cyclohexyl(methyl) with a hydroxyl. Or wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, the methyl group is connected to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH-cyclohexyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group where two of the substituents are hydroxyl and cyclohexyl. Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl) and (hydroxy) attached to a methyl group. So, it's -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the target molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1 that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a methyl group that has both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl attached.

Now, thinking about the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane: so the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH group. So, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group? Wait, ethynyl is -C≡C-H. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

Hmm. So, how can I get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule?

Let me think about the possible reactions. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group. So, maybe I need to add substituents to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the starting material only has one substituent: the ethynyl group. So, I need to add more substituents.

First, perhaps I should consider adding a cyclohexyl group. But how? Maybe through some kind of coupling reaction? Or maybe via some kind of nucleophilic substitution?

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynyl group can be functionalized in steps. Let me think about the possible steps.

Optionally, since the target has a formyl group (CHO), perhaps that comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol or maybe from a benzoin condensation or something else. Wait, but oxidation of a secondary alcohol gives a ketone, which is not aldehyde. So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, maybe I need to introduce an alcohol group somewhere.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe I can do some kind of hydration of the triple bond to get a diol or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can functionalize the triple bond into a ketone or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can perform a hydroboration or some addition to the triple bond. Or maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, but that doesn’t seem directly helpful.

Wait, the target has a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group with a hydroxyl. So, maybe that's a result of a Grignard reaction or a similar addition. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into something else. So, maybe first, the triple bond is deprotonated to form an alkyne with a good leaving group, like a methyl group. Then, perhaps a cyclohexyl group is added via substitution.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. Looking at the options, the first reagents in each option are either NaNH2 and methyl chloride or ethyl chloride, or methanol, etc.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. With methyl chloride, it's probably an alkylation. So, perhaps the triple bond is deprotonated by a strong base like NaNH2, making it a good nucleophile, which then attacks methyl chloride. That would add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, but I have ethynylcyclohexane. So, if I deprotonate the sp-hybridized C-H, I get a cyclohexyl-ethynide: cyclohexane-C-≡C^(-) with a negative charge. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with this, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So that would be propargylcyclohexane? Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C≡C-CH2 cyclohexane? Wait, no, perhaps adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)methylcyclopropane? No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. When treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), it deprotonates the sp-hybridized C-H, making it a strong base. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. So the resulting compound would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group. So that's a propargyl group attached to cyclohexane.

So after step 1 (NaNH2, methyl chloride), we get cyclohexylpropargyl something. Wait, the structure would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group. So, perhaps that's 1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene.

Wait, but the next step in the options varies. For example, option A's next step is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to a single bond, adding two Hs. So, the triple bond between the cyclohexane and CH3 would become a single bond. So, the cyclohexane would have a -CH2-CH3 group attached, but wait, that's not right. Wait, the triple bond was -C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would make it -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically go to a single bond, so adding two Hs to each carbon. So, the triple bond (sp-hybridized) becomes a single bond (sp³). So, in the case of -C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, the structure would be:

Original: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

After H2 and Pd: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, after hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd typically converts the triple bond into a single bond, adding two Hs across each carbon. So, the triple bond C≡C becomes a single bond with each carbon having two Hs. So, for the structure cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, the structure would be cyclohexane attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 which is attached to CH3? No, that can't be right because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, the structure after hydrogenation would be a single bond between the two carbons, each having two Hs. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. Starting with cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me imagine the structure: the cyclohexane is attached to a carbon (let's say carbon 1), which is triple bonded to another carbon (carbon 2), which is attached to a CH3. So, structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. After hydrogenation, each triple bond carbon (C1 and C2) gets two Hs. So, C1 becomes CH2, and C2 becomes CH2. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the three carbons are now a single chain: cyclohexane connected to CH2 connected to CH2 connected to CH3. So, the molecule becomes 1-cyclohexylpropane? Or wait, it's just a longer chain.

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via hydration. But the options don't show that as the second step.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making it a longer chain.

3. Ba(OH)2 → possibly a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in some elimination reactions or perhaps for epoxide ring opening. Alternatively, maybe it's for a oxidation. Or, perhaps it's for making a diol from an epoxide. Hmm, not certain. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, but that doesn't ring a bell.

Wait, the third step in option A is Ba(OH)2, and the fourth is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like the Tollen's reagent for oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a step in a elimination reaction, like the formation of epoxides or something else.

But perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne to add an ethyl group.

2. Li / liquid NH3 → that's a method for Birch reduction, which is used to reduce aromatic rings, but perhaps it's used for alkyne reductions as well? Or maybe it's for elimination reactions or something else.

3. O3 / H2O → ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → work up, perhaps to form aldehydes/ketones.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as before, alkylation.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation, perhaps selective hydrogenation.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (with (CH3)2S as a reductant, which would give aldehydes instead of breaking into smaller pieces, perhaps).

4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps alkylation with methanol as the methylating agent? Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but methanol is a poor electrophile unless under acidic conditions.

Wait, methanol as an alkylating agent would require a good base. So, with NaNH2, perhaps it's a deprotonation and then alkylation. But methanol is a primary alkylating agent, which under strong bases can O-alkylate, but in this case, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated and then alkylated by methanol to form a ethereal linkage? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the target molecule has a formyl group. So, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Let me think again about the possible steps.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane.

Perhaps I can do the following:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group, making it propargylcyclohexane.

2. Then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

3. Then, perform some kind of oxidation to introduce a carbonyl group.

But not sure.

Wait, the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps we need to introduce a carbonyl group.

Another approach: the triple bond could be converted into a carbonyl group.

How can that happen? Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond into carbonyl groups. But ozonolysis of a triple bond (alkyne) would give either diketones or something else, depending on the conditions.

Alternatively, oxidation of an internal alkyne can give a diketone, but that's under strong acidic conditions, perhaps with H2SO4, HgSO4 (like Jones' oxidation). Wait, but that would require a diol first.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: oxidation of an alkyne.

An alkyne under certain conditions can be oxidized to a diketone, which would require two ketone groups, but that's only possible if the alkyne is internal. In our case, the alkyne is terminal (as in ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group), so oxidation would give a ketone and a carboxylic acid, perhaps.

Wait, oxidation of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or H2SO4, HgSO4 would give a carboxylic acid. For example, HC≡C-R would oxidize to COOH group on R.

So, if the starting material is cyclohexane-C≡CH, oxidation would give cyclohexane-COOH.

But wait, the target molecule is a cyclohexane with a formyl group. Hmm, so if I can convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group, that could be the formyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps via a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, but that's typically for alkenes. Alternatively, maybe via a Markovnikov addition.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an enol ether, and then hydrolyzed to a ketone or aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, and then the double bond is epoxidized, and then opened to form a diol, which is then oxidized. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think of the target structure again. The target has a formyl group (CHO) on the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps that comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol attached to the ring.

So, maybe I can introduce a primary alcohol first, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But how to introduce a primary alcohol?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a primary alcohol via hydration. Wait, but the triple bond would become a diol if added to water, but that's for alkynes under certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: let me think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait no, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH3; after hydrogenation, it would become a single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Not sure how that helps.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. Ozonolysis of a single bond wouldn't do much. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated into a single bond, so maybe the molecule is now a single bond between the cyclohexane and a longer chain. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, not single bonds. So perhaps that's not the right step.

Hmm, this might not be the correct path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps methylating the alkyne. So, the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe that's not right. Wait, methanol is a poor electrophile unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol, perhaps O-alkylation. But I'm not sure.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → likely a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings, but maybe it's used here for something else. Alternatively, it's used for elimination reactions. Not sure.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but if the molecule doesn't have a double bond, that wouldn't do anything. So maybe step 2 creates a double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, a double bond is formed. Let me think: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong reducing agent. Wait, no, Li is a metal that can act as a reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for elimination. Or maybe it's used for deprotonation followed by some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the target again. The target has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that's a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. That suggests some kind of alkylation or substitution where a methyl group is attached to both.

Wait, perhaps a Grignard reagent is involved. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the target molecule has two rings: the main cyclohexane ring with the formyl group and the substituent which includes another cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening or via a substitution where a cyclohexyl group is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. But the starting material doesn't have a leaving group in that position.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps needed:

1. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with -C≡CH).

2. Need to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Also, need to introduce a formyl group (CHO) on the cyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne being oxidized. But earlier, I thought that the alkyne would oxidize to a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. Unless under controlled conditions.

Wait, maybe the oxidation is done in a way that only partially oxidizes the alkyne. For example, using a milder oxidizing agent to form a ketone or aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via some method.

Wait, perhaps ozonolysis of the alkyne. But ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives a diketone. For example, R-C≡C-R' → R-O=C-O-R' (maybe not, I'm not certain). Or perhaps it gives two carboxylic acids if the alkyne is terminal.

Wait, another thought: if I have a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond, perhaps I can perform a hydration to form a ketone. Wait, but hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone if it's a terminal alkyne. For example, HC≡C-R would become RC(OH)CH2OH under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts. Oh, yes, that's the conditions for the oxymercuration of alkynes. Oxymercuration of terminal alkynes gives ketones. So, perhaps that's a step.

Wait, but I don't see HgSO4 and H2SO4 in the reagents except in option A's fourth step. Let me see.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne to -C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → what does Ba(OH)2 do here? Maybe elimination or epoxide formation.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which is oxymercuration conditions.

But wait, if after step 2, the molecule is a single bond, then step 4 wouldn't do anything because it's not an alkyne anymore. So maybe option A isn't the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the target's substituent as a result of a substitution reaction.

Wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, but then I need a carbonyl group in the molecule.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, and then a Grignard reagent is added to form the substituent.

But to get the carbonyl group, perhaps I need to oxidize the alkyne.

Wait, let's think about each option's reagents again.

Option C:

Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds. So, if prior to this step, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkene, which would then be cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically go all the way to a single bond. But if the conditions are such that it stops at the cis-alkene (like using Lindlar's catalyst), but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, no, Pd is typically used for complete hydrogenation. So, after step 2, the alkyne would become a single bond, not an alkene. So, step 3, ozonolysis, wouldn't cleave anything because there's no double bond after step 2.

So option C might not be correct.

Option B:

Step 2 is Li/liq. NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, which is used to reduce aromatic rings. But the starting material is an alkyne attached to a cyclohexane. Maybe the Li in NH3 is used for a different purpose, like deprotonation to form a strong base.

Alternatively, Li in ammonia can be used for elimination reactions, such as forming alkenes from alcohols via E2 mechanisms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Li in NH3 is used for dehydrohalogenation or for forming alkenes via elimination. But without knowing the structure after step 1, it's hard to say.

Step 1 in option B is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, the alkyne is deprotonated and then ethyl chloride adds, giving a longer alkyne. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which might be used to eliminate a molecule of HCl or something else, forming a double bond. Wait, but I don't see a leaving group here.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the possible steps each option implies and see which makes sense to reach the target.

The target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation to an aldehyde.

Looking at option D:

Step 4 is NH4OH. That's a mild nucleophilic workup, perhaps for a Grignard or for an oxidation step.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group with a hydroxyl. So, perhaps that's formed via a Grignard addition, where a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, if I can form a ketone or aldehyde somewhere, then add a Grignard reagent.

But how?

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and then O-alkylate with methanol? So, the alkyne becomes an ether? Not sure.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → Birch reduction, but without an aromatic ring, so maybe it's used for elimination.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond, creating carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

But how does that help in forming the substituent and the aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to Grignard reaction.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to get the substituent.

But how to get the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is oxidized to a ketone again. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then epoxidized, and then the epoxide is opened to form a diol, which is oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. It's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

So, perhaps the aldehyde group is directly attached to the cyclohexane.

How can I get that from the starting alkyne.

Wait, perhaps via a two-step process: first, convert the alkyne to a carbonyl group, then reduce it to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a ketone via hydration, then the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe oxidation of the alkyne to a ketone, then further oxidation to a carboxylic acid, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But that seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via Ozonolysis. Wait, but for that, I need to have a double bond. So, perhaps I hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene, then perform ozonolysis.

Wait, but hydrogenating an alkyne to an alkene would require specific conditions, like using a poisoned catalyst to stop at the alkene. For example, Lindlar's catalyst (Pd with quinoline) would hydrogenate an alkyne to a cis-alkene. But if the reagent is H2/Pd, it would go all the way to the single bond. So, perhaps the reagent is H2 with a different catalyst.

Not sure.

But looking at the options, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a typical condition for full hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane.

Option B's step 2 is Li in NH3, which I'm not clear about.

Hmm, perhaps the target molecule's formyl group comes from the aldehyde being formed through some oxidation after introducing a suitable group.

Wait, another approach: the target has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. That suggests that a methyl group is attached to both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But that's not a common reaction unless it's a nucleophilic substitution with a complex leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a coupling reaction, like a Suzuki coupling, but that usually requires organoboron compounds.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition. If there's a carbonyl group, adding a Grignard reagent would form a new carbon-carbon bond. But then, how does the cyclohexyl group come in?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps after forming an epoxide, treatment with a nucleophile would open it, introducing a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack on a good leaving group. But I'm not seeing that in the steps.

Another thought: perhaps the substituent comes from a reduction of a ketone. If there's a ketone group, reducing it would form a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps an elimination reaction could form a double bond, but I'm not sure how that leads to the substituent.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of each option's overall process.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne with methyl chloride → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond → cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but without a double bond, this wouldn't do anything. So, maybe step 2 is wrong.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkene, not a single bond. So, maybe H2/Pd-CaCO3 selectively hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond. But I thought Pd would go all the way. Alternatively, maybe the catalyst is poisoned to stop at the alkene. But I'm not certain.

If step 2 produces an alkene, then step 3 (O3, (CH3)2S) would cleave it into carbonyl groups. For example, if the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe the initial alkyne after step 1 is converted into an internal alkyne, which upon hydrogenation (step 2) becomes an internal alkene. Then, ozonolysis (step 3) would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate it to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would do nothing, so maybe not.

Alternatively, the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehydes.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination or forming epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct path.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate the alkyne and then O-alkylation with methanol. So, the alkyne becomes OCH3 attached. But I'm not sure.

Wait, methanol as an electrophile under strong base conditions. Maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis? But then we'd have an ether, which doesn't fit the target.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, but the molecule isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it's a deprotonation followed by elimination.

3. Ozonolysis → cleavage of a double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

Hmm, not seeing the connection.

Wait, maybe the target's substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a methyl group is replaced by a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group.

But I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The target molecule has two new groups: the formyl group and the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent.

Perhaps the formyl group is from an oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the substituent comes from a Grignard addition.

So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Then, a Grignard reagent adds to the aldehyde, forming a new carbon chain.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a chain; it's all rings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But that's not a common reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about each step in each option and see which makes sense.

Let me outline each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond or epoxide.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones' oxidation.

So, after step 4, what happens? The molecule would be oxidized. But after step 2, it's a single bond. So, oxidation would perhaps break the single bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but oxidizing a single bond (like a CH2 group) would require it to be a carbon adjacent to a functional group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a Birch reduction, but I don't think Ba(OH)2 is used that way.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → propargylcyclohexane with ethyl.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3/H2O → cleave double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, after step 3, we'd have two carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH would protonate them. If the molecule is cleaved into two parts, maybe one part is an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how the substituent would form.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis would do nothing without a double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe O-alkylation, but I'm not certain.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → Birch reduction or elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleave double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm.

Another approach: think about the number of steps needed to form the substituent and the aldehyde.

The target has two substituents: a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps each comes from different steps.

The formyl group would require oxidation of a primary alcohol, which would come from a prior step. The substituent would come from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group or from a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to make a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the propargyl group to a primary alcohol.

3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

4. Perform a Grignard reaction to add the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl.

But I don't see that sequence in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a primary alcohol.

3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a substitution where the alkyne's terminal is replaced by a group containing a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl.

But that would require a good leaving group, which I don't see in the starting material.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the option where the steps involve alkylation, hydrogenation, and oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Looking again, option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate → single bond, so cyclohexylpropane.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so no cleavage.

4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond, but that's after ozonolysis, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Option D:

1. Alkylation with methanol → perhaps forms an ether.

2. Li/NH3 → Birch reduction, but without an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for elimination.

3. Ozonolysis → need a double bond.

4. Workup.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, a double bond is formed, which is then cleaved.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would do nothing, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, option D's step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, after deprotonating the alkyne, methanol would alkylate it. So, the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which could be a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation followed by elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, Li in ammonia is a strong base. If we have an ether group (OCH3), perhaps elimination could form an alkene. So, after step 2, maybe the molecule has a double bond.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which could be a workup to form aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction after the aldehyde is formed.

But without a clear path, I'm not confident.

After all this thinking, I think the correct option is C.

Wait, no, perhaps option C's step 2 is hydrogenation to a single bond, and then step 3 is ozonolysis, which doesn't do anything. So that's not right.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the formyl group coming from the alkyne being oxidized to a carboxylic acid, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But that would require multiple steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne being converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene (maybe using a poisoned catalyst).

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

4. Workup to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, looking at option C:

Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes or ketones, not carboxylic acids.

So, if step 2 produces an alkene, step 3 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a base. Not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess.

The target has a formyl group and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxy group. The substituent suggests a Grignard addition, perhaps. The formyl group suggests oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Looking at the options, option D's steps involve Grignard-like conditions (Li/NH3), which could form the substituent. Then, oxidation steps could form the aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

After this lengthy thought process, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride:** This step alkylates the alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd:** Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane with a -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ group.
3. **Ba(OH)₂:** This step is unclear but could involve elimination or epoxide formation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O:** These are conditions for Jones' oxidation, which typically oxidizes alcohols or alkenes. However, after step 2, the molecule lacks a functional group that would be oxidized further. This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B:**
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride:** Alkylation of the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃:** Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction, but the role of lithium in this context is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O:** Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH:** A mild nucleophilic workup, but the sequence does not clearly form the substituent or the aldehyde group.

#### **Option C:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride:** Alkylation of the alkyne, forming propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate:** Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane with a -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ group.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S:** Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, but there is no double bond in the molecule after step 2. This step does not contribute meaningfully to the synthesis.
4. **Ba(OH)₂:** A strong base, but its role in this sequence is unclear.

#### **Option D:**
1. **NaNH₂, methanol:** Methanol could alkylate the alkyne, but methanol is a poor electrophile under these conditions. The exact outcome is uncertain.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃:** Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction, but the molecule lacks an aromatic ring or a functional group that would benefit from this step.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S:** Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH:** A mild nucleophilic workup, but the sequence does not clearly form the substituent or the aldehyde group.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent. None of the options clearly and consistently achieve this. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the unclear role of ozonolysis in this sequence.
