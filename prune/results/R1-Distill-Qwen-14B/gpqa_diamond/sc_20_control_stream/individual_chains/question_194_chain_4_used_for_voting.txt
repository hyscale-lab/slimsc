Okay, so I have this physics problem about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try my best.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? And β is 1/(kT), so it's like the inverse temperature scaled by Boltzmann's constant.

First, I should figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. That's manageable because it's a small system.

Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. Let me list them out:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Next, for each state, I need to compute the energy E, then calculate exp(-βE), and sum all those up to get Z.

But wait, calculating each individually might not be the most efficient way. Maybe there's a smarter approach by considering the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H. So each term in the partition function will be exp(β J H), since E is negative.

Oh right, because exp(-β E) = exp(β J H). That's because E is -J H, so substituting, it's exp(β J H).

So, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(β J H_state), where H_state is the value of H for that state.

So, let's find what H is for each state.

Let me compute H for each state:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

2. (+1, +1, -1)
H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

3. (+1, -1, +1)
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. (+1, -1, -1)
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

5. (-1, +1, +1)
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

6. (-1, +1, -1)
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

7. (-1, -1, +1)
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. (-1, -1, -1)
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 +1 +1 = 3.

Hmm, so looking at the H values:

Only two states have H=3: states 1 and 8.

The other six states all have H=-1.

So, for each state, the value of H is either 3 or -1.

Now, compute the contribution of each state to Z.

Each state with H=3 contributes exp(β J * 3), because H=3.

Each state with H=-1 contributes exp(β J * (-1)) = exp(-β J).

So, how many states have H=3? Two.

How many have H=-1? Six.

So, the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3 β J) + 6 * exp(-β J)

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our H=3 term is exp(3β J), but option A has e^(-3Jβ) for the first term.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes, that's our expression.

Option C: Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ) → No, exponents are 2 instead of 3 and 1.

Option D: Z=6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ) → No, same problem.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up signs.

In the energy E, it's -J times H. So E = -J H.

So when H is positive 3, E is -3J. So the exponential is exp(-β E) = exp(3β J).

For H=-1, E is J. So exp(-β E) = exp(β J).

Wait, no. Wait.

E = -J H.

So when H=3, E = -3J.

So exp(-β E) = exp(3J β).

When H=-1, E = -J (-1) = J.

So exp(-β E) = exp(-β J).

Oh wait, I think I messed up earlier. Because when H is -1, E is J.

So exp(-β E) is exp(-J β).

So for the H=3 states (2 in number), each contributes e^{3J β}, and for the H=-1 states (6 in number), each contributes e^{-J β}.

So Z = 2 e^{3J β} + 6 e^{-J β}.

Which is option B.

So the correct answer is B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), and the partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the system. Each state corresponds to a unique combination of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). These states are:

1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

### Step 2: Compute the energy for each state
The energy \( E \) depends on \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), so we calculate \( H \) for each state:

1. \( (+1, +1, +1): H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1): H = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1): H = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1): H = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1): H = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1): H = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1): H = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1): H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)

Thus, \( H = 3 \) for two states and \( H = -1 \) for the remaining six states.

### Step 3: Compute contributions to the partition function
The energy \( E \) is related to \( H \) by \( E = -JH \). Substituting this into the partition function:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{\beta J H}.
\]

For \( H = 3 \), each state contributes \( e^{\beta J \cdot 3} \), and there are 2 such states. For \( H = -1 \), each state contributes \( e^{\beta J \cdot (-1)} = e^{-\beta J} \), and there are 6 such states. Therefore:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.)
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (Correct, matches the derived expression.)
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, exponents are 2 instead of 3 and 1.)
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, exponents and coefficients are wrong.)

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
