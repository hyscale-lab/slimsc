Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. So, the question is about determining the correct IUPAC name of a benzene ring with multiple substituents. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The benzene ring has three substituents that are meta to each other. Wait, no, the question says that a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group are all meta to one another. Hmm, so each of these three groups is positioned such that they are meta (1,3 positions) relative to each other? Or perhaps each pair is meta? That's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says all three are meta to one another. So the three groups—carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (formyl), and cyano—are each separated by one carbon (so 1,3 positions relative to each other). Wait, no, that can't be right because if all three are meta, their arrangement would require specific positions.

Wait, perhaps it's that each pair is meta? Or perhaps the three substituents are arranged in such a way that each is meta to the others. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If three substituents are all meta, they must be in positions 1, 3, and 5? Because each is separated by two carbons. Wait, no, because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, but 1 and 5 are adjacent, so that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to at least one of the others. Maybe the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the formyl in 3, and the cyano in 5. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Wait, the next part of the question says: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, the carboxylic acid is in a position where it has two substituents in the ortho positions. That means the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, no, because ortho to position 1 would be 2 and 6. So, the substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid are hydroxyl (OH) and dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2).

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position to position 1 is position 4. So, the methoxy (OCH3) is at position 4.

But wait, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are also both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, so the nitrile group is at a position where both OCH3 and OH are ortho to it. Let me think. So the nitrile (CN) must be in a position such that two of its ortho positions are where OCH3 and OH are located.

Wait, let me try to sketch this out. Let's imagine the numbering of the benzene ring.

Let me start by placing the carboxylic acid (COOH) as the principal functional group, so it gets the lowest possible number, which would be position 1. Then, the substituents ortho to COOH are position 2 (OH) and position 6 (NMe2—dimethyl amino). Para to COOH is position 4, which is OMe (methoxy).

Now, the other groups: the formyl (CHO) and cyano (CN) are meta to each other and to COOH. Wait, no, the question says all three (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to one another. Wait, that's not possible because each would have to be 1,3,5 in a six-membered ring, which isn't possible because 1 and 5 are adjacent. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial arrangement.

Wait, the problem says the benzene has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So each of these three groups is at a position such that any two are meta (i.e., 1,3 positions apart).

Wait, in a benzene ring, for three substituents to all be meta to each other, each pair must be in meta positions. So, for example, substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 3, substituent C at position 5. Because 1 and 3 are meta (two carbons apart), 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are two carbons apart as well. Wait, 5 and 1 are adjacent in a six-membered ring because it's a ring. So 5 is adjacent to 1, so that's not meta. So that arrangement doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that each substituent is meta to one other substituent, but not all three. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this part.

Wait, maybe COOH is in position 1, CHO is in position 3, and CN is in position 5. But then, let's check their positions. 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta (since 3 and 5 are two apart), and 5 and 1 are adjacent. So that doesn't satisfy all being meta to each other.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the arrangement isn't all three substituents being each meta to the others, but that each substituent is meta to one of the others. Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to another, but in a triangle on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the substituents and their positions based on the other information.

We have COOH as the principal functional group, so it's position 1. Then, ortho to COOH are OH (position 2) and NMe2 (position 6). Para to COOH is OMe (position 4). 

Now, the other substituents are CHO and CN. The question states that all three (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other. So, that would mean that COOH (1) is meta to both CHO and CN. Let's say, for example, COOH is at 1. Then, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. So, perhaps CHO is at 3 and CN at 5. Or vice versa.

Wait, but then CHO and CN would be at 3 and 5. Are those positions meta to each other? Because 3 and 5 are two apart (so they are meta in a six-membered ring). So, if COOH is at 1, CHO at 3, and CN at 5, that would make each pair meta. 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are adjacent—no, wait, that doesn't work because 5 is adjacent to 1. Hmm, that doesn't satisfy all three being meta to each other.

Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged so that each is meta to another, but not all three together. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged as follows:

COOH at position 1.

CHO at position 4—wait, but position 4 is para to COOH, which is already occupied by OMe. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe COOH is at position 2. Hmm, but then the principal functional group would be the last to get the number, so perhaps COOH is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that COOH is at position 1.

Ortho substituents: 2 (OH) and 6 (NMe2).

Para substituent: 4 (OMe).

Now, the other groups are formyl (CHO) and CN. They're meta to each other and to COOH.

Wait, so COOH is at 1. The meta positions would be 3 and 5. So perhaps CHO is at 3 and CN at 5. Are 3 and 5 meta to each other? Let's see: positions 3 and 5 are two apart, so yes, they're meta. So that would satisfy all three being meta to each other. Because 1 (COOH) is meta to 3 (CHO), 3 is meta to 5 (CN), and 5 is meta to 1? Wait, no. Because 5 is adjacent to 1, so 5 and 1 are not meta. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe COOH is at position 3. Then, meta positions would be 1 and 5. So, perhaps CHO is at 1, CN at 5. But then COOH is at 3, which is meta to both 1 and 5. But then, the question says that the other substituents are ortho to the COOH. So, if COOH is at 3, the substituents ortho would be at 2 and 4. But the substituents ortho to COOH are OH and NMe2. So COOH has to be in a position where its ortho positions are available.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach. Let's assign the substituents based on the given information.

The main substituent is the carboxylic acid (COOH), which is the principal functional group, so it will have the lowest possible number. So COOH is at position 1.

Ortho to COOH (1) are positions 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6.

At position 2: OH (hydroxyl).

At position 6: NMe2 (dimethylamino group).

Para to COOH (position 1) is position 4: OMe (methoxy).

Now, the other substituents are CHO (formyl) and CN (cyano). These are meta to each other and to COOH.

So COOH is at 1. Therefore, the meta positions are 3 and 5.

So, either CHO is at 3 and CN at 5, or vice versa.

Now, the question also states that the methoxy (OMe at 4) and the hydroxyl (OH at 2) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So CN must be in a position where both OMe (4) and OH (2) are ortho to it.

Wait, let's see: nitrile is at position 5. Its ortho positions are 4 and 6. So if nitrile is at 5, then positions 4 and 6 are ortho. So OMe is at 4 (so that's ortho to 5), and OH is at 2. Wait, but 2 is not adjacent to 5. Let me check the positions.

If the nitrile is at position 5, then its ortho positions are 4 and 6. OMe is at 4, which is ortho to 5. But OH is at 2—so is 2 adjacent to 5? Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions are arranged as 1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3, 4 (OMe), 5, 6 (NMe2). So 5 is next to 4 and 6. So, if CN is at 5, then the ortho positions are 4 and 6. OMe is at 4 (so that's ortho to 5), and NMe2 is at 6 (ortho to 5). But the question says that the OMe and OH are both ortho to the CN. So OH is at 2; is 2 adjacent to 5? No, because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3,4,5,6 go around. So 5 is next to 4 and 6. So 2 is two positions away from 5. So if CN is at 5, then the ortho substituents would be 4 and 6, which are OMe and NMe2. But the question says that OH and OMe are ortho to CN. So that doesn't fit because OH is at 2, which is not adjacent to 5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in placing the substituents. Let's try placing CN at position 3.

So if CN is at 3, its ortho positions would be 2 and 4.

At position 2: OH (so that's ortho to CN).

At position 4: OMe (which is also ortho to CN). That fits the condition that both OMe and OH are ortho to CN.

So CN is at 3, OH at 2, OMe at 4.

So, putting it all together:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO?

Wait, no, because earlier we thought that COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta to each other.

So COOH is at 1, CN at 3, so meta. CHO then would be at 5, which is meta to 1 (since 1 and 5 are two apart in a ring of six? Wait, no. In a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 1's meta is 3, 5 is meta to 3, but what about 1 and 5? 1 and 5 are opposite each other? Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, the para position is four away. So 1 and 5 are two apart, which is meta, because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, 5 and 1 are also meta? No, because 5 is two positions away from 1, which is the same as meta.

Wait, in a benzene ring, each position has two ortho (adjacent), two meta (two apart), and one para (three apart—opposite). So, 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 4 are para, 1 and 5 are meta. So, if COOH is at 1, CN is at 3, then CHO could be at 5, which is meta to 1 and meta to 3. So that satisfies the condition that all three (COOH, CN, and CHO) are meta to each other.

So putting it all together:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO

6: NMe2

Wait, that can't be right because position 6 is ortho to COOH (1), which has NMe2. That works.

So now, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO

6: NMe2

Now, let's check all the conditions.

- COOH (1) has ortho substituents OH (2) and NMe2 (6). Correct.

- Para to COOH is OMe (4). Correct.

- CHO is at 5. It's meta to COOH (1) and meta to CN (3).

- CN is at 3, which is meta to COOH (1) and to CHO (5).

- The methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to CN (3). Indeed, 2 and 4 are adjacent to 3.

So all the conditions are satisfied.

Now, the IUPAC name will be based on the substituents in the order of priority.

The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the parent is benzoic acid.

The substituents are numbered based on the principal group (COOH at position 1).

The substituents are:

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OMe

Position 5: CHO (formyl)

Position 6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering should give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Let me check the numbering to see if we can get lower numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering should start elsewhere. But since COOH is the principal group, it's fixed at position 1. So the numbering is as above.

Now, the substituents are numbered in the order of their positions: 2,3,4,5,6.

The substituents in order of priority (based on alphabetical order, but the numerical order in the name is based on their position numbers).

The substituents present are:

- Dimethylamino (NMe2) at position 6.

- Formyl (CHO) at position 5.

- Hydroxyl (OH) at 2.

- Methoxy (OCH3) at 4.

- Cyano (CN) at 3.

Wait, but the correct order in the name is based on alphabetical order of the substituents' names, but their position in the name depends on which substituent comes first alphabetically.

Wait, I think the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their position numbers are as per their placement.

Wait, no, the substituents are listed in the order of their position numbers, from lowest to highest, but their names are arranged alphabetically. Wait, no, the substituents are listed in the order of their positions, not alphabetically. For example, the substituent with the lowest number comes first, then the next, etc.

But wait, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order when naming, but their position numbers are based on the direction that gives the lowest set of numbers. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, the correct IUPAC rules state that substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the order in the name is based on the alphabetical order of the substituent names, not their position numbers. So the substituent with the earliest letter comes first.

So the substituents here are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Alphabetical order would be:

- Cyano (C comes before D, F, H, M)

So the substituents in alphabetical order are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Now, for each substituent, their positions are as follows:

- Cyano (CN) at position 3.

- Dimethylamino (NMe2) at 6.

- Formyl (CHO) at 5.

- Hydroxyl (OH) at 2.

- Methoxy (OCH3) at 4.

But in the name, after the substituent order, their positions are given in the order of the substituents. So the substituent with the first letter is named first, along with its position, followed by the next substituent and position, etc.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their position numbers are their actual positions on the ring. So for example, the name would start with 2-hydroxy..., then 3-cyano..., etc.

Wait, perhaps I should list the substituents in alphabetical order, each with their position.

So substituents:

1. Cyano (CN) at 3.

2. Dimethylamino at 6.

3. Formyl at 5.

4. Hydroxyl at 2.

5. Methoxy at 4.

Wait, no. Alphabetically, the substituents are:

- 3-cyano,

- 2-hydroxy,

- 4-methoxy,

-5-formyl,

-6-(dimethylamino).

Wait, but when listing them alphabetically, it's based on the substituent name, regardless of their position.

So the substituents in alphabetical order are:

1. 3-cyano.

2. 2-hydroxy.

3. 4-methoxy.

4. 5-formyl.

5. 6-(dimethylamino).

Wait, but substituent names are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

So the order is:

Cyano comes first.

Then comes dimethylamino.

Wait, wait, no. Alphabetically:

C (cyano) comes before D (dimethylamino), which comes before F (formyl), then H (hydroxyl), then M (methoxy).

So the order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

So in the name, each substituent is mentioned in this order, each with their respective position numbers.

So the name starts with benzoic acid. Then, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each with their position.

But let's think about how the name is formed.

The base is benzoic acid. Then, the substituents are added as prefixes.

So the substituents are:

At position 2: hydroxyl.

At position 3: cyano.

At position 4: methoxy.

At position 5: formyl.

At position 6: dimethylamino.

But when listing them in alphabetical order, the order is cyano (3), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxyl (2), methoxy (4).

Wait, but the substituent order in the name is alphabetical, not based on position.

Wait, no, the substituent order in the IUPAC name is determined by the alphabetical order of their substituent names. So first comes cyano, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

But each substituent is preceded by its position number. So the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, let me check the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That matches our conclusion.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, the order here is hydroxy first, then cyano, which is incorrect because 'cyano' comes before 'hydroxyl' alphabetically.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid. No, because dimethylamino comes earlier alphabetically than formyl, which it doesn't in alphabetical order.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. No, because cyano is at 5, which doesn't fit our substituent positions.

So the correct name is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The molecule is a benzene ring with multiple substituents arranged as follows:

1. **Principal functional group**: The carboxylic acid (COOH) is at position 1, as it is the principal functional group and must have the lowest possible number.

2. **Substituents ortho to COOH**: 
   - At position 2: Hydroxyl (OH).
   - At position 6: Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂).

3. **Substituent para to COOH**: At position 4: Methoxy (OCH₃).

4. **Other substituents**: 
   - Cyanide (CN) at position 3.
   - Formyl (CHO) at position 5.

The arrangement satisfies the conditions:
- The carboxylic acid, cyanide, and formyl are all meta to each other.
- The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the cyanide.

### IUPAC Naming:
The substituents are listed in alphabetical order of their names, regardless of their positions:
1. **Cyano (CN)** at position 3.
2. **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)** at position 6.
3. **Formyl (CHO)** at position 5.
4. **Hydroxyl (OH)** at position 2.
5. **Methoxy (OCH₃)** at position 4.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: Correct. Matches the derived name.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Substituents are listed out of alphabetical order.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Substituents are listed out of alphabetical order and positions are mismatched.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Cyanide is incorrectly placed at position 5.

Answer: A

Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. So, the question is about determining the correct IUPAC name of a benzene ring with multiple substituents. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The benzene ring has three substituents that are meta to each other. Wait, no, the question says that a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group are all meta to one another. Hmm, so each of these three groups is positioned such that they are meta (1,3 positions) relative to each other? Or perhaps each pair is meta? That's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says all three are meta to one another. So the three groups—carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (formyl), and cyano—are each separated by one carbon (so 1,3 positions relative to each other). Wait, no, that can't be right because if all three are meta, their arrangement would require specific positions.

Wait, perhaps it's that each pair is meta? Or perhaps the three substituents are arranged in such a way that each is meta to the others. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If three substituents are all meta, they must be in positions 1, 3, and 5? Because each is separated by two carbons. Wait, no, because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, but 1 and 5 are adjacent, so that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to at least one of the others. Maybe the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the formyl in 3, and the cyano in 5. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Wait, the next part of the question says: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, the carboxylic acid is in a position where it has two substituents in the ortho positions. That means the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, no, because ortho to position 1 would be 2 and 6. So, the substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid are hydroxyl (OH) and dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2).

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position to position 1 is position 4. So, the methoxy (OCH3) is at position 4.

But wait, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are also both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, so the nitrile group is at a position where both OCH3 and OH are ortho to it. Let me think. So the nitrile (CN) must be in a position such that two of its ortho positions are where OCH3 and OH are located.

Wait, let me try to sketch this out. Let's imagine the numbering of the benzene ring.

Let me start by placing the carboxylic acid (COOH) as the principal functional group, so it gets the lowest possible number, which would be position 1. Then, the substituents ortho to COOH are position 2 (OH) and position 6 (NMe2—dimethyl amino). Para to COOH is position 4, which is OMe (methoxy).

Now, the other groups: the formyl (CHO) and cyano (CN) are meta to each other and to COOH. Wait, no, the question says all three (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to one another. Wait, that's not possible because each would have to be 1,3,5 in a six-membered ring, which isn't possible because 1 and 5 are adjacent. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial arrangement.

Wait, the problem says the benzene has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So each of these three groups is at a position such that any two are meta (i.e., 1,3 positions apart).

Wait, in a benzene ring, for three substituents to all be meta to each other, each pair must be in meta positions. So, for example, substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 3, substituent C at position 5. Because 1 and 3 are meta (two carbons apart), 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are two carbons apart as well. Wait, 5 and 1 are adjacent in a six-membered ring because it's a ring. So 5 is adjacent to 1, so that's not meta. So that arrangement doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that each substituent is meta to one other substituent, but not all three. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this part.

Wait, maybe COOH is in position 1, CHO is in position 3, and CN is in position 5. But then, let's check their positions. 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta (since 3 and 5 are two apart), and 5 and 1 are adjacent. So that doesn't satisfy all being meta to each other.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the arrangement isn't all three substituents being each meta to the others, but that each substituent is meta to one of the others. Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to another, but in a triangle on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the substituents and their positions based on the other information.

We have COOH as the principal functional group, so it's position 1. Then, ortho to COOH are OH (position 2) and NMe2 (position 6). Para to COOH is OMe (position 4). 

Now, the other substituents are CHO and CN. The question states that all three (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other. So, that would mean that COOH (1) is meta to both CHO and CN. Let's say, for example, COOH is at 1. Then, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. So, perhaps CHO is at 3 and CN at 5. Or vice versa.

Wait, but then CHO and CN would be at 3 and 5. Are those positions meta to each other? Because 3 and 5 are two apart (so they are meta in a six-membered ring). So, if COOH is at 1, CHO at 3, and CN at 5, that would make each pair meta. 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are adjacent—no, wait, that doesn't work because 5 is adjacent to 1. Hmm, that doesn't satisfy all three being meta to each other.

Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged so that each is meta to another, but not all three together. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged as follows:

COOH at position 1.

CHO at position 4—wait, but position 4 is para to COOH, which is already occupied by OMe. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe COOH is at position 2. Hmm, but then the principal functional group would be the last to get the number, so perhaps COOH is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that COOH is at position 1.

Ortho substituents: 2 (OH) and 6 (NMe2).

Para substituent: 4 (OMe).

Now, the other groups are formyl (CHO) and CN. They're meta to each other and to COOH.

Wait, so COOH is at 1. The meta positions would be 3 and 5. So perhaps CHO is at 3 and CN at 5. Are 3 and 5 meta to each other? Let's see: positions 3 and 5 are two apart, so yes, they're meta. So that would satisfy all three being meta to each other. Because 1 (COOH) is meta to 3 (CHO), 3 is meta to 5 (CN), and 5 is meta to 1? Wait, no. Because 5 is adjacent to 1, so 5 and 1 are not meta. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe COOH is at position 3. Then, meta positions would be 1 and 5. So, perhaps CHO is at 1, CN at 5. But then COOH is at 3, which is meta to both 1 and 5. But then, the question says that the other substituents are ortho to the COOH. So, if COOH is at 3, the substituents ortho would be at 2 and 4. But the substituents ortho to COOH are OH and NMe2. So COOH has to be in a position where its ortho positions are available.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach. Let's assign the substituents based on the given information.

The main substituent is the carboxylic acid (COOH), which is the principal functional group, so it will have the lowest possible number. So COOH is at position 1.

Ortho to COOH (1) are positions 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6.

At position 2: OH (hydroxyl).

At position 6: NMe2 (dimethylamino group).

Para to COOH (position 1) is position 4: OMe (methoxy).

Now, the other substituents are CHO (formyl) and CN (cyano). These are meta to each other and to COOH.

So COOH is at 1. Therefore, the meta positions are 3 and 5.

So, either CHO is at 3 and CN at 5, or vice versa.

Now, the question also states that the methoxy (OMe at 4) and the hydroxyl (OH at 2) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So CN must be in a position where both OMe (4) and OH (2) are ortho to it.

Wait, let's see: nitrile is at position 5. Its ortho positions are 4 and 6. So if nitrile is at 5, then positions 4 and 6 are ortho. So OMe is at 4 (so that's ortho to 5), and OH is at 2. Wait, but 2 is not adjacent to 5. Let me check the positions.

If the nitrile is at position 5, then its ortho positions are 4 and 6. OMe is at 4, which is ortho to 5. But OH is at 2—so is 2 adjacent to 5? Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions are arranged as 1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3, 4 (OMe), 5, 6 (NMe2). So 5 is next to 4 and 6. So, if CN is at 5, then the ortho positions are 4 and 6. OMe is at 4 (so that's ortho to 5), and NMe2 is at 6 (ortho to 5). But the question says that the OMe and OH are both ortho to the CN. So OH is at 2; is 2 adjacent to 5? No, because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3,4,5,6 go around. So 5 is next to 4 and 6. So 2 is two positions away from 5. So if CN is at 5, then the ortho substituents would be 4 and 6, which are OMe and NMe2. But the question says that OH and OMe are ortho to CN. So that doesn't fit because OH is at 2, which is not adjacent to 5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in placing the substituents. Let's try placing CN at position 3.

So if CN is at 3, its ortho positions would be 2 and 4.

At position 2: OH (so that's ortho to CN).

At position 4: OMe (which is also ortho to CN). That fits the condition that both OMe and OH are ortho to CN.

So CN is at 3, OH at 2, OMe at 4.

So, putting it all together:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO?

Wait, no, because earlier we thought that COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta to each other.

So COOH is at 1, CN at 3, so meta. CHO then would be at 5, which is meta to 1 (since 1 and 5 are two apart in a ring of six? Wait, no. In a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 1's meta is 3, 5 is meta to 3, but what about 1 and 5? 1 and 5 are opposite each other? Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, the para position is four away. So 1 and 5 are two apart, which is meta, because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, 5 and 1 are also meta? No, because 5 is two positions away from 1, which is the same as meta.

Wait, in a benzene ring, each position has two ortho (adjacent), two meta (two apart), and one para (three apart—opposite). So, 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 4 are para, 1 and 5 are meta. So, if COOH is at 1, CN is at 3, then CHO could be at 5, which is meta to 1 and meta to 3. So that satisfies the condition that all three (COOH, CN, and CHO) are meta to each other.

So putting it all together:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO

6: NMe2

Wait, that can't be right because position 6 is ortho to COOH (1), which has NMe2. That works.

So now, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO

6: NMe2

Now, let's check all the conditions.

- COOH (1) has ortho substituents OH (2) and NMe2 (6). Correct.

- Para to COOH is OMe (4). Correct.

- CHO is at 5. It's meta to COOH (1) and meta to CN (3).

- CN is at 3, which is meta to COOH (1) and to CHO (5).

- The methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to CN (3). Indeed, 2 and 4 are adjacent to 3.

So all the conditions are satisfied.

Now, the IUPAC name will be based on the substituents in the order of priority.

The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the parent is benzoic acid.

The substituents are numbered based on the principal group (COOH at position 1).

The substituents are:

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OMe

Position 5: CHO (formyl)

Position 6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering should give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Let me check the numbering to see if we can get lower numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering should start elsewhere. But since COOH is the principal group, it's fixed at position 1. So the numbering is as above.

Now, the substituents are numbered in the order of their positions: 2,3,4,5,6.

The substituents in order of priority (based on alphabetical order, but the numerical order in the name is based on their position numbers).

The substituents present are:

- Dimethylamino (NMe2) at position 6.

- Formyl (CHO) at position 5.

- Hydroxyl (OH) at 2.

- Methoxy (OCH3) at 4.

- Cyano (CN) at 3.

Wait, but the correct order in the name is based on alphabetical order of the substituents' names, but their position in the name depends on which substituent comes first alphabetically.

Wait, I think the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their position numbers are as per their placement.

Wait, no, the substituents are listed in the order of their position numbers, from lowest to highest, but their names are arranged alphabetically. Wait, no, the substituents are listed in the order of their positions, not alphabetically. For example, the substituent with the lowest number comes first, then the next, etc.

But wait, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order when naming, but their position numbers are based on the direction that gives the lowest set of numbers. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, the correct IUPAC rules state that substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the order in the name is based on the alphabetical order of the substituent names, not their position numbers. So the substituent with the earliest letter comes first.

So the substituents here are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Alphabetical order would be:

- Cyano (C comes before D, F, H, M)

So the substituents in alphabetical order are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Now, for each substituent, their positions are as follows:

- Cyano (CN) at position 3.

- Dimethylamino (NMe2) at 6.

- Formyl (CHO) at 5.

- Hydroxyl (OH) at 2.

- Methoxy (OCH3) at 4.

But in the name, after the substituent order, their positions are given in the order of the substituents. So the substituent with the first letter is named first, along with its position, followed by the next substituent and position, etc.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their position numbers are their actual positions on the ring. So for example, the name would start with 2-hydroxy..., then 3-cyano..., etc.

Wait, perhaps I should list the substituents in alphabetical order, each with their position.

So substituents:

1. Cyano (CN) at 3.

2. Dimethylamino at 6.

3. Formyl at 5.

4. Hydroxyl at 2.

5. Methoxy at 4.

Wait, no. Alphabetically, the substituents are:

- 3-cyano,

- 2-hydroxy,

- 4-methoxy,

-5-formyl,

-6-(dimethylamino).

Wait, but when listing them alphabetically, it's based on the substituent name, regardless of their position.

So the substituents in alphabetical order are:

1. 3-cyano.

2. 2-hydroxy.

3. 4-methoxy.

4. 5-formyl.

5. 6-(dimethylamino).

Wait, but substituent names are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

So the order is:

Cyano comes first.

Then comes dimethylamino.

Wait, wait, no. Alphabetically:

C (cyano) comes before D (dimethylamino), which comes before F (formyl), then H (hydroxyl), then M (methoxy).

So the order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

So in the name, each substituent is mentioned in this order, each with their respective position numbers.

So the name starts with benzoic acid. Then, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each with their position.

But let's think about how the name is formed.

The base is benzoic acid. Then, the substituents are added as prefixes.

So the substituents are:

At position 2: hydroxyl.

At position 3: cyano.

At position 4: methoxy.

At position 5: formyl.

At position 6: dimethylamino.

But when listing them in alphabetical order, the order is cyano (3), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxyl (2), methoxy (4).

Wait, but the substituent order in the name is alphabetical, not based on position.

Wait, no, the substituent order in the IUPAC name is determined by the alphabetical order of their substituent names. So first comes cyano, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

But each substituent is preceded by its position number. So the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, let me check the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That matches our conclusion.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, the order here is hydroxy first, then cyano, which is incorrect because 'cyano' comes before 'hydroxyl' alphabetically.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid. No, because dimethylamino comes earlier alphabetically than formyl, which it doesn't in alphabetical order.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. No, because cyano is at 5, which doesn't fit our substituent positions.

So the correct name is option A.


The molecule is a benzene ring with multiple substituents arranged as follows:

1. **Principal functional group**: The carboxylic acid (COOH) is at position 1, as it is the principal functional group and must have the lowest possible number.

2. **Substituents ortho to COOH**: 
   - At position 2: Hydroxyl (OH).
   - At position 6: Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂).

3. **Substituent para to COOH**: At position 4: Methoxy (OCH₃).

4. **Other substituents**: 
   - Cyanide (CN) at position 3.
   - Formyl (CHO) at position 5.

The arrangement satisfies the conditions:
- The carboxylic acid, cyanide, and formyl are all meta to each other.
- The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the cyanide.

### IUPAC Naming:
The substituents are listed in alphabetical order of their names, regardless of their positions:
1. **Cyano (CN)** at position 3.
2. **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)** at position 6.
3. **Formyl (CHO)** at position 5.
4. **Hydroxyl (OH)** at position 2.
5. **Methoxy (OCH₃)** at position 4.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: Correct. Matches the derived name.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Substituents are listed out of alphabetical order.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Substituents are listed out of alphabetical order and positions are mismatched.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Cyanide is incorrectly placed at position 5.
