Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about excitation in stars, it's related to the temperature. Both stars are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I think that means the Saha equation applies. Wait, the Saha equation deals with ionization, but maybe this is about the Boltzmann distribution for energy levels?

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the ratio of excited states between the two stars is 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

Right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The number of atoms in a particular energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

So the ratio of the populations (n1/n2) is equal to the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two stars. So for star_1 and star_2, the ratio would be [exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))].

Alternatively, I think the ratio could also be written as exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ), because when you divide the exponents, you subtract the exponents. Let me double-check that. 

Wait, wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ), but since we're considering the same energy levels, the statistical weights (g) might be the same for both stars, so they cancel out. So the ratio is exp(ΔE/(k T) ), but wait no, I think the formula is exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), so if the energy level is higher, the exponent is negative, so the higher the temperature, the more population in higher energy levels.

Wait, the problem states that the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 n2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

So,

2 = [ (g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (g2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) ]

Assuming g1 = g2 (same element, same transition), then the g's cancel, leaving:

2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Hmm, let me rearrange that. Let me factor out the 1/(ΔE/k):

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, let me see: 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Oh right, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting that in:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. Let me recall the value of the Boltzmann constant k. I think k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's exactly the same number as the given ΔE. Interesting.

So if ΔE = k * some value, maybe that simplifies things. Let me plug in the numbers. Let me check: k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k * (something). Let me compute that. ΔE = k * (something) → (something) = ΔE /k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches. Option C has (T1 - T2) over (T1 T2)^2, which doesn't fit. So the correct equation should be ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The problem says star_1 is more excited, so T1 > T2. So the numerator (T1 - T2) is positive, and (T1 T2) is positive, so ln(2) is positive. Which makes sense.

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the correct option is D.

The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is approximately 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The ratio of the populations of atoms in a specific energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the temperatures of star_1 and star_2, respectively. Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2 (\( n_1/n_2 = 2 \)), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K, which matches the given \( \Delta E \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the derived relationship. For example:

- Option A (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \)) does not involve the correct ratio of temperatures.
- Option B (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \)) incorrectly adds the temperatures.
- Option C (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \)) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
