Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that's the state vector, probably a 3x1 column vector. So the state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, do I need to normalize this vector first? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their norm is 1. Let me check that.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So to make it a valid quantum state, I should probably normalize it. So the normalized state would be 1/sqrt(6) times the vector. But wait, in the problem, when measuring the observable, does the state need to be normalized? Because the observable's eigenvalues and eigenvectors might depend on that.

Wait no, the observable is a matrix operator, and the state is given. So for the probability calculation, I think we just calculate the expectation, but wait, no. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components of the state in the corresponding eigenvectors.

But first, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P is:

[ 0          1/sqrt(2)   0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)   0           1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0          1/sqrt(2)   0        ]

I need to find the probability of measuring 0 when P is measured. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P, and 0 must be one of them. So I should find the eigenvalues of P and then determine if 0 is an eigenvalue, and then find the corresponding eigenvectors. Then compute the probability.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the expectation value, but that's for the average. Wait no, the question is about the probability of getting 0, not the expectation.

So let's tackle finding the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So compute the determinant of:

[ -λ   1/sqrt(2)    0   ]
[1/sqrt(2)  -λ    1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0    1/sqrt(2)   -λ ]

Hmm, the determinant of a 3x3 can be a bit involved. Let me expand along the first row.

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ] ] ) - (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * ... 

So the first term is -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

The second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) times the determinant, which is [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -λ / sqrt(2) ) )? Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the minor for the element (1,2), which is 1/sqrt(2), is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So that would be:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So the minor is:
[1/sqrt(2)   1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0           -λ      ]

Wait no, wait, the minor for (1,2) is the determinant of the submatrix when you remove row 1 and column 2.

Original matrix after removing row 1, column 2:
Row 2 becomes [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] but column 2 is removed, so it's [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], column 2 removed is [0, 0].

Wait I think I'm getting confused. Let me write the submatrix for the minor of element (1,2):

Rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So for row 2, columns 1 and 3: 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3, columns 1 and 3: 0, 0.

So the minor matrix is:

[1/sqrt(2)   1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0           0       ]

The determinant is (1/sqrt(2)*0) - (1/sqrt(2)*0) ) = 0.

So the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0.

The third term is 0, so it doesn't contribute.

So the determinant is -λ [ λ² - 1/2 ].

Set this equal to zero: -λ (λ² - 1/2 ) = 0

So the solutions are λ = 0, and λ² = 1/2 → λ= ±1/√2.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1/sqrt(2), and -1/sqrt(2).

So, 0 is an eigenvalue, which is what we're interested in.

Now, the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. Let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 +0*v3 =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 +0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → v1 + v3 =0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 +0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero.

From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T, where v1 = -v3. Let me parameterize this. Let's set v3 = t, then v1 = -t. So the eigenvectors are t*(-1, 0, 1).

Wait, because v1 = -v3, so if I set v3 = t, then v1 = -t. So the vector is (-t, 0, t) = t*(-1,0,1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (-1,0,1).

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, looking back at the equations:

We have v2=0.

And v1 + v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1,0,v3) = ( -v3, 0, v3 ) = v3*(-1,0,1). So yes, that's correct. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (-1,0,1), but normalized.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional with eigenvector proportional to (-1,0,1).

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, earlier I thought it's not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But when calculating probabilities, the absolute square of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector gives the probability.

Wait wait, no. The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to 0.

But since the eigenvector is (-1,0,1), let's call it |v>.

So the probability is |<v | ψ>|².

Wait, but wait, |v> is not normalized. Because for eigenvectors, we can choose any non-zero vector in the eigenspace. So to compute the inner product, I should normalize it first.

So the normalized eigenvector is |v> = 1/sqrt( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 ) * (-1,0,1) = 1/sqrt(2) * (-1,0,1).

So |v> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But wait, we should use the normalized state, right?

The normalized |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6) = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

Now, the inner product <v | ψ> is the dot product of v and ψ.

So compute:

( -1/sqrt(2) ) * ( -1/sqrt(6) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Simplify each term:

First term: (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = 1/(sqrt(12)) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Second term: 0.

Third term: (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = same as first term, 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

So sum is 1/(2√3) + 0 + 1/(2√3) = 2/(2√3) ) = 1/√3.

So the inner product is 1/√3.

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (1/√3 )² = 1/3.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is 1/3.

But wait, let me make sure. Did I do everything correctly?

Wait, another approach: the observable P is a matrix, and when we measure it, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The probabilities are the square of the projections of the state onto each eigenspace.

In this case, since the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional (dim=1), the projection is just the inner product with the normalized eigenvector.

So the steps are correct: normalize the eigenvector, compute the inner product, square it.

So yes, the probability is 1/3.

But wait, another way to check: perhaps the operator P is a projection operator? Because sometimes in quantum mechanics, P might be a projection operator, which would mean that it has eigenvalues 0 and 1. But looking at P's matrix, it doesn't look like a projection operator. Because a projection matrix should satisfy P^2 = P. Let me check:

Compute P^2.

First row of P: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

Multiply P by P.

Element (1,1): 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + 0*0 → (1/2) + 0 + 0 = 1/2.

Wait, but if P were a projection matrix, then the diagonal elements would be 1 for eigenvalue 1 and 0 for eigenvalue 0. But here, P^2 (1,1) is 1/2, which is not equal to P(1,1)=0. So P is not a projection operator. So the earlier approach is correct.

Thus, the correct answer should be 1/3, which is option C.

To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the eigenvalue \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right).
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = 0, \, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, \( 0 \) is an eigenvalue of \( P \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
To find the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \), we solve \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). This leads to the system of equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow v_2 = 0\),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow v_1 = -v_3\),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow v_2 = 0\).

Thus, the eigenvector is of the form \( |v\rangle = t(-1, 0, 1) \), where \( t \) is a scalar. Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Probability
The state of the system is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). First, we normalize \( |\psi\rangle \). The norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product \( \langle v | \psi \rangle \). Compute \( \langle v | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + (1)(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( 1 + 0 + 1 \right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
