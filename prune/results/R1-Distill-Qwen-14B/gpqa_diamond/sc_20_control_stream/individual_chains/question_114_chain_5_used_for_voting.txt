Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reagents are correct for the given reactions. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, what's the exact mechanism? Oh right, the ketone has a carbonyl group, which can undergo addition reactions. So NaCN provides the cyanide ion as a nucleophile.

Wait, but how does that lead to a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group? Oh, maybe it's a two-step process. So first, the cyanide adds to the ketone. I think the cyanide ion (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon in a nucleophilic addition. Then, perhaps after the addition, something else happens. Since the product has a hydroxyl group, maybe there's a work-up involved.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh! Maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, no. Let me think about the reagents. The first step involves NaCN and reagent A.

Wait, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps under acid conditions? Oh, I think that adding H3O+ (which is option A and B) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an addition product where the HCN adds to the carbonyl, giving a compound with an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the first reaction's product.

So the first step must be the formation of a cyanohydrin. To form a cyanohydrin from a ketone, you usually use an acid catalyst. So, the reagent A is H3O+ or maybe something else like H2SO4. Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+, and option C says NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: sometimes HCN is used with a weak acid or without. But in some cases, maybe a stronger acid like H2SO4 is used. Alternatively, maybe H3O+ is sufficient. So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (proton source), because the addition of HCN to ketones typically uses an acid catalyst.

So if I'm right, reagent A is H3O+. That narrows down the options to A, B, or D. Because option C has A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about.

Now the second reaction. The product from the first step is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but wait, no. Wait, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, that's a more complex molecule. But the reaction here is with reagent B (H2O) to form the corresponding acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile (since it's a nitrile) and a hydroxyl group. So when a nitrile is hydrolyzed, under certain conditions, it can form a carboxylic acid. But wait, the starting material here is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon? Or is it a secondary alcohol adjacent to the nitrile?

Wait, the product is a butanoic acid derivative, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) must have been converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So how do nitriles convert to carboxylic acids? Typically, hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. But for nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually have strong acidic conditions or basic conditions with heat, maybe.

Wait, but wait another point: the starting material is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, but what about the hydroxyl group? It remains as a hydroxyl group in the product, so maybe it's not undergoing any change.

Wait, but in the product, the position is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Oh, wait, the starting material has a nitrile group on carbon 2 and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid, so carbon 2 now has a -COOH and an -OH group. That's possible, but that's a geminal diol situation—wait, no, wait. Let me think about the structure.

The starting nitrile is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So structure-wise, the carbon chain is butane, with the second carbon (the middle one) having a hydroxyl group (OH), a nitrile group (CN), and two other substituents. Wait, but butane has four carbons. So 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, but in any case, when the nitrile group is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the product would have a COOH group on that carbon. So the starting material has a CN on C2 and OH on C2, but after hydrolysis, it becomes COOH on C2 and OH on C2?

Wait, that's a bit odd because having both -COOH and -OH on the same carbon is not very common. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group remains, but the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which suggests that the COOH is on C2 and the OH is on C2 as well. Hmm. Not sure if that's correct, but perhaps the problem is correct.

So the second reaction is hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. What reagents are used for that? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed using strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and heat, or using a strong base like aqueous KOH and heat, followed by acid work-up.

Wait, but in the options, reagent B is H2O. Hmm, perhaps it's the work-up conditions. Wait, no, the second reaction is "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". So reagent B is H2O, but perhaps with some other conditions.

Wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis using HCl or another acid. Another possibility is that the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic aqueous conditions. So for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you typically use a strong acid and heat. So perhaps the reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A for B is HCl, option C for B is HCl, option B has B as CH3COOH, and D has B as CH3COOH.

Wait, let me think again. The first reaction uses NaCN and reagent A. If A is H3O+, then it's an acid-catalyzed addition of HCN to the ketone. Then the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group on the same carbon.

Then, in the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. The conditions for that are usually strong acid and heat. So if reagent B is HCl, that would make sense because HCl is a strong acid.

Looking at the options, the only options where B is HCl are A and C. So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (options A and B), but in option A, B is HCl. So that would fit with the second reaction using HCl.

Wait, but wait, option C has A as NaHSO3. Do I need to consider that?

Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. What's that used for? I think it's used for the reduction of certain groups, like in the reduction of ketones to alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's used in the work-up of certain reactions.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A. If A is H3O+, then the reaction is acid-catalyzed HCN addition.

Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3 (option C), perhaps it's being used as a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker base than H3O+.

Wait, but for the formation of a cyanohydrin, I thought we needed an acid catalyst. So H3O+ would make sense, making the carbonyl more electrophilic.

So why would option C have NaHSO3 as A?

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of HCN, the NaHSO3 could act as a source of H+ or HSO3^- as a proton source.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to outline what each part of the reactions requires.

First reaction: ketone + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. So the conditions are likely acid-catalyzed. So A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Second reaction: nitrile + B (H2O) → carboxylic acid. So B is likely a strong acid, like HCl, which provides the acidic conditions for hydrolysis of the nitrile.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → fits.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → A might not be the right catalyst for the first reaction.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → unlikely, since B would need strong acid.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → B is a weaker acid, but maybe not strong enough.

So if I go with option A, the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, and the second uses HCl as the acid for hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait another point. The first reaction's product is a cyanohydrin, which involves the addition of HCN. So the reaction is:

R2CO + HCN → R2C(OH)CN

Which is typically done under acidic conditions. So A must be an acid.

Thus, in the options, A must be either H3O+ or another acid. So for option A, reagent A is H3O+.

So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but looking back at the second reaction, reagent B is H2O but the option says B is HCl. So in the reaction, H2O is present, but perhaps in acidic conditions. So maybe the reaction is done under HCl aqueous conditions.

I think the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) for each step.

### Reaction 1: Formation of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
The first reaction involves butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form a cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (option A) is the most suitable acid catalyst for this reaction.

### Reaction 2: Conversion of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Among the options, **HCl** (option A) is the most appropriate reagent for this step.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl):** This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the formation of the cyanohydrin, and HCl is suitable for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.
- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH):** While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.
- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl):** NaHSO₃ is not a suitable catalyst for the formation of the cyanohydrin, as it is not an acid catalyst for this type of reaction.
- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH):** Neither NaHSO₃ nor CH₃COOH is appropriate for the given reactions.

### Conclusion
The correct reagents for the two reactions are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.
