Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They orbit in a system with circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I don't know if that method affects the problem directly; maybe it's just background info.

The question gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. The ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. Wait, no, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and other factors like albedo. Oh right, albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so that's the same for each planet. That means the temperature ratio is due to their distances from the star.

Then, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, meaning Planet2 is a bit more massive than Planet1. Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet3 is less massive than Planet2. Wait, no, because the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35. So if Planet2 is 1.35 times more massive than Planet3, then Planet3's mass is lower. Hmm.

But the question is about the orbital periods. It asks by what factor is Planet3's orbital period larger than Planet1's. So, I need to find P3/P1.

I remember that for planets orbiting the same star, the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis (which is the radius for circular orbits) and the mass of the star. Wait, but I don't have the mass of the star. Oh, but since all three planets are orbiting the same star, the star's mass is the same for all. So Kepler's third law applies here: P² is proportional to a³/(M_star + planet_mass). But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, we can approximate M_star + planet_mass ≈ M_star. So, P² ∝ a³.

But wait, no, actually, Kepler's law is more precise. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. So for all three planets, M is the same, so P² is proportional to a³.

So, if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a3/a1), then I can find the ratio of the periods (P3/P1) as (a3/a1)^(3/2).

But wait, how do I find a3/a1? Because the question gives temperature ratios. Equilibrium temperature is given by the formula: T = [ (L*(1 - A) ) / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the semi-major axis.

Since all planets have the same albedo (A=0.3), and same star (so same L), the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4) = (1/a²)^(1/4) * (L)^(1/4). Since L is the same for all, T ∝ 1/a^(1/2).

So, T = k / sqrt(a), where k is a constant. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T1 = k/sqrt(a1) and T2 = k/sqrt(a2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Given that T1/T2 is approximately 1.4. So sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 * a1.

Similarly, the ratio of T2 to T3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Because T2 = k/sqrt(a2) and T3 = k/sqrt(a3), so T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Therefore, sqrt(a3/a2) = T2/T3 = 2.3. So a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.

So, a3 = 5.29 * a2. But since a2 is 1.96 * a1, a3 =5.29 *1.96 *a1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96.

Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 *1.96 is approximately 0.5684. So total is roughly 10.3684. So a3 = approximately 10.3684 a1.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 5.29 *1.96:

1.96 is 200-4, so 5.29 * 200 = 1058, 5.29 *4 = 21.16. So 5.29 *1.96 = 5.29*(2 -0.04) ) = 5.29*2 -5.29*0.04 = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So yes, a3 is approximately 10.3684 times a1.

So the ratio of a3 to a1 is about 10.3684. Now, the period P is related to a by P² proportional to a³. Therefore, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

So (10.3684)^(3/2). Let me compute that. 10.3684 to the power 1.5.

First, sqrt(10.3684) is approximately 3.22 because 3.22^2 is 10.3684. Wait, wait, no, wait: Wait, 3.2^2 is 10.24, 3.22^2 is 3.22 *3.22 = let's see: 3*3=9, 3*0.22=0.66, 0.22*3=0.66, 0.22*0.22=0.0484. So (3+0.22)^2 = 9 + 2*(3*0.22) + (0.22)^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484= 10.3684. So yes, sqrt(10.3684) is exactly 3.22.

So, 10.3684^(3/2) = [sqrt(10.3684)]^3 = (3.22)^3.

Let me compute 3.22 cubed. 3^3 is 27, 0.22^3 is about 0.0106, but that's not helpful. Let's compute it step by step.

3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684 as before. Then, 10.3684 *3.22.

Hmm, 10 *3.22 =32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 is about 1.186.

So 32.2 +1.186 = about 33.386. So 3.22^3 ≈33.386.

Wait, but wait, 3.22 is the square root of 10.3684, so 3.22^3 is (sqrt(10.3684))^3 =10.3684^(3/2) = P3/P1.

So P3/P1 ≈33.386.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So 33.386 is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have missed something.

Wait, the mass ratios given: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet2 is 1.15 times Planet1's mass. Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet3 is 1/1.35 times Planet2's mass, which is 0.7407 times Planet2's. So Planet3's mass is 0.7407 * Planet2, which is 0.7407 *1.15 Planet1's mass, so about 0.852 Planet1's mass.

But wait, in Kepler's law, the period depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Oh wait, the formula for Kepler's third law when the planet's mass isn't negligible is more complicated, but in reality, for exoplanets, the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, so the planet's mass can be neglected. So the mass ratios between the planets shouldn't affect the orbital periods because the star's mass is what dominates.

So yeah, the mass ratios are given but perhaps are a red herring for this question. The problem only asks about the periods, which depend on the semi-major axes, which we calculated based on the temperature ratios.

So, the conclusion is that the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. So option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships provided in the question and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). Since the albedo and the star's luminosity are the same for all planets, the temperature ratio between two planets is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

From the given data:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \(T_1/T_2 = 1.4\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
  \]
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is \(T_2/T_3 = 2.3\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
  \]

Combining these results, the ratio of the semi-major axes between Planet3 and Planet1 is:

\[
\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.3684
\]

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \(\frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684\):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \(\sqrt{10.3684}\), which is approximately \(3.22\). Then:

\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = (3.22)^3
\]

Calculating \((3.22)^3\):

\[
3.22^3 = 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 = 33.386
\]

Thus, \(\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.386\), which is approximately \(33.4\). Comparing this result with the options provided:

- A) ~10.4
- B) ~3.2
- C) ~4.4
- D) ~33.4

The closest match is **D) ~33.4**.

So, if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a3/a1), then I can find the ratio of the periods (P3/P1) as (a3/a1)^(3/2).

But wait, how do I find a3/a1? Because the question gives temperature ratios. Equilibrium temperature is given by the formula: T = [ (L*(1 - A) ) / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the semi-major axis.

So, T = k / sqrt(a), where k is a constant. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T1 = k/sqrt(a1) and T2 = k/sqrt(a2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Given that T1/T2 is approximately 1.4. So sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 * a1.

Similarly, the ratio of T2 to T3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Because T2 = k/sqrt(a2) and T3 = k/sqrt(a3), so T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Therefore, sqrt(a3/a2) = T2/T3 = 2.3. So a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.

So, a3 = 5.29 * a2. But since a2 is 1.96 * a1, a3 =5.29 *1.96 *a1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96.

Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 *1.96 is approximately 0.5684. So total is roughly 10.3684. So a3 = approximately 10.3684 a1.

1.96 is 200-4, so 5.29 * 200 = 1058, 5.29 *4 = 21.16. So 5.29 *1.96 = 5.29*(2 -0.04) ) = 5.29*2 -5.29*0.04 = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So yes, a3 is approximately 10.3684 times a1.

So the ratio of a3 to a1 is about 10.3684. Now, the period P is related to a by P² proportional to a³. Therefore, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

So (10.3684)^(3/2). Let me compute that. 10.3684 to the power 1.5.

Wait, but wait, 3.22 is the square root of 10.3684, so 3.22^3 is (sqrt(10.3684))^3 =10.3684^(3/2) = P3/P1.

So P3/P1 ≈33.386.

From the given data:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \(T_1/T_2 = 1.4\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
  \]
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is \(T_2/T_3 = 2.3\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
  \]

Combining these results, the ratio of the semi-major axes between Planet3 and Planet1 is:

\[
\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.3684

Calculating \((3.22)^3\):

\[
3.22^3 = 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 = 33.386
