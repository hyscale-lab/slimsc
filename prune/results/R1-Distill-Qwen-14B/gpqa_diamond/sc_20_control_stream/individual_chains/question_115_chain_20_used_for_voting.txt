Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on.

So, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis but in opposite directions. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is coming from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but their directions are such that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, their annihilation should conserve both energy and momentum. Also, since they have opposite momenta, the total momentum before annihilation should be zero. Wait, wait—no, wait. Because they are moving towards each other, their momenta would be in opposite directions. So I should compute their individual momenta and see if their sum is zero.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma. So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron, it's 2. But wait, a positron has the same mass as an electron, right? So their rest masses are the same, m_e.

The momentum of each particle would be gamma * m_e * v. But since I'm working in natural units, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of gamma and m_e.

Alternatively, I can use the relativistic momentum formula p = gamma * m_e * v. But since v is in terms of c, perhaps I can express it as p = gamma * m_e * beta * c. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Wait, but since both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, their momenta are along that axis. So the total initial momentum should be the sum of their momenta. Let me calculate each momentum.

For the electron moving from the left (let's say positive x-direction), its velocity is v_e = beta_e * c. The Lorentz factor gamma_e is 4. So its momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e. Similarly, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction. Its gamma_p is 2, so its momentum p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p. But since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum would be negative if we take the positive x as the direction of the electron.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me get the signs straight. Let me assume the electron is moving to the right (positive x) with gamma 4, and the positron is moving to the left (negative x) with gamma 2. So their velocities are positive and negative, respectively.

Wait, no. The problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So its direction is to the left, since it's moving towards the electron. So its velocity is negative along the x-axis.

So the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p in the negative x direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative of gamma_p m_e beta_p).

Wait, but to calculate the actual momenta, I need to find beta for each. Because beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So for each particle:

For the electron, gamma_e =4. So gamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e^2) → beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e^2) → sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4. So beta_e is sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p =2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

Now, their momenta are p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) = m_e * sqrt(15). Wait, because 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) is just sqrt(15). So p_e = m_e * sqrt(15) in the positive x direction.

The positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) )= m_e * sqrt(3). But since it's moving in the negative x direction, this momentum would be - m_e * sqrt(3).

So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e (sqrt(15) ) + ( - m_e sqrt(3) ) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait. Wait, since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative, so p_p is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = (m_e sqrt(15)) - (m_e sqrt(3)).

Wait, but if the system's initial momentum isn't zero, then the photons must carry away momentum in such a way that the total momentum is conserved. So in this case, the initial momentum is not zero, so the photons' momenta must add up to that.

Wait a minute. I thought when particles annihilate, the total momentum would be zero, but now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in the problem, the electron is moving from the left, the positron from the right. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions. So if the electron's momentum is larger than the positron's, the total momentum would not be zero. So when they annihilate, the photons must carry away momentum that adds up to that initial value.

But in the problem, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So they are both moving to the right? Or one to the right and one to the left? Wait, the problem says one is upper-right, another lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction but at different angles above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but then their momenta in the x-direction would add, so how would that conserve the initial momentum? Because the initial momentum is positive (electron's momentum is larger than the positron's), so the total is positive.

Alternatively, maybe the photons are moving in opposite directions, but that's not what the question says. The question says one is upper-right, another lower-right.

Hmm. So each photon has momentum vectors. The sum of the two photons' momenta should equal the initial momentum of the system, which is m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, so let's model this. Let the photons have energy E each, so their momentum magnitudes are E/c each. Wait, but since c is 1 in natural units (like in particle physics), their momentum is equal to their energy. But I'll have to account for direction with angles.

I'll let the first photon have an angle theta above the x-axis, and the second photon have an angle theta' below the x-axis. But the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both are moving towards the right (positive x) but in opposite vertical directions.

Wait, but wait. If both photons are moving to the right, their x-components of momentum would add, but their y-components would be opposite. So the total y-momentum would be zero, which would match the initial y-momentum (which is zero, since both particles are moving along x).

But wait, the initial system's total momentum is in the x-direction only, right? Because both particles are moving along x, so their momenta are along x. So the initial momentum is in the x-direction, and the photons' momenta must add up to this.

So each photon's momentum has components:

Photon 1: (E cos(theta), E sin(theta))
Photon 2: (E cos(theta'), E sin(theta'))

Wait, but wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy, E. So their momenta are E in magnitude, but directions depend on their angles.

The sum of the two photons' momenta should equal the initial momentum of the system, which is p_initial = m_e (sqrt(15)−sqrt(3)).

So the sum in the x-direction is E (cos(theta) + cos(theta')) = p_initial.

And the sum in the y-direction is E (sin(theta) + sin(theta')) = 0.

But since the problem says that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, their theta and theta' would be angles in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. So if theta is the angle above the x-axis, theta' would be the angle below, but perhaps symmetric in some way.

Wait, but the sum of the y-components must be zero. So E (sin(theta) + sin(theta')) = 0. Since E is positive, this implies that sin(theta) = - sin(theta'). Which means that theta' = - theta. So the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

So if photon 1 is at angle theta above the x-axis, photon 2 is at angle theta below, but wait, no—if theta' is negative, then the angles would be symmetric.

Wait, but in the problem, both photons are moving towards the right, so their angles are measured from the x-axis towards the upper and lower directions. So photon 1's angle is theta above x-axis, photon 2's is theta' below, which I'll take as -theta.

Wait no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps photon 2 is at angle phi below the x-axis, which would be a negative angle. But their sines would be + and -, respectively.

Wait, but considering that the sum is zero, sin(theta) + sin(theta') = 0 → sin(theta') = - sin(theta). So theta' could be -theta, but then the angles would be symmetric about the x-axis. So if one photon is at angle theta, the other would be at angle -theta.

But wait, let me get this straight. If the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles are theta and (360 - theta) if they're in opposite quadrants. But in terms of the x-axis, maybe they're in the first and fourth quadrants. So their angles would add in a way that sin(theta) = - sin(theta').

So, given that, the sum would be zero.

So the x-component equation is E [cos(theta) + cos(theta') ] = p_initial.

But since theta' = -theta for the y-components to cancel, what about the x-components?

Wait, cos(theta') = cos(-theta) = cos(theta). So the x-component of each photon is E cos(theta). So the sum is E * [cos(theta) + cos(theta)] = 2 E cos(theta) = p_initial.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the sum of the x-components is 2 E cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, the problem also states that both photons have the same energy, so E is the same for both. So 2 E cos(theta) is the sum of the x-components.

But what about the y-components? They add up to zero, as we saw earlier.

So, to find the angle between the two photons, let me think. If each photon has an angle theta above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, that makes sense. Because one is at theta above x, the other at theta below, so the angle between them is 2 theta.

So if I can find theta, I can compute the angle between the photons as 2 theta.

So let's set up the equations.

We have:

2 E cos(theta) = p_initial = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

And:

E (sin(theta) - sin(theta)) = 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-express.

Wait, the second equation was sin(theta) + sin(theta') = 0. But if theta' is the angle of the second photon, which is below the x-axis, then sin(theta') = - sin(theta). So sin(theta) + (- sin(theta)) = 0. Which is correct.

But perhaps I can express the total momentum in terms of E and theta.

So the sum of the x-components is 2 E cos(theta) = p_initial.

Now, the energy of each photon is E. But the total energy of the system after annihilation must equal the total energy before annihilation.

The initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

The energy of each particle is gamma * m_e c^2. Since in natural units, c=1, so energy E_e = gamma_e m_e, E_p = gamma_p m_e.

So E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e = (4 + 2) m_e = 6 m_e.

The photons have energies E each, so E_total = 2 E.

Thus, 2 E = 6 m_e → E = 3 m_e.

Wait, that's a key point. So E_photon = 3 m_e.

So substituting E = 3 m_e into the x-component equation:

2 * (3 m_e) * cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

6 m_e cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

We can cancel m_e from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Hmm. Let's compute that.

Compute numerator: sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.3568.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568 → theta ≈ arccos(0.3568).

Calculating that: arccos(0.3568) is approx 69 degrees.

Wait, wait, let me get more precise. Let me compute the exact value without approximating.

Wait, perhaps I can rationalize the expression. Let me see:

sqrt(15) = sqrt(3 *5) = sqrt(3) * sqrt(5).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me compute the exact value numerically.

Compute the numerator: sqrt(15)=3.872983346, sqrt(3)=1.732050808.

So 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 = 2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 = 0.3568220897.

So cos(theta) = 0.356822.

What's arccos(0.3568)?

Well, I know that cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(70 degrees) is about 0.3420, which is lower than 0.3568. So 70 degrees is about 0.3420, which is less than 0.3568, so theta is a bit less than 70 degrees.

Wait, wait, actually, wait. Because as the angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees, cosine decreases. So 0.3568 is between cos(69) and cos(70).

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

cos(69°)= approx 0.3584.

cos(69°) → about 0.3584.

cos(69.5°) → let me compute using a calculator.

Wait, maybe I'll use a calculator to find theta.

Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.3568 is less than 0.3584 (which is 69 degrees), so theta is a bit more than 69 degrees. Wait, no—wait, cos(69) is about 0.3584. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me check: cos(60°)=0.5, cos(65°)= approx 0.4226, cos(70°)= approx 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between cos(69°) and cos(70°).

Wait, cos(69°)= approx 0.3584.

So 0.3568 is slightly less than 0.3584, so theta is just a bit more than 69 degrees, say 69.2 degrees.

But perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me think.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with the exact expression. So theta = arccos( [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]/(6) ).

Once I find theta, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta. So what is 2 theta?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle between the two photons using the dot product formula. Let me think.

Each photon's direction can be represented as a unit vector. Photon 1: (cos(theta), sin(theta)), Photon 2: (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

The angle phi between them can be found using the dot product:

cos(phi) = (cos(theta) * cos(theta) + sin(theta) * (-sin(theta)) ) / ( |v1| |v2| )

Since both are unit vectors, |v1| = |v2|=1.

So cos(phi) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So phi = 2 theta.

Ah, so the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.

So once I find theta, I can double it to get the angle between them.

So with theta ≈69 degrees, the angle between them would be about 138 degrees. Which is option C.

Wait, the options are:

A) 74

B) 172

C) 138

D)96

Wait, option C is 138 degrees, which is exactly 2 times 69 degrees. So that would be the case.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, wait, what about the initial momentum calculation?

Earlier, I calculated p_initial = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but that's because the electron is moving right with p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) = m_e sqrt(15).

The positron is moving left, so its momentum is -gamma_p m_e beta_p = -2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 )= - m_e sqrt(3).

So total p_initial = m_e sqrt(15) - m_e sqrt(3) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So that's correct.

And the total energy is 6 m_e, so each photon has E = 3 m_e.

Then, 2 E cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Substituting E = 3 m_e:

2 * 3 m_e * cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) → 6 m_e cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e → 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Yes, correct. So cos(theta) = [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]/(6).

So that gives theta ≈69 degrees, so the angle between photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which would be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons with equal energy but different directions. The goal is to determine the angle between the two photons.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$, and its momentum is $p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e = 4 m_e \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e \sqrt{15}$.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_p = 2$, and its momentum is $p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p = 2 m_e \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e \sqrt{3}$.
   - The total initial momentum is $p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})$.

2. **Energy Conservation**:
   - The total energy of the system before annihilation is $E_{\text{initial}} = (\gamma_e + \gamma_p) m_e = (4 + 2) m_e = 6 m_e$.
   - After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons, so each photon has energy $E = \frac{6 m_e}{2} = 3 m_e$.

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon has momentum $p = \frac{E}{c}$, and in natural units ($c = 1$), $p = E = 3 m_e$.
   - Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be $\theta$ and $-\theta$, respectively. Their momentum components are:
     - Photon 1: $(3 m_e \cos\theta, 3 m_e \sin\theta)$.
     - Photon 2: $(3 m_e \cos\theta, -3 m_e \sin\theta)$.

4. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - In the x-direction: $3 m_e \cos\theta + 3 m_e \cos\theta = 6 m_e \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})$.
     Solving for $\cos\theta$:  
     $$\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3568.$$
   - In the y-direction: $3 m_e \sin\theta - 3 m_e \sin\theta = 0$, which is satisfied.

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The angle between the two photons is $2\theta$. Using $\cos\theta \approx 0.3568$, we find $\theta \approx 69^\circ$.
   - Thus, the angle between the photons is $2\theta \approx 138^\circ$.

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
