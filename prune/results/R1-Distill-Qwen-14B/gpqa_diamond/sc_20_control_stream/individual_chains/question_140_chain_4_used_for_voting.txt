Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's a noble gas because noble gases have atoms with complete valence shells, often making them monatomic. But wait, the question says a molecule, so maybe it's O2 or another diatomic gas? But O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in each molecule (since each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so two atoms would make 16 each). So the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons, which fits the condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a triatomic or something else, but O2 seems likely.

Then, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. Let me think, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium chloride? Because I remember that NH4Cl has a melting point around there. Wait, but when you heat NH4Cl, it decomposes into NH3 and HCl gas. So if G is NH4Cl, and upon heating, it releases B, which could be either NH3 or HCl. But wait, the melting point of B is given. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound.

Wait, the reaction produces a precipitate G. Let's think about what could react to form a precipitate. Liquid Y reacting with X—maybe Y is water, and X is a metal? Or perhaps a carbonate or something else.

But wait, the gas W is produced. If X is a metal reacting with an acid (maybe Y is an acid), then gas W could be H2. Let's see, H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each H is 1 proton, but if it's a heavier isotope, like D, then maybe a molecule of H2 would have 2 H and 2 D, but that's probably more complicated). Alternatively, if W is CO2, but wait, CO2 has 12 protons (from C) and 16 neutrons (8 in each O, so 16 total). No, that doesn't match same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same per molecule. So for CO2, the molecule would have 12 protons (from C) and 2*8=16 neutrons from O. Wait, that gives 12 protons and 16 neutrons; not the same. So that doesn't fit. So maybe W is something like O2, which has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Because each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 would have 16 each. Oh, wait, but O2 is diatomic, so each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits the condition! So W is O2.

But wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule, so the molecule has 2 atoms. So each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So total protons per molecule: 16. Neutrons per molecule: 16. So yes, same number. So W is O2.

So when X reacts with Y, it produces O2 gas, a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Wait, another thought: maybe B is water? No, water's melting point is 273 K. Oh, wait, the question says B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is 4°C. So like 4°C is the melting point of B. Hmm, what compounds have that? Maybe sodium hydroxide? No, that's way higher. Calcium carbonate? No, higher. Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 169°C. No, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate or something else.

Wait, perhaps B is something that when heated from G, which is a precipitate. Let's think about the precipitate. If X is sodium metal, for example, reacting with water (Y is H2O), the reaction would produce NaOH and H2 gas, but that's not O2. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate reacting with an acid. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But earlier I thought W is O2. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait another angle. The problem says that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. For example, if X is a chloride salt, maybe NaCl, but if one of the elements is a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37, but wait, substance X is incorporating a heavier isotope, so maybe one of the elements is something like chlorine, which has a heavier isotope. Or perhaps X is something like NH4Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. Wait, but if X is an ammonium chloride, and it reacts with something else.

Wait, let me think about the other part: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid (like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH) reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, what reaction could that be? Maybe esterification? But wait, esterification would involve an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps it's a neutralization with a base, but that would produce a salt and water. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is undergoing some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. If X is a metal and the keto acid is reacting with it, maybe it's a neutralization reaction, but that would produce a salt and water. But the product would then have O from the acid. Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaOH, but that's a base, not a metal. Wait, but if X is a metal, like sodium, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce sodium acetate, which has O atoms. Let me see: sodium acetate is CH3COONa. That has three O atoms in the acetate ion. Hmm, not two. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or some other reaction. Wait, another thought: the product has two O atoms. Maybe the keto acid loses some O when reacting with X. Like, if X is a strong reducing agent, it might reduce the keto acid. For example, if X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is a reducing agent. Then, if a keto acid (like a ketone) reacts with NaBH4, it would be reduced to an alcohol. But wait, the product would then have the same number of O, perhaps. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is something like a chlorinating agent. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize what I know so far.

1. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce O2 gas, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it gives B which has a melting point of ~4°C.

2. The product of X reacting with a keto acid has a product with 2 O atoms.

3. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Hmm, reagent in organic chemistry—maybe something like NaOH (used in saponification), or KMnO4 (for oxidations), or maybe something else.

Wait, the gas W is O2. So the reaction between X and Y produces O2. Which reactions produce O2? Decomposition reactions, like 2KClO3 → 2KCl + 3O2, but that's with heat. Alternatively, electrolysis of water produces O2. But if Y is water, then perhaps X is an oxidizing agent that causes water to decompose. Alternatively, if X is a metal that reacts with water, but most metals produce H2, not O2. Wait, except perhaps sodium or potassium, which react violently with water, but that produces H2, not O2.

Wait, another possibility: X could be a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to produce O2. The reaction is: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2. So that would fit. So in this case, X is Na2O2, Y is water (H2O), W is O2.

Then, precipitate G would be NaOH, but wait, NaOH is soluble in water, so that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with another liquid. Hmm, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that when reacts with X produces a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Wait, maybe Y is an acid. If X is a carbonate, reacting with an acid would produce CO2, but earlier analysis suggested W is O2, which conflicts. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a salt that provides the necessary ions for the reaction. Let me think again about the precipitate G. If X is sodium peroxide and Y is water, the reaction produces NaOH, which is a strong base. But NaOH is soluble, so that wouldn't form a precipitate. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe Y isn't water. Let's think about other liquids. For example, if Y is an alcohol, perhaps ethanol. But then, what reaction would produce O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between X and a solution of a salt that, when reacted, produces a precipitate. For example, if X is sodium sulfite, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce SO2 gas, but that's not O2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the precipitate G. When X and Y react, G is formed, which upon heating gives B with a melting point close to 277 K. Let's say G is something that decomposes upon heating. If G is a carbonate, like NaHCO3, and heating it gives Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But what's the melting point of Na2CO3? I think it's around 850°C, which isn't close to 4°C. Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate. Heating sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) gives Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The melting point of B (if it's Na2CO3) is higher than 4°C. Alternatively, maybe G is something else, like ammonium chloride. Heating NH4Cl gives NH3 and HCl gas. But the melting point of NH4Cl is around 150°C, I think. Hmm, but the problem states that B's melting point is around 277 K (4°C).

Wait, maybe B is water ice. Because at 277 K, it's 4°C, which is just above the melting point of ice. So perhaps when G is heated, it releases B, which is water. But what would G be? If G is something that, when heated, releases water. For example, maybe a hydrate. If G is a hydrated salt, like Na2SO4·10H2O, upon heating it loses water. But then, W would be H2O vapor, but the problem says W is a gas with equal protons and neutrons, which would be O2 as previously thought.

Wait, but if G is a carbonate, like sodium carbonate decahydrate, heating it would produce anhydrous sodium carbonate and water vapor. But then W would be H2O, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons per molecule (since each O has 8, H has 1). So H2O has 2 H (each with 1p, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So total protons in H2O: 2 + 8 =10? No, wait. Each H has 1 proton, each O has 8. So H2O has 2 H (each 1p) and 1 O (8p), so total protons: 10. Neutrons: O has 8, H has 0 each. So 8. 10 vs 8, which doesn't match. So W can't be H2O. So W must be O2, which has 16 protons and 16 neutrons, which fits.

So let's go back. W is O2. So the reaction between X and Y produces O2. If Y is water, and X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, which reacts with water to produce O2. So the reaction is:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

In this case, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble, so that can't be. So perhaps Y isn't water. Alternatively, maybe Y is another solution. Wait, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. But then, the reaction would produce CO2, not O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal peroxide, like BaO2, which reacts with water to produce O2. Let me think about the reaction: 2 BaO2 + 2 H2O → 2 Ba(OH)2 + O2↑. So in this case, Y is water, X is BaO2. The precipitate G would be Ba(OH)2, which is soluble in water. Hmm, no precipitate. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the reaction is with a solution of a salt that, when reacted with X, produces a precipitate. For example, maybe X is Na2O2, and Y is a solution of a nitrate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not water but another liquid, like a solution of a salt. Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, and X is Na2SO4. But then, the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and NaNO3. But that doesn't produce O2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid. The product has 2 O atoms. Suppose the product is an ester. Wait, no, esters have more O. Maybe it's an ether? No, ethers have two C-O bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketal or something else.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's say X is a dehydrating agent. For example, PCl5 is used to dehydrate carboxylic acids to anhydrides. Alternatively, if X is a metal like Mg, which can reduce a ketone to an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the O count.

Wait, perhaps X is a chlorinating agent. For example, SOCl2 is used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides. The reaction is: RCOOH + SOCl2 → RCOCl + SO2↑ + HCl↑. But in this case, the product RCOCl has more O (one O in COCl, but I'm not sure if that's relevant).

Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaOH, which can react with a keto acid in a neutralization reaction. For example, a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacting with NaOH would produce sodium acetate, water, and maybe release CO2 if it's a carbonate. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce O2, G, and B. Let's think about what X could be. If X is a peroxide (like Na2O2), then when it reacts with an acid (like H2SO4), it can produce O2. The reaction is: Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + O2↑. So in this case, Y would be H2SO4, which is a liquid. The precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble in water, so that's not a precipitate. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an alcohol, like ethanol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that when reacts with X produces a precipitate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl solution, they react to form AgCl precipitate. But that reaction doesn't produce O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a solution of a nitrate, leading to a displacement reaction that produces O2. For example, if X is sodium metal, and Y is a solution of Pb(NO3)2, but I don't think sodium would produce O2 in that reaction. Or maybe some other metal reacting with a nitrate solution to produce O2? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, but we thought W was O2 earlier. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to find X based on the other clues. The problem says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So what reagents are used in organic chemistry that fit this? Maybe something like NaOH (used in saponification), KMnO4 (for oxidation), or perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: X is used in the production of esters or in some condensation reactions. For example, PCl5 is used to make acid chlorides. Or maybe X is a catalyst, but the question says it's a substance that reacts.

Wait, the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps one of the elements in X has a higher mass isotope. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X contains Cl, it might have a heavier isotope. Or maybe X is something like CH3Cl, but that's not a usual reagent.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are given as 35, 25, 31, 29. Wait, wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all their isotopes. So for example, if X contains hydrogen and oxygen, the lightest is H (atomic mass 1), the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, but that's not an option. So perhaps X contains elements with higher masses.

Wait, let's think: the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These numbers are the sums of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So for example, if X contains Na (23) and O (16), sum is 39, which isn't an option. Alternatively, if X has Mg (24) and Cl (35.5), sum is 59.5, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe X contains the elements with atomic numbers such that their lightest and heaviest isotopes sum to one of the options. Let's see:

Option A: 35. Could be 17 (Cl) + 18 (Ar) = 35? No. Or perhaps 15 (P) + 20 (Ca) = 35? No, 15+20=35? 15+20=35? Wait, 15+20 is 35? No, 35 is 15+20? 15+20=35? Wait, 15 + 20 =35? 15+20=35? Let me do the math: 15+20=35, yes. So elements 15 (Phosphorus) and 20 (Calcium). Wait, no, because the sum would be their atomic masses (P is ~31, Ca is ~40), so 31+40=71, not 35. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains elements with lower masses. Let's see, option D is 29. That could be 12 (C) +17 (Cl) = 29. Well, 12+17=29. So if X has carbon and chlorine, the sum would be 12 + 35.5 (Cl's atomic mass) = 47.5, but the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all heavier and lighter isotopes. Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X", considering if there are multiple isotopes, sum all the heavier and lighter.

Wait, wait. The question says, "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Does it mean that for each element present, you sum all their isotopes, and then add the lightest and heaviest elements' sums together?

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest element in X and the heaviest element in X, each considering their isotopes.

Wait, let me read the question again: "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Hmm, so for X, identify the lightest element and the heaviest element. For each, sum all their isotopes' masses (so for hydrogen, sum all isotopes like H, D, T, etc., but in reality, it's negligible but maybe just take the most common). Then add those two sums together.

Wait, but that would require knowing which elements are in X. Let me think about possible X candidates.

Earlier, I thought X could be Na2O2, which has Na (23) and O (16). So lightest element is O, heaviest is Na. Summing their atomic masses: O's atomic mass is ~16, Na's is ~23. Sum is 39. But that's not an option. So that can't be right.

Another possibility: X is something like NH4Cl. So the elements are N, H, Cl. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (~35.5). Sum would be 1 +35.5 =36.5, which is close to option A (35), but not exactly.

Wait, the question says to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. So if X is NH4Cl, then the lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (~35.5). Sum is 36.5. Not matching any option exactly.

Another possibility: X is KClO3. Elements are K (~39), Cl (~35.5), O (~16). Lightest is O, heaviest is K. Sum is 16 +39=55. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the reaction with a keto acid. The product has 2 O atoms. Suppose the product is an ester. Wait, no, esters have more O. Alternatively, maybe a ketone is being reduced to an alcohol. Wait, but that would add H, not reduce O count.

Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid (like acetic acid) is reacting with X in a way that removes O, like dehydration. For example, forming an acid anhydride. Acetic anhydride has O in it, but perhaps the product has fewer O atoms than the acid. Wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH (2 O in the COOH group). If it loses an O, maybe it's converted into something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is esterification, where two acetic acid molecules lose water to form an ester and another molecule. Wait, the product would have more O. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product has 2 O atoms. So maybe the product is a compound with two O atoms. For example, CO2 has one O per molecule, but maybe two atoms in some other arrangement. Wait, maybe the product is something like a ketone? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ether or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between X and the keto acid forms an acetal, which has multiple O atoms. Wait, but that would have more O, not fewer.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a geminal dihalide, but that doesn't fit either.

I think I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to proceed with what I have.

Assuming X is Na2O2. So the elements are Na and O. Their atomic masses: Na is ~23, O is ~16. Sum is 39, not an option. So maybe X is something else.

Wait, maybe X is KMnO4. Then, the elements are K (~39), Mn (~55), O (~16). Lightest is O, heaviest is Mn. Sum is 16 +55=71, not an option.

Another thought: perhaps X is CaCl2. So elements are Ca (~40), Cl (~35.5), and O? No, CaCl2 doesn't have O. So lightest is Cl? No, Cl is heavier than Ca? No, Ca is ~40, Cl ~35.5. So lightest is Cl, heaviest is Ca. Sum 35.5 +40=75.5. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is CH3COOH. No, that's the keto acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH2Cl2. Then, elements are C, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5, close to option A (35).

Alternatively, maybe X is CH3Cl. Then, same sum of 1 +35.5=36.5.

Wait, but the problem says the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. If X is CH3Cl, and the keto acid is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), what reaction would they have? Maybe a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Cl2, but that's a gas, and the reaction with Y would produce HCl and O2? No, Cl2 + H2O doesn't produce O2.

Wait, another approach: the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Let's think of possible element pairs.

Option C is 31. What two elements add up to 31? For example, S (32) and O (16) would be 48. No. Maybe Mg (24) and O (16) sums to 40. No. Wait, 15 (P) +16 (O)=31. So elements P and O. So if X contains P and O, their sum is 15+16=31. But wait, the actual atomic masses are about 31 (P) and 16 (O), so sum is 47. But that's not matching the option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the lightest element is O (16), and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), sum 51.5. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the elements are C (12) and O (16), sum 28, which is close to option D (29). But 12 +16=28, not 29.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are N (14) and O (16), sum 30, close to option D (29). Not exact.

Wait, maybe the lightest is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), sum 36.5. Close to option A (35). So perhaps the correct sum is 36.5, but since the options don't have that, maybe the intended answer is 35.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NH4NO3. Then, elements are N, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

Wait, maybe X contains K (39) and O (16). Sum 55, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something with elements like Na (23) and O (16), sum 39, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible elements in X. The options suggest the sum is around 25-35. So the lightest and heaviest elements in X have atomic masses adding to one of these numbers.

Looking at the options, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al), but that's not a likely pairing. Alternatively, 15 (P) +10 (Ne), but that's not correct.

Wait, let's think about possible diatomic molecules. For example, if X is O2, but that doesn't fit the initial conditions.

Alternatively, X could be something like H2O2. Then, elements are H and O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. So maybe the product is a compound with two O atoms, like CO2. But how would that happen? If the keto acid loses some O, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the product is an acetal. For example, if X is a strong acid like H2SO4, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, then perhaps they form an acetal with two O atoms. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration of the keto acid. For example, a keto acid losing a water molecule to form an anhydride. But then the product would have more O, not fewer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has one O. But the product has two O atoms, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. For example, acetic acid reacting with ethanol to form ethyl acetate and water. Ethyl acetate has more O, but the product in that case would have more O, not fewer.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base like NaOH, which reacts with the keto acid to form a salt with O. But the product would have O from both the acid and the base.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's think about the possible answers and see which makes sense.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

If the sum is 35, possible elements could be Cl (35.5) and something else. But 35.5 plus anything else would be over. Alternatively, maybe it's S (32) and O (16), but that's 48.

Wait, 35 is close to Cl's atomic mass. So perhaps X contains Cl and another element with atomic mass around 0, which isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe X contains F (19) and O (16), sum 35. 19+16=35. So elements F and O.

So if X contains F and O, then the lightest is F? No, O is lighter than F. Wait, no, F has an atomic number of 9, O is 8, so O is lighter. So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is F (19). Sum 35. That would make option A correct.

But does X contain F and O? What substance contains both F and O and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry? One possibility is TFE (tetrafluoroethylene), but that's more of a polymer precursor. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NaF, but that would react with acids to produce H2.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like a fluoroalkane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a perfluorinated compound, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps X is a fluoride ion source, like KF. Then, when KF reacts with an acid, it produces HF gas. But earlier analysis suggested W is O2, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2O, but that doesn't fit the isotope part.

Wait, another idea: X is NaNO2, sodium nitrite. Then, the elements are Na (23), N (14), O (16). Lightest element is O, heaviest is Na. Sum 16+23=39, not an option.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound with elements like Mg (24) and O (16), sum 40, not an option.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D) 29. Let me think: which elements sum to 29. Let's see, 12 (C) +17 (Cl)= 29. So if X contains C and Cl, then their sum is 12+35.5=47.5, which is not 29. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, 14 (N) +15 (O)=29? No, N is 14, O is 16. 14+15=29, but O is 16, so 14+16=30. Close to option D (29), but not exact.

Wait, another thought: the lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is something like Ca (40). Sum is 41. Not an option.

Maybe the lightest is O (16), heaviest is K (39). Sum 55. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and what I know.

The gas W is O2, so the reaction produces O2. The precipitate G, when heated, gives B with a melting point near 277 K (4°C). If B is water, then G must be a hydrate. For example, if G is a copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would release water. But the melting point of water is 273 K, but B's is 277 K. That's close. So perhaps B is water, and G is a hydrate.

So, if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, reacting with water to produce O2 and NaOH. But NaOH is soluble, so that can't be the precipitate. Alternatively, maybe X is BaO2, which reacts with water to produce O2 and Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and is soluble in water, so that doesn't form a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate. For example, if X is a peroxide, and Y is a carbonate solution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like FeSO4·7H2O, which when heated loses water, but that doesn't produce O2.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, and Y is a strong acid. For example, X is Fe, Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce FeSO4, H2 gas, and possibly some SO2 if it's a different reaction. But that doesn't produce O2.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the other part: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's say the product is an ester, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone being converted into something else. Wait, another thought: if X is a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4, and the keto acid is a secondary alcohol, then KMnO4 would oxidize it to a ketone. But that doesn't directly relate to the O count.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, LiAlH4 reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols. The product would have more O, but perhaps in a different form.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal, which has one O. No, that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the fact that the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements is likely 35 (option A). Because earlier I thought X might contain F and O, but their sum is 19+16=35, which matches option A. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering that the product with the keto acid has 2 O atoms, perhaps X is a metal that when reacts with the keto acid forms a salt with 2 O. For example, if X is Mg, reacting with acetic acid (CH3COOH) to form Mg acetate, which has more O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another angle: the product has 2 O atoms. Suppose the product is CO2. Then, the reaction would involve the keto acid losing some O. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether, which has two O atoms. For example, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is something that can form an ether via Williamson synthesis. But I'm not sure.

In any case, I think the intended answer is option C)31, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's option D)29, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the product of X and the keto acid has two O atoms, perhaps it's a molecule like COCl2. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like SOCl2, which reacts with the keto acid to form an acyl chloride. For example, RCOOH + SOCl2 → RCOCl + SO2↑ + HCl↑. The product RCOCl has Cl and O, but the number of O atoms isn't two; it's one O in the COCl group.

Hmm, not matching.

Given all this, I think the most plausible option is A)35, assuming X contains F and O as elements, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)29, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, a precipitate G, and a compound B with a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The task is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W is O₂, as each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making the molecule have 16 protons and 16 neutrons.

2. **Precipitate G and Compound B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of ~277 K (4°C). This melting point aligns with water (H₂O), suggesting B is water. Thus, G could be a hydrate that releases water upon heating.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X reacts with the keto acid in a way that forms a compound with a specific oxygen count, possibly through reduction, dehydration, or substitution.

4. **Substance X**: X is described as incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Likely candidates for X include compounds like Na₂O₂, KMnO₄, or other reagents used in organic reactions.

5. **Atomic Masses of Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be calculated. The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35. These correspond to possible pairs of elements whose atomic masses sum to these values.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (35)**: This could correspond to elements like F (atomic mass ~19) and O (atomic mass ~16), as their sum is 35. However, X must contain both F and O, which is less likely given the context.
- **Option B (25)**: This could correspond to elements like C (12) and N (13), but their sum is 25. This combination does not align with the properties of X.
- **Option C (31)**: This could correspond to elements like P (31) and O (16), as their sum is 31. However, X must contain both P and O, which is less consistent with the given clues.
- **Option D (29)**: This could correspond to elements like N (14) and O (16), as their sum is 29. This combination is plausible, but it does not fully align with the properties of X.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option A (35)**, assuming X contains elements like F and O, as their atomic masses sum to 35. This aligns with the possibility of X incorporating a heavier isotope and being used in organic chemistry.
