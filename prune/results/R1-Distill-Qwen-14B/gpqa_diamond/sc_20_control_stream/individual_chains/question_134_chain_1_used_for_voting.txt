Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the energy change when an acid reacts with a base to produce one mole of water.

The problem gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait, when you mix an acid with a base, it's an acid-base reaction. So I should figure out which are the acids and which is the base here. HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the reaction is between these acids and the base.

But wait, when you mix all three, which of them will actually react? Because the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can provide two OH- ions per formula unit. So when these react, they'll form water and a sulfate salt, perhaps?

Let me think. The general reaction for acid-base neutralization is acid + base → salt + water. But in this case, each acid might react with the base. Or maybe the base will react with both acids. Wait, but when you mix all three, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But wait, mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4, being a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second dissociation is weaker. But in aqueous solution, especially at higher concentrations, H2SO4 tends to dissociate both H+ ions, so I think for this problem, we can consider H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ per molecule.

So, the reaction is between H+ ions from both HCl and H2SO4 and OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will combine with the OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- available, and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each reactant.

1. Moles of HCl: Volume (L) × Molarity = 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each HCl gives one H+ ion, so 0.1 mol H+.

2. Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, it gives 2 H+ per molecule, so 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

3. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ available: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol H+.

Total OH- available: 0.2 mol.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy of this reaction per mole is typically about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but I think for this problem, we might need to use the standard value of -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait—wait, wait a second. Wait, the sum of moles of H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So which is the limiting reactant here? Because OH- is less than H+, so OH- will be the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be in excess.

So the reaction will proceed until all OH- is consumed. So the moles of water formed from neutralization will be 0.2 mol.

Wait a minute, but wait—H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Oh, but in the case of mixing with a base, each H+ from H2SO4 will react with OH-.

So the limiting reagent is the OH- here. So the moles of H+ that will react are equal to the moles of OH-, which is 0.2 mol. Because each OH- can combine with one H+.

So the total enthalpy change will be the moles of H+ reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+. So 0.2 mol × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the calculated value is about -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not exact. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, there's a discrepancy between kJ and kcal.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as about -57 kJ per mole, but sometimes it's also given in kcal. Let me recall: 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. Wait, no, 57 kJ is 57000 J. 57000 /4184 ≈ around 13.6 kcal.

Wait, but I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often quoted as -57 kJ/mol or about -13.8 kcal/mol. Wait, maybe I should check that.

Wait, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,000 J is 57 kJ, which is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ approximately 13.6 kcal.

Wait, but sometimes the value is given as -57.3 kJ/mol, which is about -13.66 kcal/mol. Hmm.

Wait, but in the problem, when we have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, each contributing about -57 kJ (or about -13.6 kcal), so 0.2 × -57.3 kJ would be -11.46 kJ, and 0.2 × -13.66 kcal would be about -2.73 kcal.

Wait, that's conflicting. So which unit is the correct one? The options have both kcal and kJ.

So let's think again. The problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. The magnitude depends on the amount of H+ and OH- that react.

Wait, but wait. The total moles of H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. The moles of OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent, and 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × ΔH per mole.

Assuming ΔH is -57 kJ per mole: 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that would be option D, which is -16.0 kJ. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the initial moles.

Wait, HCl is 500 mL (0.5 L) × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 is 300 mL (0.3 L) × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL (0.2 L) × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

In the neutralization, each H+ reacts with OH- to form H2O, releasing energy. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole for strong acids and strong bases, but wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second might be weaker. So does that affect the enthalpy?

Hmm, if H2SO4 is considered a strong acid, then both H+ ions are available, so the calculation would proceed as before. But if the second H+ is weaker, maybe the enthalpy change is less.

Wait, but in the problem's context, it's probably assumed that both H+ ions are available, so proceed with 0.18 mol H+ from H2SO4.

Thus, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Alternatively, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.73 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.727). But I'm not seeing that as an option.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So my calculation with -11.4 kJ isn't exactly matching any option, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H2O formed, but in cases where multiple H+ are involved, like with H2SO4, we need to account for each H+ separately.

Wait, but in the case of H2SO4, since both H+ are reacting, each contributes to the enthalpy. So, for HCl, each mole contributes one H+, and for H2SO4, each mole contributes two H+.

But then, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28. But the OH- is 0.2 moles, so only 0.2 moles of H+ will react. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the value used is different.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using kcal instead of kJ. Let's try that. Because 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal.

So 0.2 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. To convert to kcal: 11.46 /4.184 ≈ approximately 2.736 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. Hmm, so why the discrepancy in the units?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which acid contributes how much H+.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the total H+ and OH- and determine how much reacts.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol, and each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol, each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So, OH- is limiting, 0.2 H+ reacts.

Each H+ neutralization releases 57 kJ/mol, so 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have 11.4 kJ as an option. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for each H+ is -57.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, maybe the calculation is done differently. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the combining of H+ and OH- in a 1:1 ratio, so for each mole of H+ that reacts, one mole of H2O is formed, releasing energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So 0.2 moles reacting would give 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again: option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 48.3 kJ (since 11.42 ×4.184 ≈ 48.2 kJ). Hmm, that's not matching my earlier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is different. Wait, because H2SO4's second H+ is a weaker acid, perhaps the enthalpy change is not as exothermic for that second H+.

Wait, but I think in the context of this problem, it's assumed that both H+ ions from H2SO4 are available for neutralization, so the calculation stands as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and then compute based on the heat of reaction.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 specifically, and HCl separately.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will react with the strong acids present. Let's think about the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, that's the balanced equation. So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

In terms of H+ and OH-, each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ and each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so the reaction would involve 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2, two moles of H+ are neutralized.

Similarly, HCl provides one H+ per mole.

So perhaps I should calculate the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 and see how much can react.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is in lesser quantity (0.09 mol) compared to Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol). So H2SO4 is the limiting reactant.

In the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 requires one mole of Ba(OH)2, and produces 2 moles of H2O.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 would require 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.18 mol H2O.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 mol available. So after reacting 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, 0.01 mol remains.

So after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which can provide 0.02 mol OH-.

Then, the HCl will react with the remaining OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

The remaining OH- is 0.02 mol. So H+ from HCl will neutralize this OH-.

So, H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol, OH- remaining: 0.02 mol.

So 0.02 mol H+ will react with OH- to form water.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized are:

From H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction: 0.09 mol H2SO4 × 2 H+ per mole = 0.18 mol H+.

From HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol H+.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.20 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

But the options don't have this value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 only donates one H+ in the first dissociation, but that's not usually the case in strong acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: The total moles of H+ available are 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

The total moles of OH- available are 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, none of the kJ options match exactly. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, which is also diprotic, the reaction might produce more water.

Wait, the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2 is: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, two moles of H+ are neutralized.

So the moles of H+ from H2SO4 that react is 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 mol.

The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 reacting with H2SO4 is 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 mol, so it can provide 0.2 mol OH-.

So after the H2SO4 is fully consumed, there's 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 left, which can provide 0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol OH-.

The HCl provides 0.1 mol H+, which will react with 0.02 mol OH-.

So the total H+ that reacts is 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.20 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

Again, looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal. Let me see.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. But that's option A: -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -3.80 kcal per mole.

Wait, but that would be way too low. 0.2 moles × (-3.80 kcal/mol) is -0.76 kcal. That's not matching any option.

Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is being considered per mole of acid. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me check again.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L ×0.5 M=0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So, yes, H+ total 0.28, OH- 0.2. So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 H+ react.

So 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be about -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe the problem is using a different value, such as -13.66 kcal/mol (since 57.3 kJ is about 13.66 kcal), so 0.2 mol × (-13.66 kcal/mol) is -2.732 kcal.

That would match option A (-2.72 kcal). But wait, that would be if we're using kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, but earlier calculation was 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately 2.73 kcal.

So, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

But why would the problem not have the kJ option? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the solutions are mixed." So perhaps I should consider the total enthalpy change, which is the sum of all reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is considered per mole of reaction as written, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for example, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

The balanced equation would be 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each of these reactions has an associated enthalpy change.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: Calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH- total: 0.2 mol.

So, moles of H+ that react: 0.2 mol.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

The options don't have this. But perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of acid used, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects the answer in kilocalories, but using the value of -57.3 kJ/mol, which is -13.66 kcal/mol. So 0.2 × (-13.66) = -2.732 kcal.

Which matches option A (-2.72 kcal). But why would they use kcal here? Because the options have both units, but no option matches the kJ calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, H2SO4: 300 mL × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each gives two H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

HCl: 0.5 L ×0.2 M =0.1 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M =0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts.

So 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ, but negative.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher, so not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value, such as per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, each mole of H2O forms from one H+ and one OH-.

So the enthalpy per mole of H2O is about -28.4 kJ (since 57.3 kJ per 2 H2O molecules, so 28.65 kJ per H2O).

Wait, but that's per mole. So 0.2 moles of H2O would release 0.2 ×28.65 = 5.73 kJ, which is not matching any option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the value of -57 kJ per mole of acid, regardless of the H+ count.

Wait, that would be incorrect, but perhaps in this problem, they're considering the total moles of acid contributing.

But that doesn't make much sense, because H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sum the moles of H+ and OH- and see the minimum.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering only the first dissociation of H2SO4, treating it as a monoprotic acid. In that case, H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 mol H+.

So total H+ would be 0.1 + 0.09 =0.19 mol.

OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ is limiting, 0.19 mol reacting.

So enthalpy change is 0.19 × (-57.3) =-10.89 kJ, which is approximately -10.9 kJ. Not matching any option either.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed with the initial correct calculation, which is -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B: -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.42 kcal is about 48.7 kJ, which is much higher than the 11.46 kJ I calculated. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is considering the reaction as a combination of neutralization reactions, and the calculation is done per mole of H+ consumed. So the total is 0.2 mol ×57.3 kJ.

So 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ. So the answer would be -11.46 kJ. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal. But that would require the per mole value to be about -57.1 kcal/mol, which is not standard. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kilocalories, using 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal. Wait, no, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 11.46 kJ ×0.239 ≈ 2.73 kcal. Which matches option A: -2.72 kcal.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn because the calculations point to about -11.46 kJ, but the only option close in kcal is option A, which is -2.72 kcal. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct option is D, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking for the total enthalpy when all three solutions are mixed, regardless of stoichiometry, and the enthalpy is calculated as the sum of each neutralization reaction.

For example:

1. Neutralization of HCl with Ba(OH)2.

2. Neutralization of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

But I think that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, the reaction produces more than one mole of water, so the enthalpy is scaled accordingly.

Wait, the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the sum of the enthalpies of neutralization of both H+ ions from H2SO4 with OH-.

Each H+ neutralization releases about -57.3 kJ, so two would release -114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4 reacted.

So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, the enthalpy change would be 0.09 × (-114.6) = -10.314 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which can react with 0.01 × 2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

The HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 not used in the first reaction is 0.02 mol, which reacts with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 × (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is -10.314 + (-1.146) = -11.46 kJ.

Again, about -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the problem uses the value of -3.80 kcal per mole of H+.

So 0.2 × (-3.80) = -0.76 kcal, which doesn't match any options except option C (-3.80 kcal), but that's way off.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change in kilocalories, so 11.46 kJ is 2.727 kcal, which is approximately option A (-2.72 kcal).

Therefore, the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each HCl molecule contributes 1 H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each H₂SO₄ molecule contributes 2 H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule contributes 2 OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it is present in smaller quantity.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ react with 0.2 moles of OH⁻, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
     Converting to kilocalories:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.732 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

4. **Match the result with the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change in kilocalories (\( -2.732 \, \text{kcal} \)) closely matches option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)).  
   - None of the kJ options (e.g., \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) align with the calculated value.

**Conclusion:** The enthalpy of neutralization is best represented by option A, \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), based on the given data and assumptions.
