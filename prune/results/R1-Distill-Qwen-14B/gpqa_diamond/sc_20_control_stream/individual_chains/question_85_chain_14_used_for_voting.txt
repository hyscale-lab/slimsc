Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Wait, or was it the other way around with the square root?

Wait, let me get this straight. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_s * (R_s/(2a))^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo. Oh, wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me think again. The standard formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( (L / L_sun) )^(1/4 )? No, wait, the star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star²σT_eff⁴. So L is proportional to R² T_eff⁴. 

But equilibrium temperature also depends on the distance a. The formula I recall is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Wait, no, let me think about the formula correctly. The planet absorbs energy from the star and radiates as a blackbody. The flux at the planet's distance is F = L/(4πa²). The planet's cross-section is πR_p², so the absorbed power is F * πR_p² * (1 - A). The planet emits as a blackbody with surface area 4πR_p², so the power is 4πR_p² * σ T_p^4. Setting them equal: F * π (1 - A) = 4 σ T_p^4. 

Substituting F = L/(4πa²) gives: L/(4πa²) * π(1 - A) = 4 σ T_p^4. Simplifying: L (1 - A) / (4 a²) ) = 4 σ T_p^4. So T_p^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²). 

But L is the star's luminosity, which is 4π R_star² σ T_eff^4. Substitute that in: T_p^4 = (4 π R_star² σ T_eff^4)(1 - A) / (16 π σ a²). Simplify numerator and denominator: 4 π cancels with 16 π, giving 1/4. So T_p^4 = (R_star² T_eff^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a²). Taking the fourth root, T_p = T_eff * (R_star / (2 a))^(1/2) * ( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) ). 

So that's the formula. Now, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is the same for both. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on sqrt( (R_star / (2 a1)) ) / sqrt( (R_star / (2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, no, wait: T_p ~ sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) so T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because R_star cancels, and 2 is a constant denominator.

So I need to find the ratio a2/a1 to find the temperature ratio.

But how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives data about the Doppler shifts. So each planet's mass and the induced Doppler shift can help find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, the Doppler method (radial velocity) gives the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star. The shift in the spectral lines is due to the star's velocity towards and away from us as the planet orbits.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G (M_star + M_planet) P ) / (2π c (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) * something else... Wait, maybe it's better to use the simplified formula for circular orbits (e=0), and assume i=90 degrees (edge-on, so sin i =1, which is the case for transit method, since transit happens only if the orbit is edge-on, so i=90). So sin i is 1.

The RV semi-amplitude for circular orbit is given by K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

But wait, K is also given by another formula. Let me think. The formula is K = ( (v) ) = [ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(c * a * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, I know that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (2 π G ) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, but this might not be the right formula. Alternatively, another approach: The RV method gives the mass of the planet as a function of the semi-major axis. But perhaps it's better to relate the semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and the mass.

Alternatively, considering that the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the distance a. For circular orbit (e=0), the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi c)) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (a^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and a. Because for a planet with mass M_p, the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 1 / ( (2 π a) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(c) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the formula again.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (a (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) ) ]^(1/1) * ( (1) / (2 π c) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula from memory.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (2 π / P ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (c) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), 1-sqrt(1-e²)=1, so this simplifies.

But perhaps another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me think. The formula is K = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ something ) * ( ... )

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that for small planetary masses compared to the star, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (2 π / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to relate the velocities of the two planets. Since the problem gives the Doppler shift (K) for each planet, which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. Wait, but units are important here. Because Doppler shift is often in velocity units, measured in m/s or km/s, but the shifts here are given in Angstroms. Hmm, I think we can relate the shifts to velocities using the formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately equal to v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So if the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, then Δλ is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So the velocity v is (Δλ / λ) * c.

So K1 = (0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m ) * c.

Wait, more accurately, the Doppler shift is v = c * (Δλ / λ). So for each planet, the K (semi-amplitude) is the velocity of the star. So:

K1 = (0.03 Å / 6300 Å) * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 Å /6300 Å) * c.

But c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So let me compute K1 and K2 in m/s.

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s? Wait, no. Wait, 1 m = 1e10 Å. So 6300 Å is 6300e-10 m. So Δλ is 0.03e-10 m. So v = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.

So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but c is 3e8 m/s. So compute the velocities.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e6) ) ≈ 4.76e-7.

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = (3e-2) / (6.3e3) ) = (3/(6.3)) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476e-5 ≈ 4.76e-6.

So v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s ≈ 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) *3e8 m/s.

0.04/6300 =4e-2 /6.3e3=4/(6.3e5)= approx 6.349e-6.

v2=6.349e-6 *3e8 = 1.9047e3 m/s ≈ 1.905 km/s.

So K1 ≈1.428e3 m/s, K2≈1.905e3 m/s.

Now, what's the relation between K and a (semi-major axis of the planet's orbit)? The K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (2π a) )^(1/3) ) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / (2 π a (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c ) )

But since e=0, this simplifies to:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2 π a )) )^(1/3) ) * (1/c )

But since sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit), and M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( G M_p )/( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 π a ))^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me write this as:

K = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/1) ) / ( (M_star^(1/3)) (2 π a )^(1/3) )) ) * (1/c^(1/1) )

Wait, alternatively, let's cube both sides to eliminate the cube roots.

K³ = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star² (2 π a ) ) ) / c³.

Wait, let me reorganize:

K = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) (2 π a )^(1/3) ) ) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write K in terms of a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using their K values.

Let's cube both sides of the K formula.

K³ = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( ( M_star )^(1) (2 π a ) ) ) / c³.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let me think again.

The equation is:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(2 pi a (1-e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Since e=0, and M_p << M_star,

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a ))^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me cube both sides:

K³ = [ G³ M_p³ / M_star ] * [ 1/(2 pi a ) ] / c³.

Rearranging:

a = G³ M_p³ / ( M_star * 2 pi c³ K³ ) )

Wait, that can't be right because the dimensions don't match. Alternatively, maybe I can express (a) in terms of K, M_p, and M_star.

Alternatively, let me write the formula as:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me isolate a:

(1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) = K c / ( G M_p / M_star^(1/3) )

Raise both sides to the 3rd power:

1/(2 pi a ) = (K c )^3 / ( G^3 M_p^3 / M_star )

Multiply both sides by 2 pi a:

1 = 2 pi a * ( K^3 c^3 ) / ( G^3 M_p^3 / M_star )

Rearranged:

a = ( G^3 M_p^3 M_star ) / ( 2 pi K^3 c^3 M_p^3 ) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me try again.

Starting from K = [ G M_p / M_star^(1/3) ) ] * [1/(2 pi a )]^(1/3) / c.

Let me cube both sides:

K³ = [ G³ M_p³ / M_star ] * [1/(2 pi a ) ] / c³.

Multiply both sides by (2 pi a ):

2 pi a K³ = ( G³ M_p³ ) / M_star * (1/c³ )

So,

a = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star * 2 pi K³ c³ ).

Wait, that makes sense in terms of units.

Now, since we're dealing with two planets, let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of their respective K and M_p.

But wait, let's first write the formula for a:

a = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star * 2 pi K³ c³ )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check the units.

G has units N·m²/kg² = m³/(kg s²).

M_p is kg.

K is m/s.

c is m/s.

So G³ is (m³/(kg s²))³) = m^9/(kg^3 s^6).

M_p³ is kg^3.

M_star is kg.

K³ is (m/s)^3 = m^3/s^3.

c³ is (m/s)^3 = m^3/s^3.

2 pi is dimensionless.

So numerator: G³ M_p³ = (m^9 / kg^3 s^6) ) * kg^3 ) = m^9 / s^6.

Denominator: M_star * 2 pi K³ c³ = kg * (m^3/s^3) * (m^3/s^3) ) = kg m^6 / s^6.

So overall, a = (m^9 / s^6 ) / ( kg m^6 / s^6 ) ) * (1/( kg )) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the formula should have units of meters. Let me see:

G has units of m^3/(kg s²).

M_p is kg.

So G*(M_p) has units m^3/(s²).

K is m/s.

K^3 is m^3/s^3.

c^3 is m^3/s^3.

So let's compute the denominator and numerator:

Numerator: G^3 * M_p^3 → (m^9/kg^3 s^6) ) * kg^3 → m^9 / s^6.

Denominator: M_star * 2 pi * K^3 * c^3 → kg * (m^3/s^3) * (m^3/s^3) ) → kg m^6/s^6.

So the entire fraction is (m^9/s^6) / (kg m^6 / s^6) ) → (m^3) / kg.

But we have 1/(kg) from the denominator? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the formula a = ( (G M_p )^3 ) / ( ( M_star ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * K^3 c^3 )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that a is proportional to (M_p^3 )/( M_star^(1/3) K^3 ) ). Because if I take the formula and look for the dependence:

From K = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) / c.

Then, rearranging for a:

(1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) = K c ( M_star^(1/3) ) / ( G M_p )

Cube both sides:

1/(2 pi a ) = ( K c )^3 ( M_star ) ) / ( G^3 M_p^3 )

Multiply both sides by 2 pi a:

1 = 2 pi a * ( K^3 c^3 M_star ) / ( G^3 M_p^3 )

So,

a = G^3 M_p^3 / ( 2 pi K^3 c^3 M_star )

So yes, a is proportional to ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 M_star )

So a ∝ ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 M_star )

Because G and c are constants, and 2 pi is a constant.

So, for each planet, a1 and a2 are proportional to ( M_p^3 )/( K^3 M_star )

So, the ratio a1/a2 = [ (M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) / M_star ] / [ (M_p2^3 / K2^3 ) / M_star ] = ( M_p1^3 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

Wait, because the M_star cancels out.

So a1/a2 = ( M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) * ( K2^3 / M_p2^3 )

Which simplifies to (M_p1/M_p2 )^3 ( K2/K1 )^3.

So,

a1/a2 = ( ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2 / K1 ) )^3

Because each term is cubed.

So, a1/a2 = ( (7 /5 ) * (0.04 / 0.03) )^3.

Let me compute the numbers.

0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 ≈1.3333.

7/5 = 1.4.

So 1.4 * 1.3333 ≈ (1.4 * 1.3333) ≈ 1.8666...

So (1.8666)^3 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.8666^3.

1.8^3 = 5.832.

0.0666 is about 2/30, so 1.8666 is 1.8 + 0.0666.

Let me compute (1.8 + 0.0666)^3.

Approximately: 1.8³ + 3*(1.8)^2 *0.0666 + 3*1.8*(0.0666)^2 + (0.0666)^3.

1.8³ =5.832.

(1.8)^2=3.24. 3.24 *0.0666≈0.216. Multiply by 3: 0.648.

Then, 3*1.8*(0.0666)^2=5.4 *0.004435≈0.024.

(0.0666)^3≈0.000296.

Adding these up: 5.832 + 0.648=6.48; +0.024=6.504; +0.0003=6.5043.

So, approximately 6.504.

So a1 / a2 ≈6.504.

So a1 ≈6.504 * a2.

Wait, but wait, if a1/a2= ( (7/5) * (0.04/0.03) )^3 = (1.4 * 1.333... )^3 ≈ (1.8667)^3≈ 6.504.

Wait, but earlier calculation: 1.8667^3≈6.504.

So a1 is about 6.5 times a2.

But we're interested in T_p1 / T_p2. Earlier, we found that T_p ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because T_p ~ sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

Since a1/a2 ≈6.5,

sqrt(a2/a1 )= 1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 1/2.55 ≈0.392.

So T_p1 / T_p2 ≈0.392.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.392. Let me check the options: the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.3, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

Hmm, 0.39 is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the a1/a2 ratio.

Wait, a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^3 * ( K2/K1 )^3.

M_p1=7, M_p2=5.

K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.905 km/s.

So K2/K1=1.905/1.428≈1.333.

So (7/5)^3= (1.4)^3=2.744.

(1.333)^3≈ (4/3)^3=64/27≈2.37.

Multiply 2.744 * 2.37 ≈6.504.

So a1/a2≈6.504.

Thus, a1 is 6.5 times a2. Then a2 is a1 /6.5.

Wait, no, a1 =6.5 a2.

So a1 =6.5 a2.

Thus, a2 =a1 /6.5.

So when we compute T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (a1/6.5)/a1 ) )= sqrt(1/6.5)≈0.392.

So T_p1 is about 0.392 times T_p2.

But the options don't have 0.392. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the proportionality backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, a1/a2 is ( M_p1^3 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

So a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )

Wait, 0.04/0.03 is 4/3, not 0.04/0.03=4/3.

Ah, no, that's correct. So (4/3)^3=64/27≈2.37.

(7/5)^3=343/125=2.744.

So 2.744 * 2.37 ≈6.504.

So a1 is 6.5 times a2.

But then the temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/6.5)=0.392.

Not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the way K relates to a.

Let me think again: from K = ( G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a (1-e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ) / c.

But for the purposes of ratios, perhaps it's better to write the ratio of the velocities, K1 and K2, and relate it to the cube roots of (M_p / ( a K )).

Wait, because K is proportional to ( M_p / ( a^(1/3) ) ), perhaps.

Wait, let's re-derive the formula correctly.

The formula for K is:

K = ( ( G * M_p * sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (2 pi a (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Assuming e=0 and sin i=1, and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So,

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 pi a ))^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me cube both sides:

K³ ≈ ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star ) * (1/(2 pi a )) ) / c³.

Then,

(2 pi a ) = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star K³ c³ ) * (1/(2 pi a ))^( -1 )

Wait, perhaps rearrange to solve for a:

(2 pi a ) = ( G³ M_p^3 ) / ( M_star K^3 c^3 )

Wait,

a = ( G³ M_p^3 ) / ( 2 pi M_star K^3 c^3 )

So, a ∝ ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 )

Because G, c, and pi are constants.

So the ratio a1/a2 is ( ( M_p1^3 ) / ( K1^3 ) ) / ( ( M_p2^3 ) / ( K2^3 ) ) ) = ( M_p1^3 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So a1/a2= (7^3 * (0.04)^3 ) / (5^3 * (0.03)^3 )

Wait, but 0.04 and 0.03 are the K values in units that we converted into m/s, so K1=1.428e3 m/s, K2=1.905e3 m/s.

Wait, no, actually, in the formula a ∝ ( M_p^3 / K^3 ), so the ratio a1/a2 is:

( (7^3 ) / (K1^3) ) / ( (5^3 ) / ( K2^3 ) ) ) = (7^3 * K2^3 ) / (5^3 * K1^3 )

So,

a1/a2= (343 * (1.905e3)^3 ) / (125 * (1.428e3)^3 )

But since the (1e3)^3 terms would be (1e9), but they cancel when taking the ratio.

So, a1/a2 = (343/125) * ( (1.905)/(1.428) )^3.

Compute 343/125=2.744.

Compute 1.905 /1.428 ≈1.333.

So,

a1/a2= 2.744 * (1.333)^3.

(1.333)^3= (4/3)^3=64/27≈2.37037.

So,

a1/a2= 2.744 * 2.37037≈6.504.

So same result as before.

So, a1=6.504 a2.

Then, the ratio T_p1 / T_p2 is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/6.504 )≈0.392.

But none of the options are near 0.39. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratios inverted. Because I might have confused a1 and a2 in the K relation.

Wait, in the earlier step: a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, a2 of Planet2.

Given that K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.905 km/s.

So, the ratio a1/a2= (7^3 * (0.04)^3 ) / (5^3 * (0.03)^3 ) ? No, that's not correct because we're using the actual K values, which are in m/s.

Wait, let me compute K1=1.428e3 m/s, K2=1.905e3 m/s.

So,

a1/a2= (7^3 * (K2)^3 ) / (5^3 * K1^3 )

= (343 * (1.905e3)^3 ) / (125 * (1.428e3)^3 )

= (343/125) * (1.905/1.428 )^3

Same as earlier.

So, same calculation, same result.

Hmm, so the temperature ratio is about 0.392. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the equilibrium temperature formula includes the square of the inverse of the distance, not the square root. Wait, let me recheck the formula.

Equilibrium temperature formula:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, earlier I thought it was sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

But wait, let me re-derive it.

The star's flux at the planet is F = L/(4 pi a²).

The planet absorbs F * (pi R_p²) * (1 - A) = F * sigma (absorbed energy).

The planet radiates as a blackbody: 4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Setting them equal:

F * pi R_p² (1 - A) = 4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Cancel R_p² and pi: F (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

F = L/(4 pi a² ), so:

(L/(4 pi a² )) (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

L is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So,

(4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 )/(4 pi a² ) * (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

Simplify:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 )/(a²) (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

Divide both sides by 4 sigma:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - A) )/(4 sigma a² ) )= T_p^4.

Take the fourth root:

T_p = T_star * ( R_star/(2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So yes, the formula is correct.

Thus, T_p is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So with a1=6.5 a2, T_p1 = T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5)≈0.392 T_p2.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the a ratio.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K was miscalculated. Let me think: perhaps K is proportional to ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) a^(1/3) )

So K = ( (G M_p )/( M_star ) )^(1/1) * (1/(a ))^(1/3 ) * (1/(c )) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. It's better to think in terms of the RV formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to relate the semi-major axis with the RV semi-amplitude:

The formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( 2 pi c ( M_star )^(2/3) (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) )

But since P is the period, which I don't have.

Wait, but without knowing P, perhaps we can relate K1 and K2 for the same star.

Alternatively, for the same star, the two planets have different K's.

But perhaps I can relate K1 and K2 to their respective periods and a.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that since K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3), then a is proportional to (M_p^3 )/( K^3 ), as before.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the Doppler shifts are given in Angstroms, and perhaps I should not convert them to velocities but use them directly in the formula as they are.

Wait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. So, perhaps I should not convert these shifts to velocities but use them in the formula. Because in the formula, K is in velocity units, but perhaps the ratio can be taken directly.

Wait, but the formula for a in terms of K uses K in velocity units. So to compute a correctly, perhaps I should convert the shifts to velocities.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K. Let me recompute the K's.

The forbidden line is at 6300 Å. Each planet causes a shift of 0.03 Å (Planet1) and 0.04 Å (Planet2).

The Doppler shift formula is v = c (Δλ / λ).

So for Planet1: v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 ). Similarly for Planet2: v2= c * (0.04 /6300 ).

Compute v1 and v2:

v1= (3e8 m/s) * (0.03 /6300) ) = 3e8 * (3e-3 /6.3e3 )= 3e8 * (4.76e-7)≈1.428e3 m/s.

v2=3e8 * (0.04/6300 )=3e8 * (4e-3/6.3e3 )=3e8 * (6.349e-7 )=1.905e3 m/s.

So K1=1.428e3 m/s, K2=1.905e3 m/s.

So earlier calculations are correct.

So a1/a2= (7^3 * (1.905e3)^3 ) / (5^3 * (1.428e3 )^3 ) )= (343/125) * (1.905/1.428)^3.

Which is (2.744) * (1.333)^3.

As before, 1.333^3≈2.370, so 2.744 *2.370≈6.504.

So a1=6.5 a2.

Thus, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5 )= T_p2 * 0.392.

So, the ratio T_p1/T_p2≈0.392, which is approximately 0.39. But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I confused the K values. Because the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. So in terms of velocity, K1=0.03/6300 *c, K2=0.04/6300 *c.

But in the a formula, a is proportional to (M_p^3 )/( K^3 ). So in our earlier calculation, K1=0.03/6300 *c, K2=0.04/6300 *c. But perhaps I should think in terms of their ratio, K1/K2= (0.03)/(0.04 )=3/4=0.75.

Wait, but in the a formula, a is proportional to ( M_p^3 )/( K^3 ), so a1/a2= ( M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) * ( K2^3 / M_p2^3 )

Which is ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (K2/K1 )^3 )

So,

a1/a2= (343/125) * (0.04/0.03 )^3= (2.744) * (4/3 )^3=2.744 * 64/27≈2.744*2.37≈6.504.

So same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature is given by T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Since (1 - A) is same for both, this term cancels in the ratio.

So T_p1/T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / ( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2/a1 )= 1/sqrt( a1/a2 )

We have a1/a2=6.504, so T_p1/T_p2=1/sqrt(6.504)≈0.392.

But the options are A:0.98, B:1.30, C:0.53, D:1.05.

Hmm, 0.392 isn't there. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the RV method's relation to the semi-major axis. Another way: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1/(2 pi a (1 -e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

But for M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me express this as K = ( G/(c) ) * ( M_p / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) )

Cube both sides:

K³ = ( G³ / c³ ) * ( M_p³ ) / ( M_star ) ) * (1/(2 pi a ) )

Solve for a:

a = G³ M_p^3 / ( c³ K³ M_star 2 pi )

So a ∝ ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 M_star )

But in the ratio a1/a2, M_star cancels because same for both.

So,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 / K2^3 ) )= ( (7/5 )^3 ) * ( ( K2/K1 )^3 )

Which is same as earlier.

So, K2/K1=(0.04/0.03 ) * (c /c )=4/3.

So,

a1/a2= (7/5 )^3 * (4/3 )^3= (343/125 )*(64/27 )= (343 *64 )/(125 *27 )

Compute numerator:343 *64= 21952.

Denominator:125 *27=3375.

So,

a1/a2= 21952 /3375≈6.504.

Same result.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/6.504 )=0.392.

But the closest option is C) ~0.53, which is about 0.53.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature uses the star's flux as F = L/(4 pi a² ), and the planet's energy balance is F*(1 - A) = sigma T_p^4.

Wait, no, the correct equation is:

( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) = T_p^4.

Wait, let me re-derive it.

The star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

The planet intercepts a cross-sectional area of pi R_p^2, so the absorbed power is F * pi R_p^2 (1 - A ), where F is the flux at the planet's distance. F = L/(4 pi a² ).

So,

Power_absorbed = F * pi R_p² (1 - A )= (L/(4 pi a² )) * pi R_p² (1-A )= L R_p² (1-A )/(4 a² )

The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4 pi R_p², so Power_radiated=4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Setting them equal:

L R_p² (1-A )/(4 a² )=4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Cancel R_p²:

L (1 - A )/(4 a² )=4 pi sigma T_p^4.

L is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

Substitute:

(4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) (1 - A )/(4 a² )=4 pi sigma T_p^4.

Cancel 4 pi sigma on both sides:

R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A )/(a² )=4 T_p^4.

So,

T_p^4= ( R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A ) )/(4 a² )

Take fourth root:

T_p = T_star * ( R_star/(2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A ) )^(1/4 )

So, the formula is correct.

Hmm, so back to the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio a1/a2 correctly.

Wait, M_p1=7, M_p2=5.

K1=0.03/6300 *c, K2=0.04/6300 *c.

So, K1/K2=0.03/0.04=3/4.

Thus, K2/K1=4/3.

So,

a1/a2= ( (7/5 )^3 ) * ( (4/3 )^3 ) = (343/125 ) * (64/27 )= (343 *64 )/(125 *27 )= (21952 )/(3375 )≈6.504.

So, same as before.

So, the a ratio is correct.

Thus, T_p1 is about 0.392 T_p2.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the albedo. The problem states both planets have the same albedo, so that term cancels, which I accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up a1 and a2 in the temperature ratio.

Wait, T_p1 is for Planet1, which has a1=6.5 a2.

So, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5 )= T_p2 * 0.392.

So, T_p1 is cooler than T_p2.

Looking at the options, none are near 0.39. The closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's about 0.53, which is higher than 0.39.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K calculation. Let me recheck.

K1=0.03 Å / 6300 Å *c.

0.03/6300= 3e-3 /6.3e3= 3/(6.3e6)= approx 4.76e-7.

v1=4.76e-7 *3e8=1.428e3 m/s.

Similarly, K2=0.04/6300=4e-3/6.3e3=4/(6.3e6)=6.349e-7.

v2=6.349e-7 *3e8=1.905e3 m/s.

So calculations are correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps I made an error in cube calculation. Let me re-calculate (7/5 *4/3 )^3.

7/5=1.4, 4/3≈1.3333.

1.4 *1.3333=1.8666.

1.8666^3=?

Let me compute 1.8666^3:

1.8^3=5.832.

0.0666^3≈0.000296.

But using (a + b)^3 =a^3 +3a²b +3ab² +b^3.

a=1.8, b=0.0666.

a^3=5.832.

3a² b=3*(3.24)*(0.0666)=3*3.24=9.72 *0.0666≈0.647.

3a b²=3 *1.8 * (0.004435 )=5.4 *0.004435≈0.0239.

b^3≈0.000296.

Total≈5.832 +0.647=6.479 +0.0239=6.5029 +0.000296≈6.503.

So, 6.503. So a1/a2=6.503.

So, same as before.

Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option D), but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to swap the K values.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, which is smaller than Planet2's 0.04 Å. So K2>K1, implying a2 > a1? Because K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3).

Wait, because a is proportional to ( M_p^3 )/( K^3 ), so higher K means smaller a.

So, K2>K1 → a2 < a1.

Wait, let me think. For example, if K is larger, a is smaller.

So, Planet2 has a larger K (0.04) than Planet1 (0.03), which means a2 is smaller than a1.

So, a1 >a2.

So, the temperature ratio T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )= T_p2 * sqrt( 1/( a1/a2 ) )

But a1/a2=6.5, so T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5 )=0.392.

But the options don't have 0.392.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2.

Hmm, if T1=0.392 T2, then T1/T2=0.392.

But in the options, the closest is C) 0.53.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is a1/a2= (7/5 )^3 * (0.04/0.03 )^3= (343/125) * (64/27 )= (343*64)/(125*27 )= 21952/3375≈6.504.

Thus, a1=6.5 a2.

So, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2 /a1 )= sqrt(1/6.5 )= ~0.392.

So, the ratio is ~0.39.

But among the options, only C is less than 1, which is 0.53.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the equilibrium temperature should be inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, not the cube root.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. It's sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), which is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Thus, if a1=6.5 a2, then T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * 1/sqrt(6.5 )=0.392 T_p2.

So I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended option is C) 0.53.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio because I forgot to cube the K ratio.

Wait, K1=1.428e3, K2=1.905e3.

So, K2/K1=1.905/1.428=1.333.

So, (K2/K1 )^3=(4/3 )^3=64/27≈2.37.

Thus, a1/a2=(7/5 )^3 * (4/3 )^3= (343/125 ) * (64/27 )= (343 *64 )/(125 *27 )= 21952/3375≈6.504.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the cube and just multiply the ratios.

Wait, perhaps the formula for a is proportional to ( M_p / K )^3.

So, a1/a2= ( (7/(0.03) ) / (5/(0.04) ))^3.

Wait, that would be ( (7/5 ) * (0.04/0.03 ) )^3.

Which is same as earlier.

So same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the Doppler shifts in the same order.

If I swap K1 and K2, then a1/a2=(5^3 *0.04^3 )/(7^3 *0.03^3 ).

Which would be (125 * 64e-9 )/(343 *27e-9 )= (125 *64 )/(343 *27 )= (8000 )/(9261 )≈0.863.

So a1=0.863 a2.

Thus, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/0.863 )=sqrt(1.159)=≈1.076.

So, T_p1/T_p2≈1.076, which is close to option D)1.05.

But the problem states K1=0.03 and K2=0.04, so this would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to give K in the same order, but I'm not sure.

In conclusion, given the options, the correct answer based on the problem's data seems to be approximately 0.39, which isn't among the choices. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~1.05, but I can't see how that comes about with the given data.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for K is different. Let me think: perhaps the correct formula uses the cube root of the mass and some other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a (1-e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

But this is the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the intended approach is to find the mass ratio and the Doppler shift ratio, and then find the inverse square root.

Wait, perhaps the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's mass.

Wait, no, the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis and the star's properties, not directly on the planet's mass.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV method, and then compute the equilibrium temperature ratio.

But given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the semi-major axis.

If K ∝ 1/a^(1/3), then a ∝ 1/K^3.

So, a1/a2= ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) * ( M_p1^3 / M_p2^3 )

Which is same as earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D) ~1.05.

Wait, let me compute 1/sqrt(6.5 )=0.392. So, if the ratio is 0.392, then the reciprocal is about 2.55.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the inverse ratio. Suppose T_p2 is sqrt( a1 / a2 ) ×T_star, then T_p2= sqrt(6.5 ) T_p1.

Thus, T_p1/T_p2=1/sqrt(6.5 )=0.392.

But the question asks for T_p1/T_p2, which is 0.392.

No option matches.

In conclusion, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~1.05, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct ratio is closer to 0.53.

Wait, 0.53 is roughly 1/sqrt(3.3 ). So if a1/a2=3.3, which would mean a1=3.3 a2.

But according to our calculation, a1/a2=6.5.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to switch the K values.

If K1=0.04 and K2=0.03, then:

a1/a2= (7^3 * (0.03)^3 )/(5^3 * (0.04)^3 ) )= (343/125 ) * (27/64 )= (2.744 )*(0.421875 )=1.156.

So a1/a2≈1.156.

Thus, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )=1/sqrt(1.156 )=0.936.

But the options don't have this either.

I think I have to go with the calculated value, even if it's not an option. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the equilibrium temperature includes the planet's radius. But no, the formula is only dependent on the star's parameters and the planet's distance. The planet's radius affects the transit depth, not the equilibrium temperature.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * ( R_star/(2a) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ) / ( (1 + B)^(1/4 ) ), where B is the beaming factor. But I don't think so, as beaming is negligible for this level.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the planet's radius in the energy balance, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, the planet's radius cancels out in the energy balance equation. So it doesn't affect the temperature.

Hmm.

In conclusion, I think the correct ratio is approximately 0.39, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio as ( (M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 ) )^3.

Wait, a1/a2= ( M_p1^3 K2^3 )/( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

= ( (7*0.04 )/(5*0.03 ) )^3.

Wait, 7 *0.04=0.28; 5 *0.03=0.15.

So 0.28/0.15≈1.8667.

Cube of that is 6.504.

So same as before.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.39, which isn't listed. But perhaps the intended answer is option D) 1.05, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is T_p1/T_p2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/6.5 )=0.392≈0.4.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to have the same Doppler shifts, but that's not stated.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is not listed, but if I have to choose from the options, perhaps option C) ~0.53 is the closest, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_p = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{Planet1}}}{T_{\text{Planet2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{Planet2}}}{a_{\text{Planet1}}}}
\]

Thus, the temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes (\(a_{\text{Planet1}} / a_{\text{Planet2}}\)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Shifts
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging for \(a\), we find:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^3}{K^3}
\]

For the two planets, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{Planet1}}}{a_{\text{Planet2}}} = \frac{(M_{\text{Planet1}}^3 / K_{\text{Planet1}}^3)}{(M_{\text{Planet2}}^3 / K_{\text{Planet2}}^3)} = \left(\frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{K_{\text{Planet2}}}{K_{\text{Planet1}}}\right)^3
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
- \(M_{\text{Planet1}} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{\text{Planet2}} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_{\text{Planet1}} = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_{\text{Planet2}} = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

First, compute the mass ratio:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Next, compute the RV shift ratio:

\[
\frac{K_{\text{Planet2}}}{K_{\text{Planet1}}} = \frac{0.04}{0.03} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333
\]

Now, cube these ratios:

\[
\left(\frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}}\right)^3 = 1.4^3 = 2.744
\]
\[
\left(\frac{K_{\text{Planet2}}}{K_{\text{Planet1}}}\right)^3 = 1.333^3 \approx 2.37
\]

Finally, calculate the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{Planet1}}}{a_{\text{Planet2}}} = 2.744 \cdot 2.37 \approx 6.504
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio
Using the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{Planet1}}}{T_{\text{Planet2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{Planet2}}}{a_{\text{Planet1}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6.504}} \approx 0.392
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated temperature ratio (\(T_{\text{Planet1}} / T_{\text{Planet2}} \approx 0.392\)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) ~0.53**, which is approximately double the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from an error in the problem setup or assumptions.

### Final Answer

Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Wait, or was it the other way around with the square root?

Wait, let me get this straight. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_s * (R_s/(2a))^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo. Oh, wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me think again. The standard formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( (L / L_sun) )^(1/4 )? No, wait, the star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star²σT_eff⁴. So L is proportional to R² T_eff⁴. 

But equilibrium temperature also depends on the distance a. The formula I recall is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Wait, no, let me think about the formula correctly. The planet absorbs energy from the star and radiates as a blackbody. The flux at the planet's distance is F = L/(4πa²). The planet's cross-section is πR_p², so the absorbed power is F * πR_p² * (1 - A). The planet emits as a blackbody with surface area 4πR_p², so the power is 4πR_p² * σ T_p^4. Setting them equal: F * π (1 - A) = 4 σ T_p^4. 

Substituting F = L/(4πa²) gives: L/(4πa²) * π(1 - A) = 4 σ T_p^4. Simplifying: L (1 - A) / (4 a²) ) = 4 σ T_p^4. So T_p^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²). 

But L is the star's luminosity, which is 4π R_star² σ T_eff^4. Substitute that in: T_p^4 = (4 π R_star² σ T_eff^4)(1 - A) / (16 π σ a²). Simplify numerator and denominator: 4 π cancels with 16 π, giving 1/4. So T_p^4 = (R_star² T_eff^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a²). Taking the fourth root, T_p = T_eff * (R_star / (2 a))^(1/2) * ( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) ). 

So that's the formula. Now, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is the same for both. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on sqrt( (R_star / (2 a1)) ) / sqrt( (R_star / (2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, no, wait: T_p ~ sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) so T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because R_star cancels, and 2 is a constant denominator.

So I need to find the ratio a2/a1 to find the temperature ratio.

But how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives data about the Doppler shifts. So each planet's mass and the induced Doppler shift can help find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, the Doppler method (radial velocity) gives the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star. The shift in the spectral lines is due to the star's velocity towards and away from us as the planet orbits.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G (M_star + M_planet) P ) / (2π c (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) * something else... Wait, maybe it's better to use the simplified formula for circular orbits (e=0), and assume i=90 degrees (edge-on, so sin i =1, which is the case for transit method, since transit happens only if the orbit is edge-on, so i=90). So sin i is 1.

The RV semi-amplitude for circular orbit is given by K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

But wait, K is also given by another formula. Let me think. The formula is K = ( (v) ) = [ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(c * a * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, I know that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (2 π G ) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, but this might not be the right formula. Alternatively, another approach: The RV method gives the mass of the planet as a function of the semi-major axis. But perhaps it's better to relate the semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and the mass.

Alternatively, considering that the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the distance a. For circular orbit (e=0), the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi c)) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (a^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and a. Because for a planet with mass M_p, the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 1 / ( (2 π a) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(c) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the formula again.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (a (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) ) ]^(1/1) * ( (1) / (2 π c) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula from memory.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (2 π / P ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (c) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), 1-sqrt(1-e²)=1, so this simplifies.

But perhaps another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me think. The formula is K = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ something ) * ( ... )

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that for small planetary masses compared to the star, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (2 π / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to relate the velocities of the two planets. Since the problem gives the Doppler shift (K) for each planet, which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. Wait, but units are important here. Because Doppler shift is often in velocity units, measured in m/s or km/s, but the shifts here are given in Angstroms. Hmm, I think we can relate the shifts to velocities using the formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately equal to v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So if the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, then Δλ is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So the velocity v is (Δλ / λ) * c.

So K1 = (0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m ) * c.

Wait, more accurately, the Doppler shift is v = c * (Δλ / λ). So for each planet, the K (semi-amplitude) is the velocity of the star. So:

K1 = (0.03 Å / 6300 Å) * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 Å /6300 Å) * c.

But c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So let me compute K1 and K2 in m/s.

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s? Wait, no. Wait, 1 m = 1e10 Å. So 6300 Å is 6300e-10 m. So Δλ is 0.03e-10 m. So v = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.

So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but c is 3e8 m/s. So compute the velocities.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e6) ) ≈ 4.76e-7.

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = (3e-2) / (6.3e3) ) = (3/(6.3)) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476e-5 ≈ 4.76e-6.

So v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s ≈ 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) *3e8 m/s.

0.04/6300 =4e-2 /6.3e3=4/(6.3e5)= approx 6.349e-6.

v2=6.349e-6 *3e8 = 1.9047e3 m/s ≈ 1.905 km/s.

So K1 ≈1.428e3 m/s, K2≈1.905e3 m/s.

Now, what's the relation between K and a (semi-major axis of the planet's orbit)? The K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (2π a) )^(1/3) ) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / (2 π a (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c ) )

But since e=0, this simplifies to:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2 π a )) )^(1/3) ) * (1/c )

But since sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit), and M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( G M_p )/( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 π a ))^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me write this as:

K = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/1) ) / ( (M_star^(1/3)) (2 π a )^(1/3) )) ) * (1/c^(1/1) )

Wait, alternatively, let's cube both sides to eliminate the cube roots.

K³ = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star² (2 π a ) ) ) / c³.

Wait, let me reorganize:

K = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) (2 π a )^(1/3) ) ) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write K in terms of a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using their K values.

Let's cube both sides of the K formula.

K³ = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( ( M_star )^(1) (2 π a ) ) ) / c³.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let me think again.

The equation is:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(2 pi a (1-e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Since e=0, and M_p << M_star,

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a ))^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me cube both sides:

K³ = [ G³ M_p³ / M_star ] * [ 1/(2 pi a ) ] / c³.

Rearranging:

a = G³ M_p³ / ( M_star * 2 pi c³ K³ ) )

Wait, that can't be right because the dimensions don't match. Alternatively, maybe I can express (a) in terms of K, M_p, and M_star.

Alternatively, let me write the formula as:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me isolate a:

(1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) = K c / ( G M_p / M_star^(1/3) )

Raise both sides to the 3rd power:

1/(2 pi a ) = (K c )^3 / ( G^3 M_p^3 / M_star )

Multiply both sides by 2 pi a:

1 = 2 pi a * ( K^3 c^3 ) / ( G^3 M_p^3 / M_star )

Rearranged:

a = ( G^3 M_p^3 M_star ) / ( 2 pi K^3 c^3 M_p^3 ) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me try again.

Starting from K = [ G M_p / M_star^(1/3) ) ] * [1/(2 pi a )]^(1/3) / c.

Let me cube both sides:

K³ = [ G³ M_p³ / M_star ] * [1/(2 pi a ) ] / c³.

Multiply both sides by (2 pi a ):

2 pi a K³ = ( G³ M_p³ ) / M_star * (1/c³ )

So,

a = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star * 2 pi K³ c³ ).

Wait, that makes sense in terms of units.

Now, since we're dealing with two planets, let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of their respective K and M_p.

But wait, let's first write the formula for a:

a = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star * 2 pi K³ c³ )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check the units.

G has units N·m²/kg² = m³/(kg s²).

M_p is kg.

K is m/s.

c is m/s.

So G³ is (m³/(kg s²))³) = m^9/(kg^3 s^6).

M_p³ is kg^3.

M_star is kg.

K³ is (m/s)^3 = m^3/s^3.

c³ is (m/s)^3 = m^3/s^3.

2 pi is dimensionless.

So numerator: G³ M_p³ = (m^9 / kg^3 s^6) ) * kg^3 ) = m^9 / s^6.

Denominator: M_star * 2 pi K³ c³ = kg * (m^3/s^3) * (m^3/s^3) ) = kg m^6 / s^6.

So overall, a = (m^9 / s^6 ) / ( kg m^6 / s^6 ) ) * (1/( kg )) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the formula should have units of meters. Let me see:

G has units of m^3/(kg s²).

M_p is kg.

So G*(M_p) has units m^3/(s²).

K is m/s.

K^3 is m^3/s^3.

c^3 is m^3/s^3.

So let's compute the denominator and numerator:

Numerator: G^3 * M_p^3 → (m^9/kg^3 s^6) ) * kg^3 → m^9 / s^6.

Denominator: M_star * 2 pi * K^3 * c^3 → kg * (m^3/s^3) * (m^3/s^3) ) → kg m^6/s^6.

So the entire fraction is (m^9/s^6) / (kg m^6 / s^6) ) → (m^3) / kg.

But we have 1/(kg) from the denominator? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the formula a = ( (G M_p )^3 ) / ( ( M_star ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * K^3 c^3 )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that a is proportional to (M_p^3 )/( M_star^(1/3) K^3 ) ). Because if I take the formula and look for the dependence:

From K = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) / c.

Then, rearranging for a:

(1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) = K c ( M_star^(1/3) ) / ( G M_p )

Cube both sides:

1/(2 pi a ) = ( K c )^3 ( M_star ) ) / ( G^3 M_p^3 )

Multiply both sides by 2 pi a:

1 = 2 pi a * ( K^3 c^3 M_star ) / ( G^3 M_p^3 )

So,

a = G^3 M_p^3 / ( 2 pi K^3 c^3 M_star )

So yes, a is proportional to ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 M_star )

So a ∝ ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 M_star )

Because G and c are constants, and 2 pi is a constant.

So, for each planet, a1 and a2 are proportional to ( M_p^3 )/( K^3 M_star )

So, the ratio a1/a2 = [ (M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) / M_star ] / [ (M_p2^3 / K2^3 ) / M_star ] = ( M_p1^3 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

Wait, because the M_star cancels out.

So a1/a2 = ( M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) * ( K2^3 / M_p2^3 )

Which simplifies to (M_p1/M_p2 )^3 ( K2/K1 )^3.

So,

a1/a2 = ( ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2 / K1 ) )^3

Because each term is cubed.

So, a1/a2 = ( (7 /5 ) * (0.04 / 0.03) )^3.

Let me compute the numbers.

0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 ≈1.3333.

7/5 = 1.4.

So 1.4 * 1.3333 ≈ (1.4 * 1.3333) ≈ 1.8666...

So (1.8666)^3 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.8666^3.

1.8^3 = 5.832.

0.0666 is about 2/30, so 1.8666 is 1.8 + 0.0666.

Let me compute (1.8 + 0.0666)^3.

Approximately: 1.8³ + 3*(1.8)^2 *0.0666 + 3*1.8*(0.0666)^2 + (0.0666)^3.

1.8³ =5.832.

(1.8)^2=3.24. 3.24 *0.0666≈0.216. Multiply by 3: 0.648.

Then, 3*1.8*(0.0666)^2=5.4 *0.004435≈0.024.

(0.0666)^3≈0.000296.

Adding these up: 5.832 + 0.648=6.48; +0.024=6.504; +0.0003=6.5043.

So, approximately 6.504.

So a1 / a2 ≈6.504.

So a1 ≈6.504 * a2.

Wait, but wait, if a1/a2= ( (7/5) * (0.04/0.03) )^3 = (1.4 * 1.333... )^3 ≈ (1.8667)^3≈ 6.504.

Wait, but earlier calculation: 1.8667^3≈6.504.

So a1 is about 6.5 times a2.

But we're interested in T_p1 / T_p2. Earlier, we found that T_p ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because T_p ~ sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

Since a1/a2 ≈6.5,

sqrt(a2/a1 )= 1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 1/2.55 ≈0.392.

So T_p1 / T_p2 ≈0.392.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.392. Let me check the options: the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.3, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

Hmm, 0.39 is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the a1/a2 ratio.

Wait, a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^3 * ( K2/K1 )^3.

M_p1=7, M_p2=5.

K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.905 km/s.

So K2/K1=1.905/1.428≈1.333.

So (7/5)^3= (1.4)^3=2.744.

(1.333)^3≈ (4/3)^3=64/27≈2.37.

Multiply 2.744 * 2.37 ≈6.504.

So a1/a2≈6.504.

Thus, a1 is 6.5 times a2. Then a2 is a1 /6.5.

Wait, no, a1 =6.5 a2.

So a1 =6.5 a2.

Thus, a2 =a1 /6.5.

So when we compute T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (a1/6.5)/a1 ) )= sqrt(1/6.5)≈0.392.

So T_p1 is about 0.392 times T_p2.

But the options don't have 0.392. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the proportionality backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, a1/a2 is ( M_p1^3 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

So a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )

Wait, 0.04/0.03 is 4/3, not 0.04/0.03=4/3.

Ah, no, that's correct. So (4/3)^3=64/27≈2.37.

(7/5)^3=343/125=2.744.

So 2.744 * 2.37 ≈6.504.

So a1 is 6.5 times a2.

But then the temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/6.5)=0.392.

Not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the way K relates to a.

Let me think again: from K = ( G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a (1-e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ) / c.

But for the purposes of ratios, perhaps it's better to write the ratio of the velocities, K1 and K2, and relate it to the cube roots of (M_p / ( a K )).

Wait, because K is proportional to ( M_p / ( a^(1/3) ) ), perhaps.

Wait, let's re-derive the formula correctly.

The formula for K is:

K = ( ( G * M_p * sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (2 pi a (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Assuming e=0 and sin i=1, and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So,

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 pi a ))^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me cube both sides:

K³ ≈ ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star ) * (1/(2 pi a )) ) / c³.

Then,

(2 pi a ) = ( G³ M_p³ ) / ( M_star K³ c³ ) * (1/(2 pi a ))^( -1 )

Wait, perhaps rearrange to solve for a:

(2 pi a ) = ( G³ M_p^3 ) / ( M_star K^3 c^3 )

Wait,

a = ( G³ M_p^3 ) / ( 2 pi M_star K^3 c^3 )

So, a ∝ ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 )

Because G, c, and pi are constants.

So the ratio a1/a2 is ( ( M_p1^3 ) / ( K1^3 ) ) / ( ( M_p2^3 ) / ( K2^3 ) ) ) = ( M_p1^3 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So a1/a2= (7^3 * (0.04)^3 ) / (5^3 * (0.03)^3 )

Wait, but 0.04 and 0.03 are the K values in units that we converted into m/s, so K1=1.428e3 m/s, K2=1.905e3 m/s.

Wait, no, actually, in the formula a ∝ ( M_p^3 / K^3 ), so the ratio a1/a2 is:

( (7^3 ) / (K1^3) ) / ( (5^3 ) / ( K2^3 ) ) ) = (7^3 * K2^3 ) / (5^3 * K1^3 )

So,

a1/a2= (343 * (1.905e3)^3 ) / (125 * (1.428e3)^3 )

But since the (1e3)^3 terms would be (1e9), but they cancel when taking the ratio.

So, a1/a2 = (343/125) * ( (1.905)/(1.428) )^3.

Compute 343/125=2.744.

Compute 1.905 /1.428 ≈1.333.

So,

a1/a2= 2.744 * (1.333)^3.

(1.333)^3= (4/3)^3=64/27≈2.37037.

So,

a1/a2= 2.744 * 2.37037≈6.504.

So same result as before.

So, a1=6.504 a2.

Then, the ratio T_p1 / T_p2 is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/6.504 )≈0.392.

But none of the options are near 0.39. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratios inverted. Because I might have confused a1 and a2 in the K relation.

Wait, in the earlier step: a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, a2 of Planet2.

Given that K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.905 km/s.

So, the ratio a1/a2= (7^3 * (0.04)^3 ) / (5^3 * (0.03)^3 ) ? No, that's not correct because we're using the actual K values, which are in m/s.

Wait, let me compute K1=1.428e3 m/s, K2=1.905e3 m/s.

So,

a1/a2= (7^3 * (K2)^3 ) / (5^3 * K1^3 )

= (343 * (1.905e3)^3 ) / (125 * (1.428e3)^3 )

= (343/125) * (1.905/1.428 )^3

Same as earlier.

So, same calculation, same result.

Hmm, so the temperature ratio is about 0.392. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the equilibrium temperature formula includes the square of the inverse of the distance, not the square root. Wait, let me recheck the formula.

Equilibrium temperature formula:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, earlier I thought it was sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

But wait, let me re-derive it.

The star's flux at the planet is F = L/(4 pi a²).

The planet absorbs F * (pi R_p²) * (1 - A) = F * sigma (absorbed energy).

The planet radiates as a blackbody: 4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Setting them equal:

F * pi R_p² (1 - A) = 4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Cancel R_p² and pi: F (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

F = L/(4 pi a² ), so:

(L/(4 pi a² )) (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

L is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So,

(4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 )/(4 pi a² ) * (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

Simplify:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 )/(a²) (1 - A) =4 sigma T_p^4.

Divide both sides by 4 sigma:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - A) )/(4 sigma a² ) )= T_p^4.

Take the fourth root:

T_p = T_star * ( R_star/(2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So yes, the formula is correct.

Thus, T_p is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So with a1=6.5 a2, T_p1 = T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5)≈0.392 T_p2.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the a ratio.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K was miscalculated. Let me think: perhaps K is proportional to ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) a^(1/3) )

So K = ( (G M_p )/( M_star ) )^(1/1) * (1/(a ))^(1/3 ) * (1/(c )) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. It's better to think in terms of the RV formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to relate the semi-major axis with the RV semi-amplitude:

The formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( 2 pi c ( M_star )^(2/3) (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) )

But since P is the period, which I don't have.

Wait, but without knowing P, perhaps we can relate K1 and K2 for the same star.

Alternatively, for the same star, the two planets have different K's.

But perhaps I can relate K1 and K2 to their respective periods and a.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that since K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3), then a is proportional to (M_p^3 )/( K^3 ), as before.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the Doppler shifts are given in Angstroms, and perhaps I should not convert them to velocities but use them directly in the formula as they are.

Wait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. So, perhaps I should not convert these shifts to velocities but use them in the formula. Because in the formula, K is in velocity units, but perhaps the ratio can be taken directly.

Wait, but the formula for a in terms of K uses K in velocity units. So to compute a correctly, perhaps I should convert the shifts to velocities.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K. Let me recompute the K's.

The forbidden line is at 6300 Å. Each planet causes a shift of 0.03 Å (Planet1) and 0.04 Å (Planet2).

The Doppler shift formula is v = c (Δλ / λ).

So for Planet1: v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 ). Similarly for Planet2: v2= c * (0.04 /6300 ).

Compute v1 and v2:

v1= (3e8 m/s) * (0.03 /6300) ) = 3e8 * (3e-3 /6.3e3 )= 3e8 * (4.76e-7)≈1.428e3 m/s.

v2=3e8 * (0.04/6300 )=3e8 * (4e-3/6.3e3 )=3e8 * (6.349e-7 )=1.905e3 m/s.

So K1=1.428e3 m/s, K2=1.905e3 m/s.

So earlier calculations are correct.

So a1/a2= (7^3 * (1.905e3)^3 ) / (5^3 * (1.428e3 )^3 ) )= (343/125) * (1.905/1.428)^3.

Which is (2.744) * (1.333)^3.

As before, 1.333^3≈2.370, so 2.744 *2.370≈6.504.

So a1=6.5 a2.

Thus, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5 )= T_p2 * 0.392.

So, the ratio T_p1/T_p2≈0.392, which is approximately 0.39. But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I confused the K values. Because the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. So in terms of velocity, K1=0.03/6300 *c, K2=0.04/6300 *c.

But in the a formula, a is proportional to (M_p^3 )/( K^3 ). So in our earlier calculation, K1=0.03/6300 *c, K2=0.04/6300 *c. But perhaps I should think in terms of their ratio, K1/K2= (0.03)/(0.04 )=3/4=0.75.

Wait, but in the a formula, a is proportional to ( M_p^3 )/( K^3 ), so a1/a2= ( M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) * ( K2^3 / M_p2^3 )

Which is ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (K2/K1 )^3 )

So,

a1/a2= (343/125) * (0.04/0.03 )^3= (2.744) * (4/3 )^3=2.744 * 64/27≈2.744*2.37≈6.504.

So same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature is given by T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Since (1 - A) is same for both, this term cancels in the ratio.

So T_p1/T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / ( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2/a1 )= 1/sqrt( a1/a2 )

We have a1/a2=6.504, so T_p1/T_p2=1/sqrt(6.504)≈0.392.

But the options are A:0.98, B:1.30, C:0.53, D:1.05.

Hmm, 0.392 isn't there. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the RV method's relation to the semi-major axis. Another way: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1/(2 pi a (1 -e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

But for M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Let me express this as K = ( G/(c) ) * ( M_p / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a ) )^(1/3) )

Cube both sides:

K³ = ( G³ / c³ ) * ( M_p³ ) / ( M_star ) ) * (1/(2 pi a ) )

Solve for a:

a = G³ M_p^3 / ( c³ K³ M_star 2 pi )

So a ∝ ( M_p^3 ) / ( K^3 M_star )

But in the ratio a1/a2, M_star cancels because same for both.

So,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) / ( M_p2^3 / K2^3 ) )= ( (7/5 )^3 ) * ( ( K2/K1 )^3 )

Which is same as earlier.

So, K2/K1=(0.04/0.03 ) * (c /c )=4/3.

So,

a1/a2= (7/5 )^3 * (4/3 )^3= (343/125 )*(64/27 )= (343 *64 )/(125 *27 )

Compute numerator:343 *64= 21952.

Denominator:125 *27=3375.

So,

a1/a2= 21952 /3375≈6.504.

Same result.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/6.504 )=0.392.

But the closest option is C) ~0.53, which is about 0.53.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature uses the star's flux as F = L/(4 pi a² ), and the planet's energy balance is F*(1 - A) = sigma T_p^4.

Wait, no, the correct equation is:

( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) = T_p^4.

Wait, let me re-derive it.

The star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

The planet intercepts a cross-sectional area of pi R_p^2, so the absorbed power is F * pi R_p^2 (1 - A ), where F is the flux at the planet's distance. F = L/(4 pi a² ).

So,

Power_absorbed = F * pi R_p² (1 - A )= (L/(4 pi a² )) * pi R_p² (1-A )= L R_p² (1-A )/(4 a² )

The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4 pi R_p², so Power_radiated=4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Setting them equal:

L R_p² (1-A )/(4 a² )=4 pi R_p² sigma T_p^4.

Cancel R_p²:

L (1 - A )/(4 a² )=4 pi sigma T_p^4.

L is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

Substitute:

(4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) (1 - A )/(4 a² )=4 pi sigma T_p^4.

Cancel 4 pi sigma on both sides:

R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A )/(a² )=4 T_p^4.

So,

T_p^4= ( R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A ) )/(4 a² )

Take fourth root:

T_p = T_star * ( R_star/(2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A ) )^(1/4 )

So, the formula is correct.

Hmm, so back to the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio a1/a2 correctly.

Wait, M_p1=7, M_p2=5.

K1=0.03/6300 *c, K2=0.04/6300 *c.

So, K1/K2=0.03/0.04=3/4.

Thus, K2/K1=4/3.

So,

a1/a2= ( (7/5 )^3 ) * ( (4/3 )^3 ) = (343/125 ) * (64/27 )= (343 *64 )/(125 *27 )= (21952 )/(3375 )≈6.504.

So, same as before.

So, the a ratio is correct.

Thus, T_p1 is about 0.392 T_p2.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the albedo. The problem states both planets have the same albedo, so that term cancels, which I accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up a1 and a2 in the temperature ratio.

Wait, T_p1 is for Planet1, which has a1=6.5 a2.

So, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5 )= T_p2 * 0.392.

So, T_p1 is cooler than T_p2.

Looking at the options, none are near 0.39. The closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's about 0.53, which is higher than 0.39.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K calculation. Let me recheck.

K1=0.03 Å / 6300 Å *c.

0.03/6300= 3e-3 /6.3e3= 3/(6.3e6)= approx 4.76e-7.

v1=4.76e-7 *3e8=1.428e3 m/s.

Similarly, K2=0.04/6300=4e-3/6.3e3=4/(6.3e6)=6.349e-7.

v2=6.349e-7 *3e8=1.905e3 m/s.

So calculations are correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps I made an error in cube calculation. Let me re-calculate (7/5 *4/3 )^3.

7/5=1.4, 4/3≈1.3333.

1.4 *1.3333=1.8666.

1.8666^3=?

Let me compute 1.8666^3:

1.8^3=5.832.

0.0666^3≈0.000296.

But using (a + b)^3 =a^3 +3a²b +3ab² +b^3.

a=1.8, b=0.0666.

a^3=5.832.

3a² b=3*(3.24)*(0.0666)=3*3.24=9.72 *0.0666≈0.647.

3a b²=3 *1.8 * (0.004435 )=5.4 *0.004435≈0.0239.

b^3≈0.000296.

Total≈5.832 +0.647=6.479 +0.0239=6.5029 +0.000296≈6.503.

So, 6.503. So a1/a2=6.503.

So, same as before.

Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option D), but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to swap the K values.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, which is smaller than Planet2's 0.04 Å. So K2>K1, implying a2 > a1? Because K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3).

Wait, because a is proportional to ( M_p^3 )/( K^3 ), so higher K means smaller a.

So, K2>K1 → a2 < a1.

Wait, let me think. For example, if K is larger, a is smaller.

So, Planet2 has a larger K (0.04) than Planet1 (0.03), which means a2 is smaller than a1.

So, a1 >a2.

So, the temperature ratio T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )= T_p2 * sqrt( 1/( a1/a2 ) )

But a1/a2=6.5, so T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt(1/6.5 )=0.392.

But the options don't have 0.392.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2.

Hmm, if T1=0.392 T2, then T1/T2=0.392.

But in the options, the closest is C) 0.53.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is a1/a2= (7/5 )^3 * (0.04/0.03 )^3= (343/125) * (64/27 )= (343*64)/(125*27 )= 21952/3375≈6.504.

Thus, a1=6.5 a2.

So, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2 /a1 )= sqrt(1/6.5 )= ~0.392.

So, the ratio is ~0.39.

But among the options, only C is less than 1, which is 0.53.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the equilibrium temperature should be inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, not the cube root.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. It's sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), which is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Thus, if a1=6.5 a2, then T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= T_p2 * 1/sqrt(6.5 )=0.392 T_p2.

So I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended option is C) 0.53.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio because I forgot to cube the K ratio.

Wait, K1=1.428e3, K2=1.905e3.

So, K2/K1=1.905/1.428=1.333.

So, (K2/K1 )^3=(4/3 )^3=64/27≈2.37.

Thus, a1/a2=(7/5 )^3 * (4/3 )^3= (343/125 ) * (64/27 )= (343 *64 )/(125 *27 )= 21952/3375≈6.504.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the cube and just multiply the ratios.

Wait, perhaps the formula for a is proportional to ( M_p / K )^3.

So, a1/a2= ( (7/(0.03) ) / (5/(0.04) ))^3.

Wait, that would be ( (7/5 ) * (0.04/0.03 ) )^3.

Which is same as earlier.

So same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the Doppler shifts in the same order.

If I swap K1 and K2, then a1/a2=(5^3 *0.04^3 )/(7^3 *0.03^3 ).

Which would be (125 * 64e-9 )/(343 *27e-9 )= (125 *64 )/(343 *27 )= (8000 )/(9261 )≈0.863.

So a1=0.863 a2.

Thus, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/0.863 )=sqrt(1.159)=≈1.076.

So, T_p1/T_p2≈1.076, which is close to option D)1.05.

But the problem states K1=0.03 and K2=0.04, so this would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to give K in the same order, but I'm not sure.

In conclusion, given the options, the correct answer based on the problem's data seems to be approximately 0.39, which isn't among the choices. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~1.05, but I can't see how that comes about with the given data.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for K is different. Let me think: perhaps the correct formula uses the cube root of the mass and some other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi a (1-e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

But this is the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the intended approach is to find the mass ratio and the Doppler shift ratio, and then find the inverse square root.

Wait, perhaps the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's mass.

Wait, no, the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis and the star's properties, not directly on the planet's mass.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV method, and then compute the equilibrium temperature ratio.

But given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the semi-major axis.

If K ∝ 1/a^(1/3), then a ∝ 1/K^3.

So, a1/a2= ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) * ( M_p1^3 / M_p2^3 )

Which is same as earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D) ~1.05.

Wait, let me compute 1/sqrt(6.5 )=0.392. So, if the ratio is 0.392, then the reciprocal is about 2.55.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the inverse ratio. Suppose T_p2 is sqrt( a1 / a2 ) ×T_star, then T_p2= sqrt(6.5 ) T_p1.

Thus, T_p1/T_p2=1/sqrt(6.5 )=0.392.

But the question asks for T_p1/T_p2, which is 0.392.

No option matches.

In conclusion, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~1.05, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct ratio is closer to 0.53.

Wait, 0.53 is roughly 1/sqrt(3.3 ). So if a1/a2=3.3, which would mean a1=3.3 a2.

But according to our calculation, a1/a2=6.5.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to switch the K values.

If K1=0.04 and K2=0.03, then:

a1/a2= (7^3 * (0.03)^3 )/(5^3 * (0.04)^3 ) )= (343/125 ) * (27/64 )= (2.744 )*(0.421875 )=1.156.

So a1/a2≈1.156.

Thus, T_p1= T_p2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )=1/sqrt(1.156 )=0.936.

But the options don't have this either.

I think I have to go with the calculated value, even if it's not an option. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the equilibrium temperature includes the planet's radius. But no, the formula is only dependent on the star's parameters and the planet's distance. The planet's radius affects the transit depth, not the equilibrium temperature.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * ( R_star/(2a) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ) / ( (1 + B)^(1/4 ) ), where B is the beaming factor. But I don't think so, as beaming is negligible for this level.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the planet's radius in the energy balance, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, the planet's radius cancels out in the energy balance equation. So it doesn't affect the temperature.

Hmm.

In conclusion, I think the correct ratio is approximately 0.39, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio as ( (M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 ) )^3.

Wait, a1/a2= ( M_p1^3 K2^3 )/( M_p2^3 K1^3 )

= ( (7*0.04 )/(5*0.03 ) )^3.

Wait, 7 *0.04=0.28; 5 *0.03=0.15.

So 0.28/0.15≈1.8667.

Cube of that is 6.504.

So same as before.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.39, which isn't listed. But perhaps the intended answer is option D) 1.05, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is T_p1/T_p2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/6.5 )=0.392≈0.4.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to have the same Doppler shifts, but that's not stated.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is not listed, but if I have to choose from the options, perhaps option C) ~0.53 is the closest, but I'm not confident.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_p = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{Planet1}}}{T_{\text{Planet2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{Planet2}}}{a_{\text{Planet1}}}}
\]

Thus, the temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes (\(a_{\text{Planet1}} / a_{\text{Planet2}}\)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Shifts
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging for \(a\), we find:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^3}{K^3}
\]

For the two planets, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{Planet1}}}{a_{\text{Planet2}}} = \frac{(M_{\text{Planet1}}^3 / K_{\text{Planet1}}^3)}{(M_{\text{Planet2}}^3 / K_{\text{Planet2}}^3)} = \left(\frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{K_{\text{Planet2}}}{K_{\text{Planet1}}}\right)^3
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
- \(M_{\text{Planet1}} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{\text{Planet2}} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_{\text{Planet1}} = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_{\text{Planet2}} = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

First, compute the mass ratio:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Next, compute the RV shift ratio:

\[
\frac{K_{\text{Planet2}}}{K_{\text{Planet1}}} = \frac{0.04}{0.03} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333
\]

Now, cube these ratios:

\[
\left(\frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}}\right)^3 = 1.4^3 = 2.744
\]
\[
\left(\frac{K_{\text{Planet2}}}{K_{\text{Planet1}}}\right)^3 = 1.333^3 \approx 2.37
\]

Finally, calculate the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{Planet1}}}{a_{\text{Planet2}}} = 2.744 \cdot 2.37 \approx 6.504
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio
Using the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{Planet1}}}{T_{\text{Planet2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{Planet2}}}{a_{\text{Planet1}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6.504}} \approx 0.392
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated temperature ratio (\(T_{\text{Planet1}} / T_{\text{Planet2}} \approx 0.392\)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) ~0.53**, which is approximately double the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from an error in the problem setup or assumptions.

### Final Answer
Given the available options, the best choice is:

**Answer: C**
