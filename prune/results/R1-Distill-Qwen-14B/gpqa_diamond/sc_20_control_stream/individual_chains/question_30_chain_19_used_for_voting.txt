Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry and light absorption. Hmm, let's think. The question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. And the question is, what color of light is absorbed by the compound.

Wait, I remember something about the energy of light and the colors. Oh right, different colors have different energies because they correspond to different wavelengths. The higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength. And I think the visible spectrum ranges from violet to red. Violet has the highest energy, then blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

But wait, the question is about absorption. Oh, right, when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits another when it goes back to a lower energy state. Or wait, no—excited electrons emit light when they drop back down. But the absorbed light is what excites them.

Wait, the compound emits light when electrons drop from a higher energy state to a lower one, right? Because when the electron gets excited, it's absorbing a photon, and then when it drops back, it emits a photon. So the emitted light's energy is what corresponds to the energy gap between the states.

So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color that corresponds to. But wait, wait. Sometimes the energy of emission relates to the energy difference between the states. So the energy of the photon emitted is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.

But the question is about what color is absorbed. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The compound is absorbing light, which causes the electrons to jump to a higher energy state. Then when they drop back, they emit light. So the energy of the absorbed photon is what's being used to excite the electron. So the energy of the emitted light would be lower than the absorbed, because some energy is lost as heat, maybe? Or perhaps in this context, it's assumed that the energy difference is the same as the emission.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the basics. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. The colors of the visible spectrum go from violet (highest energy) to red (lowest energy). So I need to figure out which color has energy around 2.34 eV.

Wait, I remember that the energy of visible light ranges approximately from about 1.8 eV to 3.0 eV. Let me recall the typical values. Violet is around 3 eV, blue around 2.5, green around 2.0, yellow around 1.8-2.1, orange lower, red lower than that.

Wait, no, maybe I have the numbers a bit off. Let me try to list approximate photon energies for each color:

- Violet: ~2.5-3 eV
- Blue: ~2.0-2.5 eV
- Green: ~1.8-2.2 eV
- Yellow: ~1.8-2.0 eV
- Orange: ~1.5-1.8 eV
- Red: ~1.2-1.8 eV

So 2.3393 eV would fall into the blue or maybe green range. Wait, more precisely, let's calculate the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV to see where it falls.

The formula is E(eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ(nm). So λ = 1240 / E. So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me compute that. 1240 divided by 2.3393.

Hmm, 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 is about 529.8 nm. Wait, 530 nm. So what color is 530 nm? I think green is around 500-570 nm, so 530 is in the green range. Wait, but sometimes the colors overlap.

Wait, but wait, the question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So the emitted light is green. But the question is about the color absorbed. Oh! Because when a molecule absorbs light, it's at the complementary color. Wait, no, not necessarily. Or maybe the absorbed light is higher energy than the emitted? I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, let me think again. The process is: the molecule absorbs a photon (energy E_absorbed) which causes an electron to jump to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back down, it emits a photon (energy E_emitted). So E_absorbed is the energy of the absorbed light, which is higher than E_emitted? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. When the electron is promoted from a lower energy level to a higher one, the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to that transition. Then, when the electron drops back, it emits a photon with energy E_emission. But unless the molecule is in a different environment or some energy is lost (like as heat), E_absorbed and E_emitted would be the same. But in reality, some energy might be lost, so E_emitted is less than or equal to E_absorbed.

Wait, but in some cases, like in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one. Because the molecule might lose some energy as heat during the transition. So if the emitted energy is 2.34 eV, then the absorbed energy must be either higher or equal. But wait, in this question, what is the exact scenario?

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy absorbed must be at least that. But the options are colors, not energies.

Wait, but the question is, what color is absorbed? So the absorbed light has the energy corresponding to the transition. So the absorbed photon energy is equal to the energy difference between the electronic states. So if the molecule is emitting at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be that same? Or is it different?

Wait, that's confusing. Let's think: when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from a lower to higher energy level. Then, when that electron relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the initial and excited states. Unless there's some other factor, like multiple transitions or other energy losses.

But in this case, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. Or maybe the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed one.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed. So the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the wavelength: 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is in the green range. So the emitted light is green. But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the emitted light is green, that's because the molecule's electron transition involved a drop that emits green. Which means the absorbed light was higher energy, perhaps blue? Or maybe it's the same as the emission.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, no, the energy of the emitted photon is from the transition, so the energy of that photon is the difference between the excited and ground states. So the energy of the absorbed photon should be the same as the energy of the transition. So if the emission is at 2.34 eV, the absorption would be at the same energy. So the absorbed light is the same as the emitted.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule can't absorb and emit the same energy at the same time. Or can it? Wait, but in the case of fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon and emits a lower energy one. So the absorption is at a higher energy, the emission lower.

So in our problem, the emission is at 2.34 eV. So the absorption must be at a higher energy. So the question is, which color is higher in energy than 2.34 eV. The colors in order of energy: violet (highest) > blue > green > yellow > orange > red (lowest).

So 2.34 eV is approximately green (around 530 nm). So the absorbed photon must be higher energy than 2.34 eV. So the next color higher than green is blue. Wait, blue is about 2.5-3 eV. So if the emitted photon is 2.34 eV, the absorbed photon would be blue, which is higher. So the color absorbed is blue.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. The energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = hc/λ_abs. The energy of emitted photon is E_emit = hc/λ_emit.

But the energy absorbed is the energy of the transition. So E_abs = E_emit, because when the electron absorbs the photon, it gains energy E_abs, then when it emits, it loses that same energy.

Wait, but wait, that's only the case if the molecule doesn't lose any energy during the transition. But in reality, sometimes the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or through other mechanisms. So if the dye emits at 2.34 eV, then the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So looking at the options, the colors with energy higher than 2.34 eV are violet and blue. Because blue is about 2.5-3 eV. So if the emission is 2.34 eV, what color is absorbed? It would be a higher energy, so blue or violet.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So if the emitted energy is 2.34 eV (green), the absorbed energy would be a higher color. So it's either blue or violet. But which one?

Wait, maybe I can compute the exact wavelength. E = 2.3393 eV. So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. 530 nm is in the green range (since green is roughly 495-570 nm), so the emitted light is green. So the molecule must have absorbed a photon of higher energy than green. So the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But the question is asking, which color is absorbed? Let me see the options. Option C is blue, option B is violet.

Wait, but another approach is that the color emitted is the complementary color of the absorbed. Wait, no, I'm not sure. The complementary color is what allows the object to appear the color it does, but that's in the context of color mixing, not absorption.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which excites an electron from a lower to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back, it emits a photon of energy E_emit. So E_abs would be the energy of the transition, which is the same as E_emit (assuming no energy loss).

Wait, but wait, no. If the molecule goes from ground state to excited state by absorbing a photon, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the two states. So the energy of the emitted photon would be the same as the absorbed photon. But in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy. So that suggests that during the transition, some energy is lost, so E_emit < E_abs.

So in this case, the emitted photon is E_emit = 2.3393 eV. That means the absorbed photon must have higher energy (E_abs > E_emit), because some energy is lost as heat or other forms.

So E_abs > 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted one.

So to find out what color that is, I need to find which color has energy higher than 2.34 eV.

Looking at the options, violet is higher than blue, which is higher than green, which is higher than yellow, etc.

So which color has energy higher than 2.34 eV? Let's see:

- Violet: let's say 3 eV (high end is about 3.1 eV)
- Blue: let's say 2.5 eV (lower end is about 2.0 eV)
So 2.34 eV is in between blue and green.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the exact values. The energy of blue is around 2.5 eV. So 2.34 is near the lower end of blue. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so it's blue. No, wait, 2.34 is lower than 2.5, so it's in the blue? Hmm.

Wait, no. Because 2.34 is less than 2.5, so it's lower energy than blue. So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy than 2.34 eV. So the color absorbed is blue or violet.

Wait, but blue is 2.5 to around 3 eV. So 2.34 is below that, so the absorbed photon is blue. Because blue is higher than 2.34 eV.

Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think in terms of wavelength.

The higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength. So violet has the shortest wavelength in visible light, around 380 nm. Blue is around 450 nm, green around 500, etc.

So E = 1240 / λ.

Violet at 400 nm: E = 1240 /400 = 3.1 eV.

Blue at 450 nm: E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

Green at 500 nm: E ≈ 2.48 eV.

So 2.34 eV is just below green's typical energy. Wait, wait. 1240 / 530 ≈ 2.34. So 530 nm is green. So what color has energy higher than 2.34 eV? The colors with wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

So colors with λ <530 nm. So blue (450 nm) is higher energy than green (530). Violet is even higher.

So the absorbed photon must have a wavelength less than 530 nm, meaning higher energy than 2.34 eV. So the color absorbed is either violet or blue.

Now, looking at the options, option C is blue, option B is violet. Which one is it?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. The emission is at 2.34 eV, so the absorption must be at a higher energy, so the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But which one? If the emission is green, the absorption would be blue or violet. So the question is, what's the color of the absorbed light.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So between B and C.

Wait, I think that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon is blue (2.5-3 eV), so the emission is lower energy (green).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the absorption is in the same region as the emission, but that doesn't make sense because the light emitted is the result of the electron transition. So the absorbed light must be higher in energy.

So, in that case, the color absorbed is blue. Because blue is higher than green.

But wait, 2.34 is just under the typical blue range. For example, blue starts around 2.5 eV. So if the absorption is at 2.5 eV, that's blue.

Wait, but 2.34 eV is in the green, but I thought the emission is green, so the absorption is higher than that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule has an extensive conjugated pi system. That means the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO is smaller than in isolated double bonds. So the molecule would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light compared to a smaller conjugated system.

Wait, but wait, wait. Extensive conjugation leads to a smaller energy gap, so the molecule absorbs at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So the absorption would be in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum. Wait, but that's for the absorption. Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed, so that would be lower energy (longer wavelength, like red or orange) if the conjugation is extensive.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me clarify.

In conjugated systems, the extent of conjugation affects the wavelength of light absorbed. More conjugation leads to a smaller energy gap between HOMO and LUMO, so the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, it would absorb in the red or near-infrared region.

So if the molecule emits green light, which is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than red, but in reality, the absorbed light is the one that's lower in energy because of the extensive conjugation.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO determines the wavelength absorbed. A larger energy gap requires higher energy (shorter wavelength) light to be absorbed. So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, the energy gap is smaller, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light, like red.

Wait, but the emission is 2.34 eV, which is green. So the molecule has a transition that emits green. Which would mean that the energy gap is 2.34 eV. So the absorbed photon must have that same energy, but wait, no. Wait, if the molecule emits at that energy, it's because the electron transition involves that energy change. So the absorption must be at the same energy. But wait, that can't be right because a molecule can't absorb and emit the same photon without some loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorption is at higher energy, and the emission is at lower energy. So the molecule absorbs blue (higher energy) and emits green (lower energy).

Wait, but if the molecule is extensively conjugated, it should absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum, right?

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. The question is, the compound emits light of a certain energy. What color is it absorbing?

Wait, the color emitted is green (since 2.34 eV corresponds to 530 nm, which is green). The color absorbed would be the one that corresponds to the energy gap. So if the molecule is emitting green, the transition that caused the emission was green.

But when a molecule absorbs light, it uses that energy to promote electrons. The electron then drops back, emitting a photon. So the absorbed photon's energy is the same as the energy difference between the states.

Wait, but that would mean that the absorption is at the same energy as the emission. But then the molecule would absorb and emit the same color, which isn't possible because it's in the same place.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the energy levels. Suppose the molecule has an electron in the ground state (lower energy) and an excited state (higher energy). The energy difference is E. When the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, the electron jumps to the excited state. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon of energy E. So the absorption and emission are at the same energy. But in practice, sometimes the emission is at lower energy because some energy is lost, like through vibrations or other transitions.

But in this problem, the emitted energy is given. So if the molecule emits at 2.34 eV, what's the absorption? It's possible that the absorption is at a higher energy. So the color absorbed is blue, which is higher than green.

Wait, but if the molecule is extensively conjugated, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorption would be at a lower energy (longer wavelength). But wait, the emission is at 2.34 eV, which is higher than the absorption. Because when the molecule emits, the photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs. This excites an electron from a lower to higher energy state.

2. The electron then relaxes, emitting a photon of energy E_emit.

3. E_abs is typically greater than or equal to E_emit because some energy is lost as heat or other forms.

4. If the molecule emits at 2.34 eV, then E_emit = 2.34 eV. So E_abs must be >= 2.34 eV.

5. The question asks what color is absorbed. The options are: red, violet, blue, yellow.

6. Which color has energy >= 2.34 eV?

   Violet: around 3 eV (higher than 2.34)

   Blue: around 2.5-3 eV (so some blues are higher, some lower)

   So if the absorption is at 2.34 eV, the color would be green. But that's not an option.

Wait, but 2.34 is in the green, but the options don't have green. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So 2.34 eV is in the green, but the options don't include it. So perhaps I need to find the color whose energy is higher than 2.34 eV, because the absorbed photon is higher.

So which color is higher than 2.34 eV? Violet and Blue.

Because Violet is higher than blue, but 2.34 is about in the middle of blue's energy range.

Wait, blue's energy is about 2.5 eV, which is higher than 2.34. So if the molecule emits green (2.34), the absorption must be higher, so blue or violet.

But among the options, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the absorption is in the blue region. So the color absorbed is blue.

So the answer is C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of emitted light and the energy of absorbed light. The compound emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm**. This wavelength falls within the green region of the visible spectrum.

The energy of the emitted photon is related to the energy gap between the electronic states of the molecule. When an electron is excited to a higher energy state, the molecule absorbs a photon of energy equal to or greater than this gap. Upon relaxation, the electron emits a photon of energy corresponding to the gap. However, in many cases, some energy is lost as heat or other forms of energy during the transition, so the emitted photon typically has lower energy than the absorbed photon.

Given that the emitted photon energy is **2.3393 eV (green)**, the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Among the options provided:

- **Red (1.8–2.0 eV)**: Too low in energy.
- **Violet (3.0–3.1 eV)**: Slightly higher than 2.34 eV but less common for absorption in this context.
- **Blue (2.5–3.0 eV)**: Higher than 2.34 eV and a reasonable choice.
- **Yellow (1.8–2.2 eV)**: Too low in energy.

Since blue light has energy in the range of **2.5–3.0 eV**, it is higher than the emitted energy of **2.34 eV**. Therefore, the compound absorbs blue light.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry and light absorption. Hmm, let's think. The question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. And the question is, what color of light is absorbed by the compound.

- Red: ~1.2-1.8 eV

So 2.3393 eV would fall into the blue or maybe green range. Wait, more precisely, let's calculate the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV to see where it falls.

The formula is E(eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ(nm). So λ = 1240 / E. So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me compute that. 1240 divided by 2.3393.

Hmm, 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 is about 529.8 nm. Wait, 530 nm. So what color is 530 nm? I think green is around 500-570 nm, so 530 is in the green range. Wait, but sometimes the colors overlap.

So if the emitted energy is 2.34 eV (green), the absorbed energy would be a higher color. So it's either blue or violet. But which one?

Wait, maybe I can compute the exact wavelength. E = 2.3393 eV. So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. 530 nm is in the green range (since green is roughly 495-570 nm), so the emitted light is green. So the molecule must have absorbed a photon of higher energy than green. So the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But the question is asking, which color is absorbed? Let me see the options. Option C is blue, option B is violet.

Wait, but another approach is that the color emitted is the complementary color of the absorbed. Wait, no, I'm not sure. The complementary color is what allows the object to appear the color it does, but that's in the context of color mixing, not absorption.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which excites an electron from a lower to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back, it emits a photon of energy E_emit. So E_abs would be the energy of the transition, which is the same as E_emit (assuming no energy loss).

Wait, but wait, no. If the molecule goes from ground state to excited state by absorbing a photon, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the two states. So the energy of the emitted photon would be the same as the absorbed photon. But in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy. So that suggests that during the transition, some energy is lost, so E_emit < E_abs.

So in this case, the emitted photon is E_emit = 2.3393 eV. That means the absorbed photon must have higher energy (E_abs > E_emit), because some energy is lost as heat or other forms.

So E_abs > 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted one.

So to find out what color that is, I need to find which color has energy higher than 2.34 eV.

Looking at the options, violet is higher than blue, which is higher than green, which is higher than yellow, etc.

So which color has energy higher than 2.34 eV? Let's see:

- Violet: let's say 3 eV (high end is about 3.1 eV)
- Blue: let's say 2.5 eV (lower end is about 2.0 eV)
So 2.34 eV is in between blue and green.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the exact values. The energy of blue is around 2.5 eV. So 2.34 is near the lower end of blue. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so it's blue. No, wait, 2.34 is lower than 2.5, so it's in the blue? Hmm.

Wait, no. Because 2.34 is less than 2.5, so it's lower energy than blue. So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy than 2.34 eV. So the color absorbed is blue or violet.

Wait, but blue is 2.5 to around 3 eV. So 2.34 is below that, so the absorbed photon is blue. Because blue is higher than 2.34 eV.

Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think in terms of wavelength.

The higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength. So violet has the shortest wavelength in visible light, around 380 nm. Blue is around 450 nm, green around 500, etc.

So E = 1240 / λ.

Violet at 400 nm: E = 1240 /400 = 3.1 eV.

Blue at 450 nm: E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

Green at 500 nm: E ≈ 2.48 eV.

So 2.34 eV is just below green's typical energy. Wait, wait. 1240 / 530 ≈ 2.34. So 530 nm is green. So what color has energy higher than 2.34 eV? The colors with wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

So colors with λ <530 nm. So blue (450 nm) is higher energy than green (530). Violet is even higher.

So the absorbed photon must have a wavelength less than 530 nm, meaning higher energy than 2.34 eV. So the color absorbed is either violet or blue.

Now, looking at the options, option C is blue, option B is violet. Which one is it?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. The emission is at 2.34 eV, so the absorption must be at a higher energy, so the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But which one? If the emission is green, the absorption would be blue or violet. So the question is, what's the color of the absorbed light.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So between B and C.

Wait, I think that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon is blue (2.5-3 eV), so the emission is lower energy (green).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the absorption is in the same region as the emission, but that doesn't make sense because the light emitted is the result of the electron transition. So the absorbed light must be higher in energy.

So, in that case, the color absorbed is blue. Because blue is higher than green.

But wait, 2.34 is just under the typical blue range. For example, blue starts around 2.5 eV. So if the absorption is at 2.5 eV, that's blue.

Wait, but 2.34 eV is in the green, but I thought the emission is green, so the absorption is higher than that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule has an extensive conjugated pi system. That means the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO is smaller than in isolated double bonds. So the molecule would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light compared to a smaller conjugated system.

Wait, but wait, wait. Extensive conjugation leads to a smaller energy gap, so the molecule absorbs at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So the absorption would be in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum. Wait, but that's for the absorption. Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed, so that would be lower energy (longer wavelength, like red or orange) if the conjugation is extensive.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me clarify.

In conjugated systems, the extent of conjugation affects the wavelength of light absorbed. More conjugation leads to a smaller energy gap between HOMO and LUMO, so the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, it would absorb in the red or near-infrared region.

So if the molecule emits green light, which is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than red, but in reality, the absorbed light is the one that's lower in energy because of the extensive conjugation.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO determines the wavelength absorbed. A larger energy gap requires higher energy (shorter wavelength) light to be absorbed. So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, the energy gap is smaller, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light, like red.

Wait, but the emission is 2.34 eV, which is green. So the molecule has a transition that emits green. Which would mean that the energy gap is 2.34 eV. So the absorbed photon must have that same energy, but wait, no. Wait, if the molecule emits at that energy, it's because the electron transition involves that energy change. So the absorption must be at the same energy. But wait, that can't be right because a molecule can't absorb and emit the same photon without some loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorption is at higher energy, and the emission is at lower energy. So the molecule absorbs blue (higher energy) and emits green (lower energy).

Wait, but if the molecule is extensively conjugated, it should absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum, right?

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. The question is, the compound emits light of a certain energy. What color is it absorbing?

Wait, the color emitted is green (since 2.34 eV corresponds to 530 nm, which is green). The color absorbed would be the one that corresponds to the energy gap. So if the molecule is emitting green, the transition that caused the emission was green.

But when a molecule absorbs light, it uses that energy to promote electrons. The electron then drops back, emitting a photon. So the absorbed photon's energy is the same as the energy difference between the states.

Wait, but that would mean that the absorption is at the same energy as the emission. But then the molecule would absorb and emit the same color, which isn't possible because it's in the same place.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the energy levels. Suppose the molecule has an electron in the ground state (lower energy) and an excited state (higher energy). The energy difference is E. When the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, the electron jumps to the excited state. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon of energy E. So the absorption and emission are at the same energy. But in practice, sometimes the emission is at lower energy because some energy is lost, like through vibrations or other transitions.

But in this problem, the emitted energy is given. So if the molecule emits at 2.34 eV, what's the absorption? It's possible that the absorption is at a higher energy. So the color absorbed is blue, which is higher than green.

Wait, but if the molecule is extensively conjugated, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorption would be at a lower energy (longer wavelength). But wait, the emission is at 2.34 eV, which is higher than the absorption. Because when the molecule emits, the photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs. This excites an electron from a lower to higher energy state.

2. The electron then relaxes, emitting a photon of energy E_emit.

3. E_abs is typically greater than or equal to E_emit because some energy is lost as heat or other forms.

4. If the molecule emits at 2.34 eV, then E_emit = 2.34 eV. So E_abs must be >= 2.34 eV.

5. The question asks what color is absorbed. The options are: red, violet, blue, yellow.

6. Which color has energy >= 2.34 eV?

   Violet: around 3 eV (higher than 2.34)

   Blue: around 2.5-3 eV (so some blues are higher, some lower)

   So if the absorption is at 2.34 eV, the color would be green. But that's not an option.

Wait, but 2.34 is in the green, but the options don't have green. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So 2.34 eV is in the green, but the options don't include it. So perhaps I need to find the color whose energy is higher than 2.34 eV, because the absorbed photon is higher.

So which color is higher than 2.34 eV? Violet and Blue.

Because Violet is higher than blue, but 2.34 is about in the middle of blue's energy range.

Wait, blue's energy is about 2.5 eV, which is higher than 2.34. So if the molecule emits green (2.34), the absorption must be higher, so blue or violet.

But among the options, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the absorption is in the blue region. So the color absorbed is blue.

So the answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of emitted light and the energy of absorbed light. The compound emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm**. This wavelength falls within the green region of the visible spectrum.

The energy of the emitted photon is related to the energy gap between the electronic states of the molecule. When an electron is excited to a higher energy state, the molecule absorbs a photon of energy equal to or greater than this gap. Upon relaxation, the electron emits a photon of energy corresponding to the gap. However, in many cases, some energy is lost as heat or other forms of energy during the transition, so the emitted photon typically has lower energy than the absorbed photon.

Given that the emitted photon energy is **2.3393 eV (green)**, the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Among the options provided:

- **Red (1.8–2.0 eV)**: Too low in energy.
- **Violet (3.0–3.1 eV)**: Slightly higher than 2.34 eV but less common for absorption in this context.
- **Blue (2.5–3.0 eV)**: Higher than 2.34 eV and a reasonable choice.
- **Yellow (1.8–2.2 eV)**: Too low in energy.

Since blue light has energy in the range of **2.5–3.0 eV**, it is higher than the emitted energy of **2.34 eV**. Therefore, the compound absorbs blue light.

Answer: C
