Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?

The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific transition in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet range, right? So wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is about 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far UV, I think.

Wait, the question is about detecting these clouds using optical telescopes. But optical telescopes can't see UV light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, if the Lyman alpha emission is in UV, then for this emission to be observed in optical wavelengths, the source must be redshifted so that the wavelength shifts into the optical range.

So the idea here is that when the quasar's light is redshifted, the Lyman alpha absorption line moves into a wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. Otherwise, if the redshift is too low, the Lyman alpha would still be in UV and not observable from the ground.

So the redshift z is given by z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1.

We need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. What's the lower limit of optical? I think optical wavelengths start around 400 nanometers (violet) up to about 700 nm (red). So the smallest observed wavelength we can detect is about 400 nm.

So let me plug in the numbers. The rest wavelength λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. Observed wavelength λ_obs has to be at least 400 nm for optical telescopes.

So z = (400 nm) / (121.6 nm) - 1.

Calculating that: 400 / 121.6 is approximately 3.29. So 3.29 - 1 = 2.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So if z is 2.29, that's the minimum redshift needed to bring the Lyman alpha into optical. Any lower z would leave the observed wavelength below 400 nm, which is UV and not detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.4 and D)1.9. Wait, 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So if the redshift is just enough to make the wavelength 400 nm, that's the minimum. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any object with z >= 2.29 would have Lyman alpha in the optical.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum redshift at which the Lyman alpha can be observed in optical is z=2.29. So anything below that would not be observable. So the lower limit is z around 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is slightly higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower.

But wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 121.6 nm is 1216 Angstroms. Optical wavelengths are from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if the observed wavelength is 400 nm, that's the lower limit of optical.

So z = (400 / 121.6) -1.

400 divided by 121.6: Let's compute this accurately.

400 / 121.6 = 400 ÷ 121.6 ≈ 3.2908. So z ≈ 2.2908.

So the minimum redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C (2.4). But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that the objects can be detected. So anything above that redshift would be detectable. So the lower limit is z=2.29, which is about 2.3. So any object with z >=2.29 would have Lyman alpha in optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, meaning the redshift must be at least that. So the minimum needed is 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but if the options don't have 2.3, the closest lower option would be D)1.9, but that's lower than 2.29. Hmm, I think I made a mistake because option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it would not satisfy the condition.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the observed wavelength can't be too far into the optical. Wait no, the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z required. So the minimal z is 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So if you have a redshift higher than 2.29, you can detect it. So the lower limit on the redshift for detection is 2.29. So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the objects must have z >=2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, meaning the minimal redshift is 2.29.

But the options don't have 2.29. The options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9.

The closest is option C (2.4) which is higher than 2.29. So the answer would be 2.4 as the lower limit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating; maybe the question is about when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical, which is at z=2.29. So any object with a redshift higher than that would have the line in the optical, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3. So the correct answer would be the option just above that.

Looking at the options, the available options are 1.9, 2.4, etc. So the correct answer would be 2.4 (option C) as the lower limit. Or wait, maybe the reasoning is that the Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms. So if the observed wavelength is longer than that (due to redshift), then the observed wavelength must be in the optical.

Wait, but in reality, the quasars are at high redshifts. When their light is redshifted, the Lyman alpha line shifts. But if the quasar itself is too low redshift, then the Lyman alpha absorption would be in the UV, which is not observable from the ground.

So the formula is z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

The minimal λ_obs is 400 nm (since beyond that into the UV is not detectable by ground optical telescopes).

So z = (400 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 = (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any object with a redshift greater than or equal to 2.29 can be detected.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3. So the answer would be option C)2.4.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but when it's emitted, it's in the UV. But if the quasar is at a certain redshift, the Lyman alpha line could be redshifted into the visible range. So for the line to be in the visible (say, 400 nm), the redshift needs to be about 2.29, as I calculated.

But why is option B 1.2? Let's see: z=1.2 would give observed wavelength 121.6*(1+1.2) = 121.6 *2.2 = 267.52 nm. That's still in the UV, so not detectable by optical telescopes. So z=1.2 is too low.

If z=1.9, then observed λ is 121.6*(2.9) = 352.64 nm, which is still in the near UV. So some ground-based telescopes might have UV capability, but generally, optical telescopes can't see that. So z=1.9 is still too low. At z=2.4, the wavelength is 121.6*(3.4)=413.44 nm, which is in the violet part of the optical spectrum. So that's detectable.

So the minimal redshift is around 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The closest option is C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift at which large clouds of neutral hydrogen can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift of the Lyman alpha absorption line. The rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is approximately 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which lies in the ultraviolet (UV) range. For this line to be observed in the optical range, it must be redshifted into wavelengths detectable by optical telescopes, typically starting around 400 nm.

The redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Here, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \) (the lower limit of the optical range). Substituting these values:

\[
z = \frac{400}{121.6} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift required to bring the Lyman alpha line into the optical range is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Any object with a redshift greater than or equal to this value will have its Lyman alpha line detectable in the optical range. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (3):** This is higher than the calculated minimum redshift of 2.29 and is valid but not the closest lower limit.
- **Option B (1.2):** At \( z = 1.2 \), the observed wavelength is \( 121.6 \times (1 + 1.2) = 267.52 \, \text{nm} \), still in the UV and undetectable by optical telescopes.
- **Option C (2.4):** This is slightly higher than the calculated minimum redshift of 2.29 and represents the closest available option.
- **Option D (1.9):** At \( z = 1.9 \), the observed wavelength is \( 121.6 \times (1 + 1.9) = 352.64 \, \text{nm} \), still in the UV and undetectable by optical telescopes.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C (2.4)**.
