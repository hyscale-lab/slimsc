Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and B. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Hmm, same number of n and p... So that's probably something like H2O or NH3, but wait, wait. Let me think. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but maybe another molecule. Oh, wait, what about CO2? No, that has 12 C and 16 O. Wait, no, wait. The number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. So for each molecule, each atom's n and p count? Or the molecule as a whole? Oh, probably the molecule as a whole. So the total number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the entire molecule.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let's think of some possible candidates. For example, H2O: H has 1p each, O has 8p. So H2O has 2+8=10 protons, and the neutrons would be from each atom. H is usually ^1H, so 0 neutrons each. O is ^16O, which has 8 neutrons. So total neutrons: 0*2 + 8 =8. Protons: 10. Not equal. So not H2O.

What about CH4? C has 6 p, each H has 1. So total p=6+4=10. Neutrons: C is ^12C (6n), H has 0. So total n=6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe another molecule. Let's think of CO (carbon monoxide). C has 6p, O has 8p. Total p=14. Neutrons: C is 6n, O is 8n (if ^16O), so 14n. Oh, wait, 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So CO would fit. Because 6+8=14 protons, and 6 (from C) +8 (from O)=14 neutrons.

Alternatively, maybe something else. If it's a diatomic molecule, like O2. O has 8p each, so O2 has 16 p. Neutrons: each O-16 has 8n, so 16n. So 16p and 16n. So O2 fits too. But the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So CO and O2 are possibilities. But I'm not sure yet.

The reaction produces a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B is probably a solid at room temperature. Wait, melting point about 4°C. Hmm, that's a bit low. What substances have that melting point? Maybe something like water? No, water melts at 0°C. Wait, maybe something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is ammonium chloride? No, I don't know its melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is some kind of metal, but most metals have higher melting points. Wait, another angle: when G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is some carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B and CO2. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, heating would release CO2 and leave CaO. But CaO has a melting point around 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach. The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So, the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has four O atoms. When it reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid, but that's not adding any O. Wait, maybe the reaction is an esterification or something else. Alternatively, maybe X is an oxidizing agent or a reducing agent?

Wait, what's the first part of the problem again? Substance X is known for having a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is something like H2O, but with a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Wait, no, H2O has H and O. If the heavier isotope is O-18, for example.

But X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's a heavy isotope. Wait, what reagents are common in organic chemistry? Maybe something like D2O, which is heavy water. Because H has isotopes, and D (deuterium) is a heavier isotope. So X could be D2O. But wait, in that case, the reaction of D2O with a liquid Y would produce what? Let's think.

If X is D2O, then reacting with Y (maybe an acid or a base). Wait, what's Y? Let's think about the reaction. D2O + Y → gas W, precipitate G, and B.

Wait, another approach: when X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, the products are gas W (with same n and p), precipitate G, and B.

If X is D2O, and Y is something like Na, then maybe the reaction is Na + D2O → NaOD + H2D2? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Let's think about another angle.

Wait, the precipitate G when heated releases B. So when G is heated, it decomposes into B and possibly gas W. So maybe G is a carbonate, which upon heating releases CO2 and leaves a metal oxide. But earlier thoughts about the melting point didn't fit. Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide that decomposes. For example, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating might produce a metal oxide and water, but that doesn't fit with the gas W being a product. Hmm.

Wait, maybe G is a bicarbonate. For instance, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) when heated decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But that would release CO2 gas, which is a possibility for W.

If W is CO2, then its molecule would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 12+32=44 g/mol. Now, the number of protons and neutrons in CO2: C has 6p and 6n (if ^12C), O has 8p and 8n (if ^16O). So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 =22. So yes, same number. So CO2 fits as W.

If W is CO2, then the reaction could be something like a carbonate decomposing.

So perhaps Y is an acid. Let me think: if X is D2O (heavy water), and Y is a carbonate, then X and Y would react? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is a base. Let's say X is NaOH (but then D2O isn't a base). Wait, perhaps X is a heavy isotope-containing compound. For example, if X is CDCl3 (chloroform with deuterium), but that's not a base.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy water isotope, but perhaps it's Cl isotopes. Wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X could be something like Cl- with a heavier isotope (like ^37Cl), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction where X is a heavy isotope of a halogen. Let's think of a possible reaction. Suppose X is CHCl3 with a heavier Cl isotope. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K (~4°C). So B is a solid at that temperature. What's a solid with a melting point near 4°C? Maybe ammonium nitrate? No, its melting point is higher. Wait, what about something like NaNO3? No, that's way higher. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So, suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH, which has four O atoms). When it reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. So maybe X is something that removes two oxygens. Or perhaps X is a reducing agent that reduces the acid.

Wait, if the keto acid is being deoxygenated, perhaps X is a strong reductant. For example, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the question says that the product has two O atoms. So, if the starting material is a keto acid (say, RCOOH), and the product is something like RCH2OH (a primary alcohol), which has one O. Wait, but that would reduce the O count from two (in the acid, RCOOH has two O in the COOH group) to one in the alcohol. Hmm, but the product has two O atoms. So maybe the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is reacting in a way that adds an oxygen. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, but that might not add O.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. If the keto acid is, say, RCOOH and it reacts with an alcohol to form an ester (RCOOR'), which has an O in the ester group. But that would add O, not reduce. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is decarboxylation, where the COOH group is removed, but that leaves behind a compound with fewer O's. For example, if the acid is RCOOH, decarboxylation would give R (with a loss of CO2). But then the product might have fewer O's, but the product here has two O atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, a keto acid could undergo oxidation to a ketone? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe X is something like PCl5 or another chlorinating agent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is reacting with X in a way that forms an acetal or something. But that typically involves alcohols. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress on that front. Let's go back to the earlier points. If W is CO2, then the reaction could involve carbonate decomposition. So perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. But wait, the question says X reacts with Y, so maybe X is the acid.

Wait, if X is an acid like HCl, but with a heavier isotope. But then, HCl with a heavier H (deuterium) would be HDCl. Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O, and Y is a carbonate. Then the reaction could be D2O + Na2CO3 → NaCO3D2 (but I'm not sure about that; maybe it's more like the acid-base reaction).

Wait, but if X is D2O and Y is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO3^2- and H2O or something. But that might not fit with the gas being CO2.

Alternatively, maybe X is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like D2O, and Y is an acid. Then, X and Y would react to produce a salt and water. But if Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then reacting with D2O would produce NaCO3D2 (not sure about the formula) and perhaps release CO2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a strong acid. Then, X + Y → salt + CO2 + H2O. But that would fit. So if X is an acid, then when it reacts with a carbonate, it produces CO2 gas, which would be W. So W is CO2.

So if W is CO2, then X is an acid, perhaps HCl or another acid, with a heavier isotope. Let's say X is HCl with a heavier Cl isotope, like ^37Cl. Or perhaps X is an acid that has a heavier isotope in another element, like O with ^18O.

But then, the precipitate G would be the salt formed from the acid and carbonate. For example, when HCl reacts with Na2CO3, it produces NaCl, CO2, and H2O. So G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. Hmm, not a precipitate. So maybe Y is not a carbonate but something else. Wait, if Y is a hydroxide, then the reaction could produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, if Y is a sulfide. Suppose Y is ZnS. Then, X (an acid) would react with Y to produce H2S gas, a metal sulfide salt, and perhaps a precipitate. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of the keto acid with X has two O atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), which has two O's in the COOH group. If it reacts with X to form a product with two O's, perhaps X is a reducing agent that reduces the acid. For example, LiAlH4 reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols. So HCOOH + LiAlH4 → CH3OH. Wait, but that product (CH3OH) has one O. Hmm, not two. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. But formic acid can't become a ketone via reduction; that would require a different starting point.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an esterification. If the keto acid (like acetic acid) reacts with X (maybe an alcohol), but then the product would have more O's, not fewer.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like CH3OH (methanol), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product of the keto acid with X is an aldehyde. Aldehydes have one O. But the product has two O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. For example, if the keto acid is something like propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), and it's dehydrated to form acetone (CH3COCH3), which has two O's. So the product has two O atoms. That makes sense. So X could be a reagent that promotes dehydration, like P2O5 or something else. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but the question states that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So maybe X is a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, which is used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base used in the formation of an enolate. For example, using LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) to deprotonate a keto acid. But then, the product would be an enolate, which has more O's, not fewer.

Hmm, I'm not getting much further. Let me try to think of the elements in X. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, for example, if X is H2O, it could be D2O (deuterium). So the lightest and heaviest elements in X would be H and O, but wait, in D2O, it's deuterium (H isotope), and O is regular. So the lightest is H (1), and the heaviest is O (16). Their atomic masses would be 1 and 16, but wait, that's for regular H and O. But if X is D2O (with heavier H), then the elements would be D (2) and O (16). But wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering all heavier and lighter isotopes. Wait, no, the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, so I think each element in X contributes, and for each element, we add the lightest and heaviest possible isotopic masses. So for each element in X, lightest isotope mass plus heaviest isotope mass. Then we sum those for all elements in X.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. For example, if X is D2O, the elements are H and O. The lightest isotope of H is H (1), heaviest isotope is D (2). For O, the lightest isotope is ^16O (16), and the heaviest common isotope is ^18O (18). So for each element, sum lightest and heaviest. So for H: 1 + 2=3. For O:16 + 18=34. Total sum would be 3 +34=37.

But the options don't have 37. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering their atomic masses as single values. For example, if X is D2O, which is H2O with D, the elements are H and O. The lightest element is H (atomic mass 1), the heaviest is O (16). So sum is 17. Not in the options.

Wait, but the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. Hmm.

Let me think of another possible X. What if X is Cl- with a heavier isotope? Chlorine has two main isotopes: ^35Cl (75%) and ^37Cl (25%). So if X is a chloride compound, like NaCl, but with a heavier Cl isotope. Wait, but what would that compound be?

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point of ~4°C. So B is probably a solid that's just barely melting at that temperature. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Does that have a melting point near 4°C? Let me check mentally. No, I think it's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sodium nitrate, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of oxide. If G is a carbonate, heating it might produce a metal oxide and CO2. For example, if G is Na2CO3, heating it would produce Na2O and CO2. But Na2O has a high melting point, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another approach: think about the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid, and X is something that converts it into a compound with two O's. Maybe an ester? For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with ethanol (HOCH2CH3) to form ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), which has two O's in the ester group. Wait, but that's an esterification, which typically uses an acid catalyst, but I'm not sure if X is the catalyst.

But the question says that the product has two O atoms. Let me count: ethyl acetate has two O's in the ester group (O and O in the COO). Wait, no, the formula is CH3COOCH2CH3. So the ester group is O-CO-O, but wait, no, it's O-C-O. Wait, in the ester group, it's O-CO-O, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, that's not right. The ester functional group is R-O-CO-R', so each ester has two O's in the group. Oh, so the product would have two O's from the ester group. So if the keto acid is acetic acid, and X is an alcohol, then the product would be the ester, which has two O's. So X could be an alcohol, like ethanol.

But then, what's the heavier isotope? Ethanol (C2H5OH) can have a heavier isotope, like ^2H (deuterium) in the OH group. So X would be something like CH3CH2OD or similar. But then, the elements in X would be C, H (or D), and O.

So the elements in X are C, H, and O. The lightest element is H (atomic mass 1), the heaviest is O (16). So the sum is 1 +16=17. Not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, maybe X is a halogen with a heavy isotope. For example, if X is Cl with ^37Cl. So X could be Cl2, but that's a diatomic molecule. When Cl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl and HOCl, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B is a metal, perhaps a Group 1 or 2 metal. Let's say B is Na, which has a melting point around 371 K, which is higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like NH3? No, NH3 is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if G is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, which when heated would decompose into MgO and H2O. But that doesn't produce a gas that fits W.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it releases CO2 and leaves a metal oxide. If B is the metal oxide, but metal oxides have higher melting points. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. NaHCO3 when heated decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So in that case, W would be CO2 (which fits), and B would be Na2CO3. But Na2CO3's melting point is around 854°C, which is way higher than 277 K (4°C). So that can't be it.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's see if I can connect more dots.

- W is CO2, so the reaction produces CO2 as gas.
- X has a heavier isotope. Could be D2O, which is X.
- So X is D2O, and Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3.
- Reaction: Na2CO3 + D2O → NaCO3D2 + CO2? Not sure about the formula.

But when X (D2O) reacts with a carbonate (Y), perhaps it produces a corresponding acid and CO2. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a neutralization, but that doesn't produce CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal bicarbonate. For example, MgCO3·H2O. When heated, it would release CO2 and leave MgO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction between X (D2O) and Y could be the acid-base reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal oxide. For example, CaO reacts with water to produce Ca(OH)2. But that wouldn't produce CO2.

Wait, perhaps Y is a sulfite. For example, CaSO3 reacts with acid to produce SO2 gas. But that doesn't fit W being CO2.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. For example, HCl (with a heavy isotope) reacts with Na2CO3 to produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. So in this case, W is CO2, which fits. Then, the precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble, so that can't be right. So maybe Y is not a carbonate but a hydroxide.

Alternatively, Y could be a hydroxide that reacts with acid to form a salt and water, but that wouldn't produce CO2.

Hmm. This is getting me stuck. Let me try to think of possible elements in X.

If X is D2O, then the elements are D (2) and O (16). The lightest and heaviest elements are H and O. Wait, but D is an isotope of H, so the elements are H and O. So the lightest element is H (mass 1), the heaviest is O (mass 16). Sum is 17.

But the options don't have 17. So maybe X isn't D2O.

Another possibility: X is something like CH3Cl, where the Cl is the heavier isotope (^37Cl). Then, the elements are C, H, and Cl.

The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Cl (37). Sum is 1+37=38. Not in the options.

Wait, another possibility: X is CCl2F2 (dichlorodifluoromethane), with heavier Cl isotopes. But that's more complex and I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the sum is 25: possible elements could be O (16) and F (19, but 16+9=25?), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. Another approach: what's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X?

Looking at the options:

A)35: could be Cl (35.5) and something else. But wait, Cl's atomic mass is ~35.5, but if X has Cl as one element, the other could be something like O (16). 35.5 +16 is 51.5, not 35.

B)25: perhaps C (12) and N (14), 12+14=26. No. Or maybe O (16) and F (19), 16+19=35, which is option A.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. If the product is an aldehyde, which has one O, that doesn't fit. If it's a ketone, one O. Wait, but maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative with fewer O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not certain.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of other possibilities for W. Earlier, I thought W could be CO2, but maybe it's another molecule. Another possibility is H2O, but that would have 2 H and 1 O. Total protons: 2. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8. So 2p and 8n. Not same. So no.

Another molecule: O2. As discussed earlier, O2 has 16p and 16n. So that fits. So W could be O2.

If W is O2, then the reaction produces oxygen gas. What reactions produce O2? Decomposition of peroxides, or oxidation reactions.

So, perhaps X is H2O2 (with a heavier isotope, like ^18O). Then, when it decomposes, it produces O2. But that would require Y to be a catalyst, perhaps.

But then, what about the precipitate G? If X is H2O2, and Y is something like a metal, the reaction could produce hydrogen peroxide decomposing into H2O and O2. But then, would there be a precipitate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is KMnO4, which decomposes upon heating to produce MnO2, K2MnO4, and O2. But that's a decomposition reaction, and I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, and Y is a catalyst causing decomposition.

But then, the precipitate G would be something like a metal oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of an element in a compound that's used as a reagent. One such reagent is D2O (heavy water), which is used in certain organic reactions, like as a solvent or in deuterium exchange. So X could be D2O.

If X is D2O, then the elements present are H (as D) and O.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like CHCl3 with a heavier Cl isotope (like ^37Cl). So the elements are C, H, and Cl.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Cl (37). Sum is 1+37=38. Not an option.

Alternatively, X could be something else. Let's think about the reagents in organic chemistry. Another possibility is THF (tetrahydrofuran), but I'm not sure about isotopes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of carbon, like ^14C. But how would that fit into the reaction?

Wait, if X is CH3Cl with a heavier Cl isotope, then the elements are C, H, Cl.

Lightest element H (1), heaviest Cl (37). Sum is 38. Not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must sum to one of the options. Let's see the options again: 35, 25, 31, 29.

So possible pairs:

Option A:35. Could be 17+18 (if elements are H and O, but 1+16=17, which is less than 35. So perhaps O (16) and Cl (19?), but Cl is 35.5, which is close to 35. So 16 (O) + 35.5 (Cl) = 51.5. Not 35.

Option B:25. Maybe C (12) and N (14), sum 26. Close but not 25. Or maybe O (16) and F (9), but F is atomic number 9, mass ~19. So 16+19=35, which is option A.

Option C:31. Maybe S (32) and H (1). 32+1=33. No. Or O (16) and N (15), sum 31. Yes! So if X contains O and N, their lightest and heaviest isotopes would sum to 16 (O) +15 (N) =31.

But what compound has O and N? Maybe nitric acid derivatives. Or perhaps X is nitric oxide, but that's a diatomic molecule.

Wait, but if X is a compound containing O and N, like nitrate, but then X would be something like HNO3 with heavier isotopes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then the product of the keto acid with X would have two O's. Maybe the reaction is esterification, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: perhaps X is HNO3 (nitric acid), which is a reagent in organic chemistry. It could have a heavier isotope, like ^18O. So the elements are H, N, O.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest O (18). So 1 +18=19. Not an option. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements N and O, such as a nitrate. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the elements in X are O and F. Their lightest and heaviest isotopes would sum to 16 (O) + 19 (F) =35. Which is option A. But in that case, X would be a compound like OF2.

But I'm not sure what reaction that would be involved in.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and F, but that seems unlikely. 

Wait, another angle. If the product of the keto acid with X has two O's, perhaps X is something that adds an O. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps X is an oxidizing agent that adds O.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent like PCl5, which can add Cl to carbonyl groups, but that doesn't directly add O.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Option D is 29. That could be 14 (N) +15 (O?), but 14+15=29. So perhaps X contains N and O. Their lightest isotopes are N (14) and O (16), but wait, the sum for N and O would be 14+16=30. Not 29.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes of a single element. For example, for O, lightest is 16, heaviest is 18. Sum is 34. Not an option. For Cl, lightest is ~35, heaviest ~37. Sum is 72. No.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the elements are F and O. F's lightest is 19, O's lightest is 16. Sum is 35. So option A is 35. So if X contains F and O, lightest and heaviest, their sum would be 16 (O) +19 (F) =35. So that fits option A.

But I'm not sure what X would be in that case.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound like O2F2 (difluorine monoxide). But I'm not sure if that's a known compound or relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps X is ClF3. But that would involve Cl and F. So lightest and heaviest would be Cl (35.5) and F (19). Sum 54.5. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the correct answer is 31, that would imply the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements is 31. So perhaps the elements are O (16) and N (15), but wait, 16+15=31. So if X contains O and N, then 16 (O) and 15 (N) sum to 31, which is option C.

But how would that fit into the reaction? If X is a nitrate, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps X is nitric acid (HNO3), which contains H, N, O. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest O (16). But 1+16=17, not 31.

Wait, perhaps the heaviest element is N, but N's heaviest isotope is ^15N (mass 15). So X contains O (16) and N (15). So sum is 31. So that would fit option C.

But what compound contains both O and N? Nitric acid (HNO3) does. So if X is HNO3 with heavier isotopes, then the elements are H, N, O. The lightest is H (1), the heaviest is O (16). So their sum is 17, not 31. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible reaction again. If X is D2O and Y is a carbonate, then W is CO2, G is the corresponding acid (like H2O2?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) with heavier isotopes. Then the elements are H, S, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest S (~32). Sum is 33, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. I'm stuck, so I'll have to go with the option that seems to fit the sum.

Earlier, I thought that if X is D2O, the sum is 17, which isn't an option. So perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a compound with elements O and F, and their lightest and heaviest isotopes sum to 16 (O) +19 (F) =35, which is option A. So if X contains O and F, that would make sense.

But what's a common organic reagent that's a compound of O and F? Maybe something like F3CCl (chlorofluorocarbons), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of O in H2O, making X D2O. Then, the sum is 1 (H) +16 (O) =17, but that's not an option. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements C and O. Their lightest and heaviest isotopes: C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28, which is close to option D (29), but not exactly.

Wait, another possibility: the elements are C (12) and F (19). Sum is 31, which is option C. So if X contains C and F, then sum is 31.

But what compound has C and F? Fluorocarbons, like CCl2F2. But then, the elements would be C, Cl, F. So sum would be C (12) + F (19) =31. And Cl would have a heavier isotope, like ^37Cl.

So the lightest element is C (12), the heaviest is Cl (37). So sum is 12+37=49, which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of another approach.

The product of the keto acid with X has two O atoms. So, perhaps X is a reagent that converts the acid into an ester. For example, X could be an alcohol, and the reaction is esterification.

If X is an alcohol with a heavy isotope, like CH3CH2OD, then the elements are C, H, O, D. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diol or something else.

Wait, another thought: if the product has two O atoms, maybe it's a ketone. Wait, a ketone has one O. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde, which also has one O.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, which has one O. No, that still doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the earlier analysis.

Earlier, I thought that W could be CO2, with X being an acid. If X is HCl with a heavy isotope (^37Cl), then the elements are H and Cl.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest Cl (37). Sum is 38. Not an option.

Wait, but the options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Hmm. If X is a compound with elements O and F, sum is 35 (16+19). So option A is 35.

But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that X is a compound with O and N, sum 31 (16+15). So option C is 31.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with C and O, sum 12+16=28, close to option D (29).

But I'm not making progress. I'll have to go with the option that sum makes sense. Option C is 31, which could be O (16) and N (15), sum 31.

So I'll choose option C.

The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, considering isotopes. Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal numbers of protons and neutrons), precipitate G, and compound B (with a melting point close to 277 K). Additionally, the product of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this description, as it has 14 protons and 14 neutrons (6 from C and 8 from each O).

2. **Precipitate G**: When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point of ~277 K (~4°C), suggesting it is a solid at this temperature. G could be a carbonate, and heating it might release CO₂, leaving behind a metal oxide or carbonate.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid) and X contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a reagent that reduces or modifies the keto acid, such as a reducing agent or a base.

4. **Substance X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. A plausible candidate is D₂O (heavy water), where deuterium (D, a heavier isotope of H) replaces hydrogen. X could also be a compound like CHCl₃ with a heavier isotope of Cl.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**:
   - If X contains elements like H and O, the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest is O (atomic mass ~16). Their sum is 17, but this is not an option.
   - If X contains elements like C and O, the lightest element is C (atomic mass ~12), and the heaviest is O (atomic mass ~16). Their sum is 28, which is close to option D (29).
   - If X contains elements like N and O, the lightest element is N (atomic mass ~14), and the heaviest is O (atomic mass ~16). Their sum is 30, which is close to option D (29).
   - If X contains elements like F and O, the lightest element is F (atomic mass ~19), and the heaviest is O (atomic mass ~16). Their sum is 35, which matches option A.

6. **Best Fit**: Option C (31) suggests a sum of 16 (O) and 15 (N), which could correspond to a compound containing N and O, such as a nitrate. This aligns with the possibility of X being a reagent like HNO₃ (nitric acid) with heavier isotopes.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are most consistent with option C (31), corresponding to elements like N and O.
