Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's nine carbons, eleven hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. 

Looking at the IR first. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1 might suggest N-H stretching, like from an amide or amine. Amides typically show a broad peak around that area because of hydrogen bonding. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group. That's a lot like an ester or a ketone, but esters are more common. Wait, maybe it's an amide carbonyl too? Because amides also have carbonyls around 1650-1700. Hmm, but 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. But wait, wait, the molecule has two oxygen atoms. Let me think about the structure.

Now, looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them out:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet around 1.2 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a CH2.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two hydrogens. Broad usually indicates exchange or maybe a -NH group. But at 4.0, maybe it's an oxygenated methylene, like OCH2. But the broadness makes me think of an NH group. Wait, but if the integration is 2H, it's not NH (since amines have more than one H, but maybe it's an amide's NH? Or maybe it's part of an ester or ether.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. 2H, quartet, maybe a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl ester. The quartet at around 4.5 ppm often corresponds to the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. So maybe this is the OCH2CH3 group. Wait, but the triplet at 1.20 is a triplet, which would fit with an ethyl group where the CH3 is attached to a CH2 that's next to an oxygen. So, ethyl ester perhaps.

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm might be due to electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe a nitro group, but wait, the compound has NO2? No, the formula is C9H11NO2. Oh, wait no, the formula is C9H11NO2. So, substituents on the ring could be an amino group (NH2) or carbonyl (like COOEt).

Putting it together, maybe the structure is an ethyl ester of a nitro compound? Or perhaps a substituted benzoate.

Now, the options are:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (so CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, but benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The IR would show the amide N-H stretch, which is broad around 3300, which fits. The carbonyl would be around 1680, which is a bit lower than 1720, but maybe possible. Hmm. The NMR: the ethoxy would have a triplet at around 1.2 and a quartet at around 4.0. Wait, but in benzamide, the amide protons would show up as a broad signal. But the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0, which could be the OCH2 group. But the integration is 2H, so that's probably the ethoxy OCH2CH3. Then, the quartet at 4.5 would be for something else. Wait, maybe the amide. No, the benzamide would have NH groups. But in the NMR, I don't see a peak that integrates to 1H for NH. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The formamide would have a carbonyl (around 1700), which matches the IR. The ethoxy would again have triplet at 1.2 and quartet around 4.0. The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5, which would be the NH2 (but wait, formamide is HCONH2, so the NH would be a singlet? Or split into multiplet? Not sure. But the 4.5 quartet is 2H, so perhaps not the NH2. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH2Ph. Wait, but the structure might be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? No, that's more like ethyl propionate. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph? Not sure. Alternatively, it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, but the formula would be C11H15NO3, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEtOOC-C6H4-NH2, para substitution. So the benzoate ester would have the ester carbonyl (around 1720, which matches the IR). The ethyl group would have triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2CH3). The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) might not fit though. Wait, 4.0 is a singlet, 2H. Hmm, maybe it's a NH group. Wait, the amine would be NH2. But in the NMR, the only signals are in the 1.2, 4.0, 4.5, and aromatic regions. So for the ethyl benzoate, the OCH2CH3 would be at 4.5, quartet. But where is the NH2? It's a broad peak, maybe around 1-5 ppm. But the NMR doesn't show a peak that integrates to 2H in the 1-3 ppm region. Or perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up? Wait, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 2H. Could that be the NH2? But in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amine is a secondary amine (since it's attached to the benzene ring), so it's NH2. The NMR usually shows NH2 as a broad peak, maybe around 2-5 ppm, but integrating for 2H. So the 4.0 ppm peak being a broad singlet of 2H fits for the NH2.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have peaks for the ethyl group: 1.2 (t, 3H), 4.5 (q, 2H). Then, the NH2 would be a broad singlet at around 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, one at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. But wait, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the benzoate ester is at para position to the amine. So the aromatic ring would have two substituents: the NH2 and the COOEt. So the ring would have two doublets: the H ortho to COOEt would be more downfield, perhaps around 8.0, and the H ortho to NH2 would be more upfield? Or wait, the substituents are in para positions. So the ring has two substituents opposite each other: NH2 and COOEt.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. Let's see, the protons adjacent to COOEt (which is an electron-withdrawing group) would be deshielded, hence more downfield. So one doublet at 8.0 ppm, and the other (para to that) would have protons that are more upfield, perhaps around 7.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data. 

So putting it all together, the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR shows the ester carbonyl at 1720. The OCH2CH3 would have the triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The NH2 would appear as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, integrating for 2H. The aromatic protons are two doublets, which makes sense for a para-substituted benzene.

Let me cross-check the options. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So that's looking good. 

Another thought: what about option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide? Its structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OEt. The IR would have a strong carbonyl (formamide is around 1700), which is close to 1720. The ethoxy group would have the same triplet and quartet as the ester does. The formamide would have NH2, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is 2H. Wait, formamide's NH2 would typically be around 5-8 ppm as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, 2H. That doesn't fit the NH2 group. Also, the quartet at 4.5 could be something else, maybe the formamide's CH group? Or perhaps the OCH2 from ethoxy? I'm getting a bit confused, but probably option D is more consistent.

Wait, in the given NMR, the peaks are at 4.0 (bs, 2H) and 4.5 (q, 2H). For option D, the ethyl ester would have 4.5 as the OCH2CH3 (quartet), and the NH2 would be at 4.0 (but that's a bit upfield for an amine). Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the NH2. Usually, amines in aromatic compounds can be broad but might not appear in the 4.0 region. Wait, in the case of aniline derivatives, the NH2 is usually around 4-5 ppm but can vary. So 4.0 as a singlet could be the NH2. 

Looking back at the options, option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. The propionate would have a longer chain, like CH2CH2COO-. But the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check that. Phenyl (C6H5) plus NH2 (adds 1N, 2H), and the propionate would be C3H5O2. So total C6+3=9, H5+2 (from NH2) +5 (from propionate's CH2CH2COO-) = wait, perhaps miscalculating. Alternatively, the propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene ring via the amino group. That would give C6H4NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be C10H13NO3, which doesn't match. So perhaps option C is not the right one.

So going back, the most likely option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR shows the ester carbonyl, the NMR has the ethyl groups and the NH2.

The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, and the spectral data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. Here's the analysis:

### IR Analysis:
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These suggest the presence of N-H stretching, likely from an amide or amine group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely from an NH2 group (secondary amine).
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of the OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Contains a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group.  
   - The IR would show an amide carbonyl (~1680 cm⁻¹), but the given IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more consistent with an ester.  
   - The NMR lacks a peak for the NH2 group of the benzamide, making this option unlikely.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Contains a formamide group (HCONH-) and an ethoxy group.  
   - The IR would show a formamide carbonyl (~1700 cm⁻¹), which is close to 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - However, the NMR does not show a peak in the expected region for the NH2 group of the formamide (~5-8 ppm).  
   - The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) does not fit the NH2 group, making this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Contains a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) and an NH2 group.  
   - The molecular formula would not match C9H11NO2, as it would require more carbons and oxygens.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the given data.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Contains a benzoate ester (COOEt) and an NH2 group.  
   - The IR shows a strong carbonyl band at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with an ester.  
   - The NMR matches well:  
     - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: CH3 of the ethyl ester.  
     - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: NH2 group.  
     - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: OCH2 of the ethyl ester.  
     - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons on a para-substituted benzene.  
   - This option is consistent with all the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, corresponding to **Option D**.

Alternatively, the propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene ring via the amino group. That would give C6H4NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be C10H13NO3, which doesn't match. So perhaps option C is not the right one.

So going back, the most likely option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR shows the ester carbonyl, the NMR has the ethyl groups and the NH2.
