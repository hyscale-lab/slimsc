Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let's see what the question says. 

First, the problem mentions two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmmm, but wait, I'm not sure if the mass is relevant here. Since the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature, maybe the mass is just extra info or a distractor.

The key points I should focus on are the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and their radial velocities. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law. The law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ1 = λ2. If both emit as black bodies, then according to Wien's Law, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is the same. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T, same λ implies same T. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait a second, but then I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So since both have the same T, the luminosity depends on R squared. 

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, L1 should be (1.5)^2 times L2, which is 2.25 times. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the only choice. Let me check the options again. 

Option A is ~2.25. So that would be the factor if all else is equal. But wait, the problem also talks about radial velocities. Oh, right! Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength will be different from the rest wavelength.

So the stars' actual temperatures might be different, but their observed peak wavelengths might be the same because of the Doppler shift. Hmm, wait, this is getting more complicated. So maybe I need to factor in the Doppler shift when considering their temperatures.

Let me think. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us. Since radial velocity is positive when moving away, but I'm not sure about the convention here. Wait, the radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving relative to us. Let me clarify the Doppler effect.

The Doppler shift formula is λ = λ0 (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no, that's the relativistic Doppler effect, but for small velocities compared to the speed of light, the approximation is λ_shift = λ * (1 + v/c), where v is positive for moving away. But wait, actually, the exact formula is a bit more precise. The full Doppler shift formula when the source is moving with velocity v is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but that's for transverse motion. Wait, no, that's when the motion is perpendicular. For radial motion (directly towards or away), the formula is λ = λ0 * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but when v is much smaller than c, it's approximated as λ ≈ λ0 (1 + v/c).

Wait, but actually, for the radial Doppler effect, the formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards). So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we have to adjust its observed wavelength.

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ1 = observed λ2.

Star_1 has v_r = 0, so its observed λ1 is equal to its rest λ1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, so its observed λ2 is λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c). 

Wait, but no, the actual λ_max for each star depends on their temperatures. So λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2. But when we observe them, their wavelengths are shifted due to their velocities.

So the observed λ1 is λ1_rest (since v_r1 = 0), and observed λ2 is λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c). 

Since the observed λ's are the same, we have:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c)

But λ1_rest is b / T1, and λ2_rest is b / T2.

So substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Rearranging,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2 / c

Wait, no, let me re-express that.

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2 / c ) * (1/T2 )

So,

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2 / c ) / T2

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2 / c

But wait, that's not correct. Let me write it again.

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2 / c ) * (1/T2 )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, no,

Wait,

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2 / c ) * (1/T2 )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )

Hmm, so T2 is larger than T1 if v_r2 is positive (since v_r2 is 700 km/s). Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength, implying that the star's actual temperature is lower than what's observed.

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think. If a star is moving away from us, the light is redshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is longer. Since λ is proportional to 1/T, a longer λ implies lower temperature. So the star's actual temperature is higher than what we measure. 

Wait, no. Wait, the star emits at λ_rest = b / T. If the star is moving away, the observed λ is λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v/c). So λ_obs is longer than λ_rest, so λ_obs = b / T * (1 + v/c) = (b / T) (1 + v/c ). So the observed λ is longer, which would correspond to a lower temperature than the actual T. Because λ_max = b / T => T = b / λ_max. So higher λ implies lower T. But in reality, the star's temperature is T, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ is larger, making us think T is lower.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed λ where they appear brightest is the same for both stars. So:

λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs1 is λ_rest1 (since v_r1 is 0). So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Because λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest is given by λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T2 / T1 = 1 + (v_r2 / c )

Given that v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute that.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333...

So v_r2 / c ≈ 0.02333.

So,

T2 / T1 ≈ 1 + 0.02333 = 1.02333.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 * 1.02333.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than that of Star_1.

Now, the luminosity of a star is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So L1 = factor * L2.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Because the 4π σ is same for both.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

R1 / R2 = 1.5 => (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

So,

T2 / T1 = 1.02333.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.977)^4.

Calculating that:

0.977^2 = approx 0.954. Then square that: 0.954^2 ≈ 0.91.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ 0.91.

So putting it all together,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.91) ≈ 2.0475.

Wait, but wait, that calculation gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.0475, which is about 2.05. But the options are all around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc. Hmm, that's a problem because my calculation here doesn't match any option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

Wait, when I calculated T2 in terms of T1, I think I made a mistake.

Earlier, from the equation:

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) * (1/T2 )

So,

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2

Then,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 is larger than T1. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5) )

Which is,

T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.002333) = T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. 700 divided by 3e5 is 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait no, that's 700/3e5 is 700 / 300,000 = 7/(300) = 0.02333. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought v_r2 is 700 km/s. So 700/3e5 = 0.002333? No, 3e5 is 300,000. 700 / 300,000 is 0.002333. So v_r2/c is 0.002333.

So,

1 + v_r2/c = 1.002333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So,

T2 / T1 = 1.002333.

So,

(T1 / T2 )= 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Calculating that:

0.99767^2 is approximately 0.99535.

Then, squared again: 0.99535^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.228, which is around 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought the mass didn't matter. Because the problem says the luminosity is computed based on blackbody radiation. So the mass isn't directly involved, except perhaps in determining the radius or temperature, but in this case, the radius and temperature are already given through other means (radius ratio and same observed λ_max).

So, the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)).
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity \( v_{r,1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_2 has \( v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - The stars radiate as blackbodies, so their luminosities follow the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   - The peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant.
   - For Star_1, since \( v_{r,1} = 0 \), its observed wavelength equals its rest wavelength:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{rest},1} = \frac{b}{T_1}
     \]
   - For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs},2} = \lambda_{\text{rest},2} \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r,2}}{c} \right)
     \]
     where \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \), we equate the two expressions:  
     \[
     \frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r,2}}{c} \right)
     \]
     Simplifying,  
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_{r,2}}{c}
     \]
     Substituting \( v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):  
     \[
     \frac{v_{r,2}}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
     \]
     Thus,  
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333
     \]
     Therefore,  
     \[
     T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity ratio is given by:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \):  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{1.002333} \right)^4
     \]
     - \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767 \), and  
       \[
       (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
       \]
     Thus,  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
