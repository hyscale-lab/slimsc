Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin of an electron along the y-direction, S_y. The electron is in the spin state given as (3i, 4). Wait, I'm a bit confused about how to represent that. Oh right, spin states are usually column vectors. So, the state vector ψ should be a column with the first component 3i and the second 4. So ψ = [3i; 4].

I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. Oh wait, S_y is related to the Pauli matrix σ_y. Right, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times σ. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

What's σ_y again? Oh right, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So putting it together, S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, to find the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Let me break that down step by step.

First, compute ψ†, the conjugate transpose of ψ. Since ψ is [3i; 4], the conjugate would be [-3, 4], because 3i's conjugate is -3i's real part? Wait, no, conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no, wait. The complex conjugate of a number like a + bi is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, its conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. Wait, but in the vector, the first component is 3i, which is 0 + 3i. So ψ is [3i, 4] as a column. So the conjugate is [-3i, 4]^T? Wait, no, wait. The conjugate of 3i is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, no, the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So the conjugate transpose of ψ would be the row vector [ -3i , 4 ].

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the product ψ† S_y is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by S_y. Let me compute S_y first.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [0, -i],
           [i, 0] ]

So when I compute ψ† S_y, it's a row vector multiplied by a matrix. Let's compute that:

ψ† S_y = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Let me compute the matrix multiplication part first. The [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, [a b] * [[c d], [e f]] equals [a*c + b*e , a*d + b*f].

So for the first element: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i^2) +0. Wait, i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So 3i*(-i) is 3i^2 = -3. Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, (-3i) * (-i) is (3i^2) because (-3i)*(-i) = 3 i^2. But i^2 is -1, so it's 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is (-3i)*(-i) = 3i^2 = -3, plus 4*0 is 0. So the second element is -3.

So the result of [ -3i,4 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] is [4i, -3].

Wait, wait, no:

Wait the matrix multiplication is (row vector) multiplied by the matrix.

The first component is (row[0] * column 0) + (row[1] * column 0 of next column?)

Wait, wait, perhaps an alternative approach: Let me compute each term.

Wait, the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So when I multiply [ a b ] * matrix, it's a*[0, -i] + b*[i, 0].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, matrix multiplication is [a b] multiplied by the matrix (each row of the matrix becomes a column in the multiplication). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe to compute [a b] * [[c d], [e f]]:

It's a*c + b*e for the first element, and a*d + b*f for the second.

So back to [ -3i, 4 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0 = 3i^2 +0. i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1)= -3.

So the result is [4i, -3].

But wait, because S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix, the entire ψ† S_y would be (ħ/2) times [4i, -3].

So ψ† S_y = (ħ/2) [4i, -3].

Now, the next step is to multiply this by ψ, which is [3i;4], so the product is (ħ/2) [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

So, the product [4i, -3] * [3i;4] is (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4).

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

(-3)*4 = -12.

So summing these gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

Then, multiply by (ħ/2): (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, wait, so the expectation value is -12 ħ /2 multiplied by 2? No, no, wait. Let me see.

Wait, wait no. The product [4i, -3] * [3i;4] is 4i*3i + (-3)*4.

Which is (12 i²) + (-12) = 12*(-1) + (-12) = -12 -12 = -24.

So the entire expectation is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option A is -12 hbar/25, and B is 12 hbar/25. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait a minute, did I do something wrong here. Because the expectation value I got is -12 ħ, but the options have fractions with 25.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the state vector. Oh wait, the state is (3i, 4), but I think I forgot to normalize it. Because the state vector should have a norm of 1. So the first step is to compute the normalization factor.

Ah, right! Because when you have a state vector, it's necessary to normalize it. So the state given is (3i, 4), but perhaps it's not normalized. So I should compute the norm, and then divide each component by that norm to get the normalized state.

So to find the normalization, the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2.

|3i|^2 is (3)^2 =9, since |a i|^2 = a^2.

|4|^2 is 16.

So the norm squared is 9 + 16 =25. So the norm is 5.

Therefore, the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5).

So ψ = [3i/5; 4/5].

Ah, I see where I went wrong. I forgot to normalize the state vector. So I need to redo the calculation with the normalized ψ.

Let me correct this.

So ψ is [3i/5; 4/5].

So ψ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Now, let's recompute ψ† S_y ψ.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y is:

(ħ/2) * [
[0, -i],
[i, 0]
]

Compute ψ† S_y:

ψ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]

Multiply by S_y:

[ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix multiplication part is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Again, using the same method as before:

First element: (-3i/5)*0 + (4/5)*i = 0 + (4i/5) = 4i/5.

Second element: (-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0.

Compute (-3i/5)*(-i) = (3i^2)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5. Because i*(-i) is i^2 which is -1. Wait, wait.

Wait, (-3i/5) * (-i) = (3i * i) /5 = 3i² /5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So the second element is -3/5.

So the product of ψ† and S_y is (ħ/2) times [4i/5, -3/5].

Wait, no, the ψ† multiplied by S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [4i/5, -3/5]. So ψ† S_y = (ħ/2) [4i/5, -3/5].

Now, multiply this by ψ, which is [3i/5; 4/5].

So [4i/5, -3/5] multiplied by [3i/5; 4/5].

Compute each term:

First term: (4i/5) * (3i/5) = (12 i^2)/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (-3/5) * (4/5) = (-12)/25.

Sum these two: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ) / (50) = (-12 ħ)/25.

So the expectation value is -12 ħ /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. So the correct answer should be option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalize the state vector**:  
   The given state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \) is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \implies \|\psi\| = 5.
   \]  
   The normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) as:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Expectation value formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \) and \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \), we compute:  
   \[
   \langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Matrix multiplication**:  
   First, compute \( \langle \psi | S_y \):  
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, multiply with \( | \psi \rangle \):  
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) \cdot \frac{4}{5}.
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   \[
   \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25},
   \]  
   \[
   \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) \cdot \frac{4}{5} = -\frac{12}{25}.
   \]  
   Adding these gives:  
   \[
   -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}.
   \]

5. **Final expectation value**:  
   Multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
