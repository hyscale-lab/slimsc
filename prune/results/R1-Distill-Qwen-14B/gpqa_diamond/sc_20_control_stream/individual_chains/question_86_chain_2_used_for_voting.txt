Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. It's about reducing agents and stereochemistry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R configuration and the other is S.

So the reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

Wait, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in conditions that can lead to different products than BH3. Oh right, BH3 is a milder reducing agent and typically used for ketone reductions under specific conditions, maybe in a way that affects stereochemistry.

Wait, but what's the starting material here? Both A and B are being treated with different reagents. The options given are for A and B being different or same compounds.

Looking at the options:

Options A and B have both A and B as same compounds, just S and R in C and D.

Wait, the products are both the same ketone but different stereoisomers. So, the starting materials must be carbonyl compounds (like ketones or esters) that upon reduction form a pyranone.

Wait, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Wait, no, pyranone is a six-membered ring with one oxygen and one ketone group.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

How does that form from a starting material? Let me think about the possible starting materials. The problem mentions that the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. Pentanoic acid means five carbons, with a COOH group. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2CO... Wait, the substituents are 3-ethyl, 5-isobutoxy, and 5-oxo.

So the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl)
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: O-isobutyl (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and also a ketone (oxo) at position 5.

Wait, does that make sense? So the molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it.

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5
Positions: 1 is COOH, 2 is CH2, 3 is CH with ethyl, 4 is CH2, 5 is C=O and OCH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, but wait, 5 is both a ketone and an ether? That can't be. Because the structure would be:

At position 5, there's a carbonyl group (from 5-oxo) and an isobutoxy group (5-isobutoxy). So it's O=C-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that would imply a cyclic structure? Or perhaps, the 5 position is a ketone and an ether. Wait, but 5-oxo suggests a carbonyl group, and 5-isobutoxy suggests an ether group attached there. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The main chain is pentanoic acid, meaning five carbons in the chain, with COOH at the end. So:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH-ethyl
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C=O and OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that can't be because carbon 5 is the end. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a branching. Maybe it's:

The structure is CH2CH2CO... No, maybe not. Let me try again. The starting material is a pentanoic acid, so the formula is CH2CH2COOH but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is more accurately:

The structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that would make the 5th carbon as the fourth in the chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester or something similar, which upon reduction would form a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic ketone.

Wait, when you reduce a β-keto ester, you typically get a diol, but wait, the product here is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, wait. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, pyran is a six-membered ring with oxygen. The 2H indicates that the ring has two double bonds? No, wait, the H in pyran numbering refers to the number of double bonds. 2H-pyran is a fully saturated ring with one oxygen, so it's a tetrahydropyran. The position 2 is a ketone (2-one), and position 4 has an ethyl group.

So the structure is a six-membered ring: O is in position 1, then positions 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, and 6.

Wait, how would this ring form from the starting material?

Maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group and an ester group in such a way that upon reduction, a cyclic hemiacetal is formed. Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, perhaps they're reducing carbonyl groups.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically reduces esters to alcohols, but under certain conditions, maybe it can do more. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, usually used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but sometimes in the presence of other groups.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Oh, wait, the starting material is an acid, so perhaps it's a β-keto acid or a β-keto ester.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So it has a ketone group (oxo) at position 5 and an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2CH3)2) at position 5 as well. Wait, that doesn't make sense because position 5 can't have both a carbonyl and an oxygen substituent. Oh, wait, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution? Like the same carbon has both the ketone and the ether group.

Hmm, but that's difficult because a carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon can't have another substituent unless it's a ketone with an oxygen attached. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is:

The pentanoic acid chain is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)-COOH?

No, that would place the substituents on the same carbon. Wait, maybe it's 5-oxo meaning a carbonyl, and 5-isobutoxy meaning an ether at position 5. So maybe the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 -COOH?

Wait, no, because the acid is at position 1. So the chain is:

1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH-ethyl), 4 (CH2), 5 (C=O and OCH(CH2CH3)2).

Wait, that can't be. So maybe the 5 position is a carbonyl group, and the 5-isobutoxy is some other group. Wait, perhaps the 5 position is a carbonyl attached to an oxygen with an isobutoxy group. So the structure could be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Hmm, but that would mean the 5th carbon (from the COOH end) is a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen with an isobutoxy group. So the structure would be a β-keto ester — like a compound where there's a ketone adjacent to an ester.

When you reduce a β-keto ester, you can get different products depending on the conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reductant and might reduce the ester group as well as the ketone, but BH3 might only reduce the ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. How does that happen? Oh, wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol or something that can cyclize.

Wait, another possibility: the reduction of a β-keto ester with LiBH4 could lead to the formation of a cyclic ketone. But I'm not recalling exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. When reduced, it would form a cyclic diol, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid. When reduced, it forms a diol, which can cyclize to form a ring. Hmm.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction forms a secondary alcohol that cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So the starting material must have the necessary groups to form that ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyloin or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reagents and their effects.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3, especially when used with THF as a catalyst, is a milder reductant that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols but doesn't reduce esters under normal conditions. But wait, that's not entirely true. BH3 can reduce esters in certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the problem, both reactions produce a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction is leading to the formation of a diol, which then forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, but in the product, the ketone is at position 2. So maybe the starting material is an α, β-unsaturated ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When you reduce β-keto esters, the ester is typically reduced to a diol, but in some cases, with strong reducing agents, it can form a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon further reaction becomes the pyranone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong enough reductant that can reduce esters. So the ester group in the starting material would be reduced to a diol. Then, the diol would cyclize to form a ring.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would have a pentanoic acid chain, with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So the structure is:

COOH-(CH2)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-(CH2)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, so that's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

So, the starting material is a β-keto ester. Because the ketone is at position 5, which is adjacent to the ester group.

So, when you reduce a β-keto ester with LiBH4, you would typically reduce the ester to a primary alcohol and the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, so that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. For example, a five-membered ring with a ketone and an ester group. But the product is a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring. Let me think about the possible reaction.

When β-keto ester is reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, the ketone group is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol. So the product would be a diol. Then, under certain conditions, perhaps those diols can undergo cyclization to form a cyclic structure.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction doesn't fully reduce the ketone. Alternatively, maybe only the ester is reduced, leaving the ketone intact. But that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form a cyclic hemiacetal with the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product has R and S configurations depending on the reagent used.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to the formation of secondary alcohols from ketones with retention of configuration, but wait, in the case of cyclic ketones, the configuration would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, no, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reductant and typically gives the opposite configuration when reducing a ketone because it's a two-step process. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: the reduction of a ketone with BH3·THF typically gives an alcohol with retention of configuration (if the ketone is prochiral), but LiBH4 can lead to different stereochemistry? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, BH3 is a Lewis acid that can cause certain stereoselective reductions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and typically leads to more non-selective reductions, but when used with a ketone, it leads to the same stereochemistry as BH3? Or perhaps it depends on the conditions.

Wait, no, for ketone reductions, BH3 is more selective because it can form a more stable intermediate, leading to a certain configuration. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and might not be as selective, but in some cases, it can lead to different stereochemistry because of the reaction mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reagent determines whether it reduces the ester or the ketone. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a ketone group. When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, it reduces the ester to a diol, but leaves the ketone as is? No, because LiBH4 would likely reduce the ketone as well.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via a different mechanism. Let me think about the possibility of a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, but that requires vicinal diols and involves their dehydration to form carbonyl groups. But that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic compound, but that's getting complicated.

Alternative approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but how does that form a ketone? The β-keto ester has a ketone and an ester. Reducing the ester would give a diol, but the ketone is still present. Then, perhaps the diol and the ketone undergo some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is a lactone (cyclic ester), and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then forms a six-membered ring with the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize into a six-membered ring.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are about the configuration of A and B. So the starting materials A and B are either R or S configurations of the same compound.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is R and B is S.

So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it forms the R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it forms the S product.

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material influence the product's configuration?

If the starting material is a β-keto ester with a chiral center, then the reduction would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, in the starting material, the chiral center is at position 3 (3-ethyl). So the configuration (R or S) of that chiral center would influence the configuration of the product.

When the starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry at that center would be retained or inverted, depending on the reaction.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which has a stereocenter at position 4. So the ethyl group is at position 4. The configuration (R or S) of that position depends on the starting material's configuration and the reduction conditions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) at position 3 leads to the product's configuration at position 4 being R or S.

So, the stereochemistry of the starting material is transferred to the product's stereochemistry.

But how?

Let me visualize the molecule. The starting material is a β-keto ester with a chiral center at C3 (ethyl group). Upon reduction, perhaps the ester is reduced to a diol, and then a cyclization occurs, leading to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

The configuration of the starting material would influence the position of substituents during cyclization, thus determining the configuration of the product.

If the starting material is (R) configuration, then the product would be R, and if the starting material is (S), the product would be S.

But which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) would cause which configuration?

Wait, the product from A with LiBH4 is R. The product from B with BH3 is S.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, then if A is R, the product is R. If B is S, the product is S.

So, the starting material A must be R, and starting material B must be S.

Looking at the options, which option has A as R and B as S?

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one using different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which exist in either (R) or (S) configurations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones. It likely reduces the β-keto ester in the starting material to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. It also likely reduces the β-keto ester to a diol, which cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

2. **Product Formation**:
   - The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry at position 4 (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reduction conditions.

3. **Stereochemical Considerations**:
   - The starting material has a chiral center at position 3 (3-ethyl). The configuration (R or S) of this center determines the stereochemistry of the product.
   - If the starting material is (R), the product will be (R). If the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

4. **Matching Reagents to Products**:
   - The reaction with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product, so the starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
   - The reaction with BH3 produces the (S)-product, so the starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - Option D specifies A as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which matches the stereochemical requirements for the products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. It's about reducing agents and stereochemistry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R configuration and the other is S.

So the reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

Wait, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in conditions that can lead to different products than BH3. Oh right, BH3 is a milder reducing agent and typically used for ketone reductions under specific conditions, maybe in a way that affects stereochemistry.

Wait, but what's the starting material here? Both A and B are being treated with different reagents. The options given are for A and B being different or same compounds.

Looking at the options:

Options A and B have both A and B as same compounds, just S and R in C and D.

Wait, the products are both the same ketone but different stereoisomers. So, the starting materials must be carbonyl compounds (like ketones or esters) that upon reduction form a pyranone.

Wait, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Wait, no, pyranone is a six-membered ring with one oxygen and one ketone group.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

How does that form from a starting material? Let me think about the possible starting materials. The problem mentions that the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. Pentanoic acid means five carbons, with a COOH group. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2CO... Wait, the substituents are 3-ethyl, 5-isobutoxy, and 5-oxo.

So the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl)
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: O-isobutyl (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and also a ketone (oxo) at position 5.

Wait, does that make sense? So the molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it.

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5
Positions: 1 is COOH, 2 is CH2, 3 is CH with ethyl, 4 is CH2, 5 is C=O and OCH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, but wait, 5 is both a ketone and an ether? That can't be. Because the structure would be:

At position 5, there's a carbonyl group (from 5-oxo) and an isobutoxy group (5-isobutoxy). So it's O=C-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that would imply a cyclic structure? Or perhaps, the 5 position is a ketone and an ether. Wait, but 5-oxo suggests a carbonyl group, and 5-isobutoxy suggests an ether group attached there. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The main chain is pentanoic acid, meaning five carbons in the chain, with COOH at the end. So:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH-ethyl
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C=O and OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that can't be because carbon 5 is the end. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a branching. Maybe it's:

The structure is CH2CH2CO... No, maybe not. Let me try again. The starting material is a pentanoic acid, so the formula is CH2CH2COOH but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is more accurately:

The structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that would make the 5th carbon as the fourth in the chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester or something similar, which upon reduction would form a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic ketone.

Wait, when you reduce a β-keto ester, you typically get a diol, but wait, the product here is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, wait. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, pyran is a six-membered ring with oxygen. The 2H indicates that the ring has two double bonds? No, wait, the H in pyran numbering refers to the number of double bonds. 2H-pyran is a fully saturated ring with one oxygen, so it's a tetrahydropyran. The position 2 is a ketone (2-one), and position 4 has an ethyl group.

So the structure is a six-membered ring: O is in position 1, then positions 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, and 6.

Wait, how would this ring form from the starting material?

Maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group and an ester group in such a way that upon reduction, a cyclic hemiacetal is formed. Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, perhaps they're reducing carbonyl groups.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically reduces esters to alcohols, but under certain conditions, maybe it can do more. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, usually used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but sometimes in the presence of other groups.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Oh, wait, the starting material is an acid, so perhaps it's a β-keto acid or a β-keto ester.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So it has a ketone group (oxo) at position 5 and an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2CH3)2) at position 5 as well. Wait, that doesn't make sense because position 5 can't have both a carbonyl and an oxygen substituent. Oh, wait, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution? Like the same carbon has both the ketone and the ether group.

Hmm, but that's difficult because a carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon can't have another substituent unless it's a ketone with an oxygen attached. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is:

The pentanoic acid chain is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)-COOH?

No, that would place the substituents on the same carbon. Wait, maybe it's 5-oxo meaning a carbonyl, and 5-isobutoxy meaning an ether at position 5. So maybe the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 -COOH?

Wait, no, because the acid is at position 1. So the chain is:

1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH-ethyl), 4 (CH2), 5 (C=O and OCH(CH2CH3)2).

Wait, that can't be. So maybe the 5 position is a carbonyl group, and the 5-isobutoxy is some other group. Wait, perhaps the 5 position is a carbonyl attached to an oxygen with an isobutoxy group. So the structure could be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Hmm, but that would mean the 5th carbon (from the COOH end) is a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen with an isobutoxy group. So the structure would be a β-keto ester — like a compound where there's a ketone adjacent to an ester.

When you reduce a β-keto ester, you can get different products depending on the conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reductant and might reduce the ester group as well as the ketone, but BH3 might only reduce the ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. How does that happen? Oh, wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol or something that can cyclize.

Wait, another possibility: the reduction of a β-keto ester with LiBH4 could lead to the formation of a cyclic ketone. But I'm not recalling exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. When reduced, it would form a cyclic diol, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid. When reduced, it forms a diol, which can cyclize to form a ring. Hmm.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction forms a secondary alcohol that cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So the starting material must have the necessary groups to form that ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyloin or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reagents and their effects.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3, especially when used with THF as a catalyst, is a milder reductant that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols but doesn't reduce esters under normal conditions. But wait, that's not entirely true. BH3 can reduce esters in certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the problem, both reactions produce a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction is leading to the formation of a diol, which then forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, but in the product, the ketone is at position 2. So maybe the starting material is an α, β-unsaturated ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When you reduce β-keto esters, the ester is typically reduced to a diol, but in some cases, with strong reducing agents, it can form a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon further reaction becomes the pyranone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong enough reductant that can reduce esters. So the ester group in the starting material would be reduced to a diol. Then, the diol would cyclize to form a ring.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would have a pentanoic acid chain, with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So the structure is:

COOH-(CH2)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-(CH2)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, so that's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

So, the starting material is a β-keto ester. Because the ketone is at position 5, which is adjacent to the ester group.

So, when you reduce a β-keto ester with LiBH4, you would typically reduce the ester to a primary alcohol and the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, so that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. For example, a five-membered ring with a ketone and an ester group. But the product is a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring. Let me think about the possible reaction.

When β-keto ester is reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, the ketone group is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol. So the product would be a diol. Then, under certain conditions, perhaps those diols can undergo cyclization to form a cyclic structure.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction doesn't fully reduce the ketone. Alternatively, maybe only the ester is reduced, leaving the ketone intact. But that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form a cyclic hemiacetal with the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product has R and S configurations depending on the reagent used.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to the formation of secondary alcohols from ketones with retention of configuration, but wait, in the case of cyclic ketones, the configuration would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, no, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reductant and typically gives the opposite configuration when reducing a ketone because it's a two-step process. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: the reduction of a ketone with BH3·THF typically gives an alcohol with retention of configuration (if the ketone is prochiral), but LiBH4 can lead to different stereochemistry? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, BH3 is a Lewis acid that can cause certain stereoselective reductions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and typically leads to more non-selective reductions, but when used with a ketone, it leads to the same stereochemistry as BH3? Or perhaps it depends on the conditions.

Wait, no, for ketone reductions, BH3 is more selective because it can form a more stable intermediate, leading to a certain configuration. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and might not be as selective, but in some cases, it can lead to different stereochemistry because of the reaction mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reagent determines whether it reduces the ester or the ketone. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a ketone group. When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, it reduces the ester to a diol, but leaves the ketone as is? No, because LiBH4 would likely reduce the ketone as well.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via a different mechanism. Let me think about the possibility of a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, but that requires vicinal diols and involves their dehydration to form carbonyl groups. But that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic compound, but that's getting complicated.

Alternative approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but how does that form a ketone? The β-keto ester has a ketone and an ester. Reducing the ester would give a diol, but the ketone is still present. Then, perhaps the diol and the ketone undergo some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is a lactone (cyclic ester), and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then forms a six-membered ring with the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize into a six-membered ring.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are about the configuration of A and B. So the starting materials A and B are either R or S configurations of the same compound.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is R and B is S.

So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it forms the R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it forms the S product.

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material influence the product's configuration?

If the starting material is a β-keto ester with a chiral center, then the reduction would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, in the starting material, the chiral center is at position 3 (3-ethyl). So the configuration (R or S) of that chiral center would influence the configuration of the product.

When the starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry at that center would be retained or inverted, depending on the reaction.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which has a stereocenter at position 4. So the ethyl group is at position 4. The configuration (R or S) of that position depends on the starting material's configuration and the reduction conditions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) at position 3 leads to the product's configuration at position 4 being R or S.

So, the stereochemistry of the starting material is transferred to the product's stereochemistry.

But how?

Let me visualize the molecule. The starting material is a β-keto ester with a chiral center at C3 (ethyl group). Upon reduction, perhaps the ester is reduced to a diol, and then a cyclization occurs, leading to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

The configuration of the starting material would influence the position of substituents during cyclization, thus determining the configuration of the product.

If the starting material is (R) configuration, then the product would be R, and if the starting material is (S), the product would be S.

But which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) would cause which configuration?

Wait, the product from A with LiBH4 is R. The product from B with BH3 is S.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, then if A is R, the product is R. If B is S, the product is S.

So, the starting material A must be R, and starting material B must be S.

Looking at the options, which option has A as R and B as S?

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So the correct answer is D.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one using different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which exist in either (R) or (S) configurations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones. It likely reduces the β-keto ester in the starting material to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. It also likely reduces the β-keto ester to a diol, which cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

2. **Product Formation**:
   - The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry at position 4 (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reduction conditions.

3. **Stereochemical Considerations**:
   - The starting material has a chiral center at position 3 (3-ethyl). The configuration (R or S) of this center determines the stereochemistry of the product.
   - If the starting material is (R), the product will be (R). If the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

4. **Matching Reagents to Products**:
   - The reaction with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product, so the starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
   - The reaction with BH3 produces the (S)-product, so the starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - Option D specifies A as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which matches the stereochemical requirements for the products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B.

**Answer: D**
