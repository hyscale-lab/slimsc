Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting based on the given information. Both planets are Earth-like, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. 

The question says that Planet 1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet 2. Specifically, Planet 1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet 2's period is, say, P, then Planet 1's is P/3. 

They also have circular orbits, which is important because eccentricity affects transit probability, but since both are circular, I can maybe ignore that for now.

The host stars have the same radii. Planet 1's star has twice the mass of Planet 2's star. But same radius, which is interesting. Wait, same radius but different masses. So higher mass stars are usually bigger, but if their radii are the same, that might mean they're in different stages or something. But maybe that doesn't matter directly for the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the relative sizes of their orbits. The formula I recall is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a + R_s)) ), but wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star (which is the orbital separation a). Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the geometric probability of a transit is given by P = (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_s is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like, I can assume their radii are similar, so R_p is the same for both planets. Let's say R_p is the same, so it cancels out in the ratio.

So the probability is proportional to (R_s) / a. Wait, no, because the actual formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / a. Since R_p is much smaller than R_s, especially for Earth-like planets and stars, this approximates to P ≈ R_s / a.

Wait, let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the ratio of the size of the star plus planet to the distance. So the formula is P = (R_s + R_p) / a. If R_p is much smaller than R_s, then it's approximately P = R_s / a. But considering that R_p is the same for both, perhaps.

But wait, what's the relation between the semi-major axis a and the orbital period? Using Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_s + M_p) / (4π²)) * P². But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M_p is negligible. So a^3 ≈ (G M_s) * (P/(2π))^2. So a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, so a is proportional to (M_s)^(1/3) * P^(2/3). Because a = [ (G M_s )^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(2/3) ) ].

Given that, we can write a as proportional to (M_s * P²)^(1/3). 

But for the transit probability, P = (R_s + R_p) / a. So P is proportional to R_s / a, since R_p is negligible. So P ∝ R_s / a.

We have R_s same for both stars. So P ∝ 1/a. Which means, the higher a is, the lower the transit probability. So the planet with a smaller a has a higher probability.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. Let me compute a for both planets.

Given that, let me compute a for each planet.

Planet 1: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2, because the host star of Planet1 is twice as massive as that of Planet2. 

Planet1's period is P1 = P2 /3, since it's 3 times shorter.

So for each planet, a^3 = (G M_s) * (P/(2π))^2.

So a = [ (G M_s) * (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3)

So for Planet 1:

a1 = [ (G * 2 M_s2) * (P1/(2π))^2 ]^(1/3)
But P1 = P2 / 3.

So substitute P1 = P2/3:

a1 = [ (2 G M_s2) * ( (P2/3)/(2π) )^2 ]^(1/3 )

Simplify inside: (P2/(3*2π))² = (P2²) / (36 π²) )

So a1 = [ 2 G M_s2 * (P2² / 36 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2 G M_s2 P2² ) / (36 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2 G M_s2 P2² ) ]^(1/3) / (36 π²)^(1/3)
Wait, but 36 is (6^2), so 36^(1/3) is 6^(2/3). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute a1 and a2 in terms of each other.

Let me compute a1 / a2.

a2 = [ G M_s2 * (P2/(2π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ 2 * G M_s2 * (P2/(3 * 2 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )
= [ 2 G M_s2 (P2²)/(36 π^2) ) ]^(1/3 )
= [ (2 G M_s2 P2²) / (36 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ ( G M_s2 P2^2 ) / (4 π^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2 / 36 π²) ) / (1/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3) 

Wait, maybe I should factor the expressions.

Let me factor both a1 and a2.

a1 = [2 * G M_s2 * (P2/(6 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 * G M_s2 * P2²/(36 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M_s2 * P2²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/(36 π²)) / (1/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, no, I think I should write a1 as:

a1 = ( (2 G M_s2) * (P2/(6 π))^2 )^(1/3 )

= ( (2 G M_s2) * (P2^2) )/(36 π^2) ) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( ( G M_s2 ) * (P2^2) )/(4 π^2) )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2 G M_s2 * P2^2) / (36 π²) ) / ( G M_s2 P2^2/(4 π²) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, the G M_s2 P2^2 terms will cancel out.

So a1/a2 = [ (2) / (36 π²) ) * (4 π²) / 1 ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, let me compute the division inside:

(2 / 36 π²) ) / (1/(4 π²) )

= [ 2 / 36 π² ] * [ 4 π² / 1 ]

= (2 * 4 π² ) / (36 π² )

= 8 π² / 36 π² 

= 8/36 = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Which is (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Because a1 < a2, their transit probabilities are inversely proportional to a. So since a1 is smaller, the transit probability for Planet 1 is higher.

Wait, the transit probability P is proportional to R_s / a. Since R_s is the same for both, P ∝ 1/a.

So P1 / P2 = (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 ≈ 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = 1.65. So Planet1 has about 1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Options:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

So according to this, Planet 1 has a higher probability, so the researchers would observe Planet1. Which makes option C correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if a1 is smaller, then P1 is higher, so we should choose Planet1. So the correct choice is either C or D.

But let's double-check the a1/a2 calculation.

Let me recompute a1/a2.

a1 = [ (2 G M_s2) * (P2/(6 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [2 G M_s2 * P2^2/(36 π²) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M_s2 * (P2/(2 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [ G M_s2 * P2^2/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So a1^3 = 2 G M_s2 P2² / (36 π^2) 

a2^3 = G M_s2 P2² / (4 π^2 )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/(36)) * (4) ) 

Because (2 G M ... ) / (G M ...) = 2, and denominator 36 π^2, numerator 4 π^2.

Wait, wait:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 G M P^2)/(36 π^2) ) ] / [ (G M P^2)/(4 π^2) ) ]

The G M P^2 and π^2 terms cancel out.

So (2/36) / (1/4) ) = (2/36) * (4/1) ) = (8)/(36) = 2/9.

Ah, so a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

What's (2/9)^(1/3 )?

Well, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So transit probability is higher for Planet1.

So the probability ratio P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 times.

So Planet1 has about 1.65 times the probability of Planet2. So the researchers would prefer Planet1, which is option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_s}{a}
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(a\)). A smaller \(a\) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the mass of the host star \(M_s\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet 1:
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)
- Host star mass: \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\)

Substituting these values into the formula for \(a\), we find:

\[
a_1 \propto \left(2M_{s2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet 2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left(M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio of \(a_1\) to \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2M_{s2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet 1 has a smaller semi-major axis and a higher transit probability. The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet 1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet 2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet 1.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the geometric probability of a transit is given by P = (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_s is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like, I can assume their radii are similar, so R_p is the same for both planets. Let's say R_p is the same, so it cancels out in the ratio.

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M_p is negligible. So a^3 ≈ (G M_s) * (P/(2π))^2. So a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, so a is proportional to (M_s)^(1/3) * P^(2/3). Because a = [ (G M_s )^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(2/3) ) ].

Given that, we can write a as proportional to (M_s * P²)^(1/3). 

But for the transit probability, P = (R_s + R_p) / a. So P is proportional to R_s / a, since R_p is negligible. So P ∝ R_s / a.

We have R_s same for both stars. So P ∝ 1/a. Which means, the higher a is, the lower the transit probability. So the planet with a smaller a has a higher probability.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. Let me compute a for both planets.

Given that, let me compute a for each planet.

Planet 1: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2, because the host star of Planet1 is twice as massive as that of Planet2. 

Planet1's period is P1 = P2 /3, since it's 3 times shorter.

So for each planet, a^3 = (G M_s) * (P/(2π))^2.

So a = [ (G M_s) * (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3)

So for Planet 1:

a1 = [ (G * 2 M_s2) * (P1/(2π))^2 ]^(1/3)
But P1 = P2 / 3.

So substitute P1 = P2/3:

a1 = [ (2 G M_s2) * ( (P2/3)/(2π) )^2 ]^(1/3 )

Simplify inside: (P2/(3*2π))² = (P2²) / (36 π²) )

So a1 = [ 2 G M_s2 * (P2² / 36 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2 G M_s2 P2² ) / (36 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2 G M_s2 P2² ) ]^(1/3) / (36 π²)^(1/3)
Wait, but 36 is (6^2), so 36^(1/3) is 6^(2/3). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute a1 and a2 in terms of each other.

Let me compute a1 / a2.

a2 = [ G M_s2 * (P2/(2π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ 2 * G M_s2 * (P2/(3 * 2 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )
= [ 2 G M_s2 (P2²)/(36 π^2) ) ]^(1/3 )
= [ (2 G M_s2 P2²) / (36 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ ( G M_s2 P2^2 ) / (4 π^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2 / 36 π²) ) / (1/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3) 

Wait, maybe I should factor the expressions.

Let me factor both a1 and a2.

a1 = [2 * G M_s2 * (P2/(6 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 * G M_s2 * P2²/(36 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M_s2 * P2²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/(36 π²)) / (1/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, no, I think I should write a1 as:

a1 = ( (2 G M_s2) * (P2/(6 π))^2 )^(1/3 )

= ( (2 G M_s2) * (P2^2) )/(36 π^2) ) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( ( G M_s2 ) * (P2^2) )/(4 π^2) )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2 G M_s2 * P2^2) / (36 π²) ) / ( G M_s2 P2^2/(4 π²) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, the G M_s2 P2^2 terms will cancel out.

So a1/a2 = [ (2) / (36 π²) ) * (4 π²) / 1 ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, let me compute the division inside:

(2 / 36 π²) ) / (1/(4 π²) )

= [ 2 / 36 π² ] * [ 4 π² / 1 ]

= (2 * 4 π² ) / (36 π² )

= 8 π² / 36 π² 

= 8/36 = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Which is (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Because a1 < a2, their transit probabilities are inversely proportional to a. So since a1 is smaller, the transit probability for Planet 1 is higher.

Wait, the transit probability P is proportional to R_s / a. Since R_s is the same for both, P ∝ 1/a.

So P1 / P2 = (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 ≈ 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = 1.65. So Planet1 has about 1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Options:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

So according to this, Planet 1 has a higher probability, so the researchers would observe Planet1. Which makes option C correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if a1 is smaller, then P1 is higher, so we should choose Planet1. So the correct choice is either C or D.

But let's double-check the a1/a2 calculation.

Let me recompute a1/a2.

a1 = [ (2 G M_s2) * (P2/(6 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [2 G M_s2 * P2^2/(36 π²) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M_s2 * (P2/(2 π))^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [ G M_s2 * P2^2/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So a1^3 = 2 G M_s2 P2² / (36 π^2) 

a2^3 = G M_s2 P2² / (4 π^2 )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/(36)) * (4) ) 

Because (2 G M ... ) / (G M ...) = 2, and denominator 36 π^2, numerator 4 π^2.

Wait, wait:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 G M P^2)/(36 π^2) ) ] / [ (G M P^2)/(4 π^2) ) ]

The G M P^2 and π^2 terms cancel out.

So (2/36) / (1/4) ) = (2/36) * (4/1) ) = (8)/(36) = 2/9.

Ah, so a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

What's (2/9)^(1/3 )?

Well, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So transit probability is higher for Planet1.

So the probability ratio P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 times.

So Planet1 has about 1.65 times the probability of Planet2. So the researchers would prefer Planet1, which is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_s}{a}
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(a\)). A smaller \(a\) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the mass of the host star \(M_s\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet 1:
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)
- Host star mass: \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\)

Substituting these values into the formula for \(a\), we find:

\[
a_1 \propto \left(2M_{s2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet 2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left(M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio of \(a_1\) to \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2M_{s2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet 1 has a smaller semi-major axis and a higher transit probability. The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet 1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet 2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet 1.
