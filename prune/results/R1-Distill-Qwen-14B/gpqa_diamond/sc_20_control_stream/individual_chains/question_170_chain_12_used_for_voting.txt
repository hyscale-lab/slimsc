Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for a given electron spin state. Hmm, let's see. I remember that expectation values involve the operator and the state vector. 

The state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector. I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors because electrons have spin-1/2, so their spin states are in a two-dimensional space. 

The operator for S_y, I think, is given by sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin operators. So sigma_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the S_y operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the expectation value of an operator is given by the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator and then by the state vector. So mathematically, it's <ψ| S_y |ψ>. 

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's (3i, 4), so as a column vector, it would be [3i; 4]. To compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ. 

First, I'll compute ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Next, I need to compute S_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [ 0, -i ], [i, 0 ] ]

Now, let's compute ψ† * S_y. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, multiplied by S_y, which is 2x2. The result will be a 1x2 matrix.

Multiplying [ -3i, 4 ] with S_y:

First element: (-3i)*(0) + 4*(i) = 0 +4i =4i? Wait, no, wait, I'm doing a row vector multiplied by a matrix, each element in the row times the corresponding column, but I think I might have jumbled the indices. Let me do it step by step.

Wait, matrix multiplication: row times column.

So first element will be (-3i)*0 + 4*i. Because S_y's first row is [0, -i], but wait no, S_y is a 2x2 matrix. ψ† is [a, b], multiplied by S_y which is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. So the multiplication is:

a*0 + b*i for the first component? Wait, no. Wait, when you multiply a 1x2 row vector by a 2x2 matrix, each element of the resulting row vector (1x2) is the sum of the products of the row's elements multiplied by the corresponding column elements of the matrix.

So S_y has columns. So first column is [0; i], and second column is [-i; 0].

So ψ† * S_y is [ (-3i)*0 + 4*i, (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. 

The first element of the resulting vector is ψ† multiplied by the first column of S_y.

So first element: (-3i) * 0 + 4 * i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0.

Wait, (-3i)*(-i) is 3i^2, which is 3*(-1) = -3. Because i^2=-1.

So the second element is (-3i)*(-i) = 3i^2 = -3.

So the resulting vector after ψ† * S_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we need to multiply this by ψ, which is [3i;4]. So the result is [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i;4].

Wait, that's the inner product, so it's 4i*(3i) + (-3)*(4).

Let me compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's double-check the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S_y|ψ> first, and then take the inner product with ψ.

Let me try that approach.

Compute S_y multiplied by |ψ>:

S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * [ [0*(-3i) + (-i)*4], [i*(-3i) + 0*4] ] ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix multiplication is:

S_y is a 2x2 matrix, |ψ> is 2x1. So the result is another 2x1 vector.

Let me write it out:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*3i +0 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute each component correctly.

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So when you multiply S_y by |ψ> = [3i;4], you do:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)*(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y |ψ> is (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ].

Now, the expectation value is ψ† * S_y |ψ> .

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the inner product is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ] (each component multiplied and summed).

So:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = ?

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term:4*(-3) = -12.

So the sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

But wait, S_y is multiplied by ħ/2, so the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) ?

Wait, wait. Because when we compute S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So the entire calculation would be: ψ† S_y ψ = ψ† (ħ/2 sigma_y) ψ = (ħ/2) * ψ† sigma_y ψ.

So earlier, when I computed the inner product without the (ħ/2), I got -24. So the expectation is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in terms of hbar over 25, etc. So I must have made a mistake somewhere because my answer is -12 ħ, but the options have denominators like 25.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the inner product.

Wait, let me go back. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial matrix multiplication or the state vector.

Wait, the state is (3i,4). So the vector is [3i,4]^T.

So S_y is [ [0, -i], [i,0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So S_y |ψ> is (ħ/2) * [ (0*3i + (-i)*4 ), (i *3i + 0 *4 ) ].

First component: 0*3i =0, (-i)*4 =-4i. So 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*3i =3i²= -3. 0*4=0. So -3.

So S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ].

Now, the expectation value is ψ† (S_y |ψ> ). ψ† is [3i^*, 4^*] = [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† S_y |ψ> = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, no, no, the vector is [ -4i, -3 ], and I'm taking the dot product with [ -3i, 4 ].

So:

(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3) ?

Wait, (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 -12 = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (-24)*(ħ/2) = (-12 ħ).

But the options don't have -12 ħ. They have -12 ħ/25, 12 ħ/25, etc.

Hmmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot to normalize the state vector!

Ah, right! The state vector must be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities don't add up to one.

Wait, so the state given is (3i,4). Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5).

Wait, but wait, the problem says the state is (3i,4). Does that mean it's already normalized? Because |3i|^2 + |4|^2 is 25, so the norm is 5. So to make it a unit vector, each component is divided by 5.

So perhaps I should use the normalized state for the expectation value.

Oh wait, wait, the expectation value is calculated using the normalized state. So I think I forgot to normalize the state in my previous steps.

So let's correct that.

The state |ψ> is (3i,4), which has a norm squared of 3^2 +4^2 =25 (since |3i|=3, |4|=4). So |ψ> is not normalized. The normalized state is |ψ>/5.

Therefore, when calculating the expectation value, I should use |ψ>/5. Because the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ> divided by <ψ|ψ>, which is 25.

Wait, wait. The expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ). Because the state might not be normalized.

So ψ is [3i,4], ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

Compute ψ† ψ: (-3i)(3i) +4*4.

(-3i)(3i) = -9i² = -9*(-1)=9.

4*4=16.

So 9+16=25. So the normalization factor is 25.

So the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) /25.

Earlier, ψ† S_y ψ was (-24), right? So (-24) * (ħ/2) /25.

So:

(-24 * ħ/2 ) /25 = (-12 ħ) /25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25. Looking at the options:

Option A is -12 hbar/25. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I did all the steps correctly.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate the ψ† S_y ψ for the normalized state.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the normalized state.

So the normalized state is |ψ> = (3i/5, 4/5).

Compute S_y |ψ>.

S_y is (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So sigma_y |ψ> is [0*(-3i/5) + (-i)(4/5), i*(-3i/5) + 0*(4/5)].

First component: 0 + (-i)(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(-3i/5) = (-3i²)/5 = (-3*(-1))/5 = 3/5.

So sigma_y |ψ> is [ (-4i/5), (3/5) ].

Then, S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5), (3/5) ].

Now, compute ψ† S_y |ψ>.

ψ† is [ (-3i/5), (4/5) ].

Dot product:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) + (4/5) * (3/5).

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i^2 = -12. Divided by (5*5)=25: 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Wait, wait:

[ (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) ] = (12 i²) /25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

[ (4/5) * (3/5) ] = 12/25.

So sum is -12/25 +12/25 =0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply the expectation value is zero. But that doesn't match the earlier result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait wait, let me recompute this part.

Wait, sigma_y |ψ> for the normalized state:

Wait, |ψ> = [3i/5,4/5]^T.

sigma_y |ψ> = [0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) +0*(4/5) ].

First component: 0 + (-i *4/5) = (-4i/5).

Second component: i*(3i/5) = (3i²)/5 = (-3)/5.

So sigma_y |ψ> = [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ].

So S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ].

Now, ψ† is [ (-3i/5), (4/5) ].

Compute the inner product:

[ (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) ) + (4/5)*(-3/5) ]

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1)= -12. So (-3i/5)(-4i/5)= (-12)/25.

Second term: (4/5)(-3/5) = (-12)/25.

So sum is (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24/25).

Multiply by (ħ/2), the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches the earlier result. So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25, which is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for the given spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Steps:
1. **Spin Operator**: The operator \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad \text{where } \sigma_y = 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given state vector is \( \psi = (3i, 4) \). The norm of \( \psi \) is:
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5}(3i, 4) = \left(\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right).
   \]

3. **Compute \( S_y \psi_{\text{normalized}} \)**:
   Using \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), we compute:
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi_{\text{normalized}} = 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \frac{3i}{5} \\
   \frac{4}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}
   =
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + (-i) \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\
   i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + 0 \cdot \frac{4}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}
   =
   \begin{pmatrix}
   -\frac{4i}{5} \\
   -\frac{3}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   S_y \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
   -\frac{4i}{5} \\
   -\frac{3}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute the Expectation Value**:
   The expectation value is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \psi_{\text{normalized}}.
   \]
   First, compute \( \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \):
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger = \left(-\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right).
   \]
   Then, compute the inner product:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) \right].
   \]
   - First term:
     \[
     \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}.
     \]
   - Second term:
     \[
     \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = -\frac{12}{25}.
     \]
   Adding these:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
