Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity technique measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect the shift in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So the key here is figuring out how the Doppler shifts relate to the orbital periods.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7. I think the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star, right? Because a bigger shift means the star is moving faster. So the formula for radial velocity (RV) method probably relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ) )

But since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_star. So 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies. Let me think, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3). Because the other terms might involve P in the denominator.

Wait, I think another way. The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period P and the mass. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but maybe a simpler approach. Since both stars have the same mass (same M), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p1 ≈ M_p2), the only varying factors would be P and the velocity amplitude K.

The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity K. So, K1 = 5, K2 =7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? Because the same formula for K involves P. Let's see, K is proportional to (M_p) (1/(M_star)) )^(1/3) * (1/(P) )^(1/3). Wait, because K = (v) and v is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(P) )^(1/3).

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the formula for K. The precise formula is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π(1 - e²)) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0 for circular orbits, and M_p << M_star, it simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is same for both planets and M_star same, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), because K2 = (1/(P2^(1/3))) * const, and K1= (1/(P1^(1/3))) * const.

Wait, wait, let's get it right. Let me think again. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So P ∝ (1/K)³.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1? Or wait, if K increases, then P^(1/3) decreases, so P decreases. So a larger K means shorter orbital period.

Wait, so P is inversely proportional to K^3. So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let me verify the math. Let me write K as proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), which implies P ∝ 1/K^3.

So for two planets, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3 and P2 ∝ 1/K2^3. So the ratio P2/P1 is (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Hmm, but wait, let's plug in numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1 =5, K2=7 → K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ ?

0.7^3 is 0.343. 0.714 is a bit more. (5/7 is approximately 0.714286.)

But let's compute it: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means planet #2's period is shorter.

But wait, the question is asking: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So, P2/P1 = 0.364 → which is about 0.36 times. So it's shorter, which is 0.36 times the other period.

So planet #2's period is shorter, making the ratio less than 1.

Looking at the options, the only option around 0.36 is option A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I might have mixed up P1 and P2.

Wait, the K values: planet #1 has K1=5, planet #2 K2=7. So K2 is larger than K1. From the formula, P is inversely proportional to K^3. So if K2 is bigger, P2 is smaller.

So P2 = (K1/K2)³ * P1.

Wait, so P2 is (5/7)^3 of P1. So P2 is about 0.364 * P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1, so the number of times longer is 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter and not longer.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if planet #2's period is 0.36 times planet #1's, then it's not longer. So the answer must be about 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be the factor by which P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is how many times longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, meaning P2 is shorter. But maybe I'm getting confused with the wording.

Wait, let me think again. The question says, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's 0.36 times as long. So it's 36% the length of planet #1's period. So planet #2's period is shorter; it's 0.36 times as long.

So in terms of how many times longer is P2 than P1, it's 0.36 times—so the answer is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer would be option A.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is proportional to the star's velocity amplitude \( K \). For circular orbits and stars of equal mass, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), or equivalently, \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) (planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) (planet #2),

the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

From the options provided:
- A) ~0.36,
- B) ~1.40,
- C) ~1.96,
- D) ~0.85,

the correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), because K2 = (1/(P2^(1/3))) * const, and K1= (1/(P1^(1/3))) * const.

Wait, wait, let's get it right. Let me think again. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So P ∝ (1/K)³.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1? Or wait, if K increases, then P^(1/3) decreases, so P decreases. So a larger K means shorter orbital period.

Wait, so P is inversely proportional to K^3. So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let me verify the math. Let me write K as proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), which implies P ∝ 1/K^3.

So for two planets, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3 and P2 ∝ 1/K2^3. So the ratio P2/P1 is (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Hmm, but wait, let's plug in numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1 =5, K2=7 → K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ ?
