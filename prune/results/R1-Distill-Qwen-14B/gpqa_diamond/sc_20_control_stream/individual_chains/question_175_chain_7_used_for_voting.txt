Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The question is about the power radiated at a certain angle and the form of the function f.

Wait, the problem states the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. Radiation-wise, I think the radiation pattern would depend on the angle theta from the z-axis. 

The question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees. And also, what's the form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle, depending on lambda and theta.

I recall that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum along the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and decreases as you move towards the poles. Oh wait, actually, no, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the axis, so theta=90 degrees is the maximum. But wait, this is about a spheroid charge distribution oscillating. So maybe it's an electric dipole or something else.

Wait, but in general, the radiation power goes as sin^2(theta) for a dipole. Because the dipole's radiation pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum is at 90 degrees, where sin(theta)=1, so that's when the power is maximum.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So when theta is 30 degrees, what fraction of A is that?

Wait, if at theta=90 degrees, the power is maximum. So the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) multiplied by some function of lambda. But wait, the function f is in the radiation zone, so I think the far field. The radiated power per unit solid angle (directivity) for a dipole is (3/4 pi) * (sin^2 theta), but wait, that's the directivity which is the radiation pattern.

Wait, but the question is about the form of f and the fraction at 30 degrees. So the function f is f(lambda, theta), which is the power per unit solid angle. So I think that f would have a dependence on lambda squared or so, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dependencies.

Wait, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The power is proportional to (acceleration)^2, but in the far field, the fields depend on 1/r, so the power (which is energy per unit time) might have a certain dependence on the frequency.

Wait, another thought: the peak power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the charge acceleration. But the question is about the form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle. So that function probably depends on both lambda and theta.

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum at theta = 90 degrees and goes as sin^2(theta). So the function f(theta) should be proportional to sin^2(theta), but also, the total power depends on the frequency. Because the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength, but I'm not sure about the scaling.

Wait, the maximum power is A. So f(theta, lambda) would be (some function) multiplied by sin^2(theta), perhaps, and multiplied by a term involving lambda. Let's think about the dependence on lambda.

Hmm, the power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (e^2 a^2 )/(6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ) * (sin^2(theta)) ) * (omega^4), something like that. But wait, wait, omega is 2 pi c / lambda. So omega^4 would be ( (2 pi c)/lambda )^4. So that's (pi^4 c^4)/(lambda^4). So the power P is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But wait, the function f is power per unit solid angle. So if the total power is proportional to 1/lambda^4, then the function f(theta) would also have a 1/lambda^4 dependence, because the solid angle is integrated over 4 pi steradians to get the total power.

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta, lambda) = (some constant) * (sin^2 theta) * (1/lambda^4). Because the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles, which would be 4 pi times the average of sin^2 theta over the sphere. Wait, the average of sin^2 theta over a sphere is 2/3. So the total power A would be f_avg * 4 pi, where f_avg is (3A)/(4 pi) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The power per unit solid angle is the radiation intensity U. For a dipole, U is proportional to sin^2 theta, and the total power is the integral of U over all solid angles, which is 4 pi times the average value. But how does U depend on lambda?

Well, the Larmor formula for power is P = (e² a²)/(6 π ε₀ c³) * (sin²θ). But a is the acceleration, which depends on the frequency. If the charge is executing simple harmonic motion, a = ω² x_max, where x_max is the amplitude. So a is proportional to ω².

Wait, but ω is 2π c / λ. So a is proportional to (1/λ²) * something. Wait, but let me think about the dependence of the power on λ. The power P is proportional to a², which is proportional to ω^4, which is (1/λ^4). So P is proportional to 1/λ^4.

But the function f is U = P / (4 pi), because the total solid angle is 4 pi. Wait, no. Wait, the power per unit solid angle is U = P / (4 pi) × (something). Wait, no, U is P integrated over solid angle. Wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the total power is the integral over all solid angles of U dΩ. So U is the power per unit solid angle. So if P is the total power, U is P/(4 pi) times something that depends on theta.

Wait, no, because U varies with theta. So for a dipole, U is U_0 sin^2 theta, where U_0 is the maximum intensity (at theta=90 degrees). So the total power is the integral of U over all solid angles. So integrating U over Ω gives 4 pi * (U_0 / 4 pi ) * ∫ sin^2 theta dΩ. Wait, no, let me correct.

Wait, U is a function of theta. So integrating U over all solid angles would be ∫ (U_0 sin² theta) dΩ. The integral of sin² theta over the sphere is 4 pi times the average of sin² theta. What's the average? The average of sin² theta over a sphere is 2/3. So the integral becomes U_0 * 4 pi * (2/3) = (8/3) pi U_0. But the total power P is equal to this integral, so P = (8/3) pi U_0. Therefore, U_0 = (3 P) / (8 pi).

Wait, but for a dipole, the maximum intensity U_0 is ( (e^2 a^2) / (48 pi^3 epsilon_0 c^3) ) * (omega^4) ), I think. But perhaps I'm getting into the nitty-gritty here, which might not be necessary for the question.

The important points are: the maximum power is at theta=90 degrees, so at theta=30 degrees, the intensity is lower. The function f has a sin^2 theta dependence, so at 30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin²(theta)=0.25. Therefore, the intensity at 30 degrees is 0.25 times the maximum intensity.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that is radiated at theta=30 degrees. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum intensity U_max is at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity at 30 degrees is U = U_max * sin^2(30) = U_max * (0.5)^2 = U_max * 0.25. 

But the total power is the integral of U over all solid angles. So when we're at a specific theta, the power in a small solid angle dΩ around that theta is U(theta) dΩ. So the fraction of the maximum power A that's at theta=30 degrees is [U(theta=30) * (dΩ) ] / A. But wait, I'm not looking at a differential, but the total power at theta=30. That doesn't make sense because power is integrated over all solid angles. So perhaps the question is instead asking, for the maximum possible power (A), what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees, but that's not the case. Because the maximum intensity U is at theta=90, but the total power is the sum over all angles.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question states: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,"

Ah, so A is the maximum power radiated. So perhaps the maximum power occurs when the charge distribution is at a certain point in its oscillation, but that's probably not. Wait, no, the maximum power is A, which is the maximum possible, so perhaps the function f is such that the maximum value is A. So the fraction of A that's radiated at theta=30 is the value of f(theta=30, lambda) divided by A, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: The power radiated per unit solid angle is f(theta, lambda). The total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So the maximum value of f is A, which occurs at theta=90 degrees. So at theta=30 degrees, f(theta=30) = A * sin²(30) = A * (1/2)^2 = A/4. So the fraction is (A/4) / A = 1/4. 

Wait, but wait, no. Because the function f might have a dependence on lambda as well. Oh, right, the question says f is a function of lambda and theta. So f = f(lambda, theta) = something * sin^2(theta) * lambda^-n. So the form of f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) times 1/lambda to some power.

So the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta=30 would be (f(theta=30) ) / (maximum f). Since maximum is at theta=90, f_max = f(lambda, 90) = something * 1 * lambda^-n.

So f(theta=30) = something * sin^2(30) * lambda^-n = something * (1/4) * lambda^-n.

Therefore, f(theta=30)/f_max = (1/4). So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but that's the fraction of the maximum intensity. But the question is about the fraction of the total maximum power A. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Because the maximum power A is the total power when considering all angles, so perhaps the maximum A is the sum over all angles. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The maximum intensity (power per unit solid angle) is A. So the maximum occurs at theta=90, so f(theta=90) = A. At theta=30, f(theta=30) = A * sin²(30) = A * (1/2)^2 = A/4. So the power per unit solid angle at theta=30 is A/4. But the question is what fraction of the maximum power (A) is radiated at theta=30.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the total power radiated is the integral of f over all solid angles. But the maximum value of f is A. So the fraction at theta=30 would be (f(theta=30) ) / (f_max) ) = (A/4)/A ) = 1/4.

So the fraction of the maximum intensity is 1/4. But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused between intensity and power.

Wait, wait, the maximum power A is the total power, which is the integral of f over all solid angles. So the maximum power (A) is the sum of all the power per unit solid angle across all angles. So the fraction radiated at theta=30 would be (f(theta=30) * dOmega) / A. But dOmega is an infinitesimal, so that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking, for each angle, the intensity is f(theta), and the maximum intensity is A. So the fraction of the maximum intensity is 1/4, i.e., at theta=30, the intensity is 25% of the maximum.

So the answer for the fraction is 1/4. Now, what about the form of f? The function f has a dependence on lambda. From earlier, I think f is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Because the power radiated is P ~ 1/lambda^4. And since f is the power per unit solid angle, which is proportional to (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2(theta). So the possible form of f would be lambda^(-4) multiplied by sin^2(theta). So looking at the options.

Looking at the options, option C has 1/4 as the fraction and lambda^-4 form. Option B has 1/4 and lambda^-3, which I don't think is correct.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4. So the answer would be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle $\theta$ (measured from the z-axis) and the wavelength $\lambda$. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ and the functional form of $f(\lambda, \theta)$, which represents the power per unit solid angle.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern Dependence on $\theta$:**  
   For an oscillating charge distribution, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to $\sin^2(\theta)$. This means the intensity is maximum at $\theta = 90^\circ$ (perpendicular to the z-axis) and decreases as $\theta$ approaches $0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$. At $\theta = 30^\circ$, the intensity is reduced by a factor of $\sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$ compared to the maximum intensity.

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at $\theta = 30^\circ$:**  
   The maximum power $A$ corresponds to the total radiated power, which is the integral of $f(\lambda, \theta)$ over all solid angles. The fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is the ratio of the intensity at $\theta = 30^\circ$ to the maximum intensity. Since the intensity at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$ of the maximum intensity, the fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$.

3. **Dependence of $f(\lambda, \theta)$ on $\lambda$:**  
   The total radiated power is proportional to $1/\lambda^4$, as derived from the Larmor formula and the dependence of the acceleration on frequency. Since $f(\lambda, \theta)$ is the power per unit solid angle, it also has a $1/\lambda^4$ dependence. Combining this with the $\sin^2(\theta)$ dependence, $f(\lambda, \theta)$ takes the form $f \propto \sin^2(\theta) \cdot \lambda^{-4}$.

4. **Matching with Options:**  
   - Option A: $1/2$ fraction and $\lambda^{-4}$ form. Incorrect, as the fraction is $1/4$, not $1/2$.  
   - Option B: $1/4$ fraction and $\lambda^{-3}$ form. Incorrect, as the fraction is correct, but the $\lambda^{-3}$ dependence is wrong.  
   - Option C: $1/4$ fraction and $\lambda^{-4}$ form. Correct, as both the fraction and the functional form match the analysis.  
   - Option D: $3/4$ fraction and $\lambda^{-6}$ form. Incorrect, as neither the fraction nor the functional form matches.

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$, and the functional form of $f(\lambda, \theta)$ is $\lambda^{-4}$.
