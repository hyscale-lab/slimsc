Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through it. So the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Because at such high speeds, we have to account for relativistic effects.

Let me remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects as observed from the same frame. Wait, wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So I should subtract them, but I'm a bit confused about the order. Wait, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m), what's the speed of the second (3m) astronaut?

Wait no, in the problem statement, it says "relative speed" between them. I think it's the speed of one relative to the other, regardless of direction. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, the relative speed would be how fast B is moving with respect to A's frame.

Wait, but actually, in relativity, the relative velocity depends on which frame you're considering. So if I'm the first astronaut (A) moving at 0.6c, and I see the second astronaut (B) moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from my frame, how fast is B moving relative to me?

Wait, no. Both are moving in the same direction, but their speeds are different. So from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c), but that's negative. But since we take magnitude, it's 0.1c? But that seems too simplistic because relativity complicates things.

Wait no, because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract like that. I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me think. The formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²). So u is the speed of B in the lab frame, and v is the speed of A in the lab frame. Or wait, wait, I might have it the other way around.

Wait, the formula for the relative speed of B from A's frame is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of B in the lab frame, and v is the speed of A in the lab frame. Wait, no, because from A's frame, the speed of B would be (u' = (B's speed in lab - A's speed in lab) / (1 - (B_speed * A_speed)/(c²))).

Wait, let me get this right. The lab frame is where both are moving. Let's say in the lab, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So in A's frame, the speed of B would be u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is B's speed in lab (0.5c), and v is A's speed in lab (0.6c). Wait, no, wait. If I'm moving at v, and I observe another object moving at u, then the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, from A's frame, B is moving at u = 0.5c, and A is moving at v=0.6c? No, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of frame transformations. Let me try to compute the relative velocity of B as seen from A's frame. So the lab frame is where both are moving. A is moving at v = 0.6c, B at u = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So in A's frame, B's velocity would be u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, so plugging in u=0.5c, v=0.6c.

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Simplify numerator: (-0.1c) / denominator.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates direction, so the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So that's one part, the relative velocity v_rel is 0.14c, which would match options C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 =1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says 5.96 mc², and option D says 5 mc². So option C's energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches.

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. Here's the analysis:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.5c\) (speed of the second astronaut in the lab frame) and \(v = 0.6c\) (speed of the first astronaut in the lab frame). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, so the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For each astronaut, we calculate their energy separately and then sum them.

#### First Astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. Here's the analysis:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.5c\) (speed of the second astronaut in the lab frame) and \(v = 0.6c\) (speed of the first astronaut in the lab frame). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, so the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For each astronaut, we calculate their energy separately and then sum them.

#### First Astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
