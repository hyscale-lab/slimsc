Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves several reactions and spectroscopy data, so I'll need to break it down each part.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure with multiple cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane framework.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking of elimination reactions. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe a dehydrohalogenation happens. But I should think about what kind of structure that would produce. Adamantane is pretty rigid, so the positions of the Br atoms matter. If it's 1,3-dibromo, heating with KOH might lead to a double elimination, forming a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is all single bonds, right? So the elimination would form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but wait, 1,3 are not adjacent, so elimination would be possible? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a new structure. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might lose two HBr molecules when treated with a base. If it's adjacent bromines, but wait, 1 and 3 positions... perhaps they're on adjacent carbons, but not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between 1 and 2 carbons, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. So maybe each bromide undergoes elimination separately, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a ring-opening or some other structural change.

Looking at the product's NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. The IR peak at around 1720 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But wait, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent, but maybe some elimination followed by oxidation? Or perhaps the base deprotonates something, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: when dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they form epoxides, but only if it's a cyclic dihalide, like 1,2-dibromoethane would form ethylene oxide. But in adamantane, maybe the structure allows for such a ring formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that seems unlikely here.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Hmm. Let me think about the possible products. Another possibility is that each bromide leaves as Br-, and the base induces a coupling or ring-opening. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines.

Wait, KOH in such reactions could deprotonate, leading to elimination of HBr. Since the starting material has two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur. Let's say each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br. Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions in adamantane. So maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon? Because adamantane has multiple bridgehead carbons.

Wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone. So after reaction, maybe a ketone is formed. How could that happen? Maybe the base causes an elimination to form a carbene, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates and then a neighboring group participates. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes an E2 elimination occurs, leading to an alkene. But if the base is in excess, perhaps further reaction happens. Alternatively, if it's a dihalide that's not vicinal, but perhaps after two eliminations, maybe a conjugated diene is formed. But how does that give a carbonyl?

Wait, another possibility: if the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then loses Br- to form a carbonyl group. Wait, that would require adjacent Br and H. Let me think: maybe each bromide is in a position where elimination can form a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and upon elimination, a carbonyl group forms. For example, if a bridgehead carbon has Br and adjacent to it is another bridgehead, then elimination could form a ketone.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so each bridgehead is a carbon attached to three other carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on positions that are each attached to three other carbons.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, but how? Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from an adjacent bridgehead, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each bridgehead would lose HBr and form a ketone.

Wait, but if both Br atoms are eliminated, perhaps two ketones are formed. But that seems unlikely because the product's NMR doesn't show multiple carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe one of the Br's is eliminated to form a carbonyl, and the other is just eliminated as HBr, but that would require only one carbonyl.

Hmm, another possibility: the product is a diketone. But the IR would show a strong peak for two carbonyls, but the data shows only one peak at 1720. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone and some other structure.

Wait, looking at the NMR data. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where an alcohol or maybe an ether or a carbonyl group adjacent to something else might appear. Wait, 4.79 is downfield, perhaps an -OH group? But that's usually broader, unless it's an alcohol that's been deuterated, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons. So maybe it's not an -OH. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide proton? No, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe a geminal diol, but that would be a broad peak.

Wait, another thought: if the product has a ketone and some sort of diol or ether structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Let's think about the structure. If each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, then we'd have a 1,3-diketone. But the IR would show two peaks around 1720, but the data shows only one. So perhaps only one ketone is formed. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows 10H in the region of 2.41-2.23. That's around where methylene groups adjacent to carbonyls might appear. For example, in cyclohexanone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are around 2.2-2.4 ppm. So maybe there are 10H in that region, which would correspond to 5 methylene groups (each CH2). Wait, no. 10 H would be 5 CH2 groups or 10 H from something else.

Wait, let's think about adamantane. Adamantane has 12 carbons, all in a rigid structure. If two of them are replaced by carbonyl groups, the structure would change. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single carbonyl group with some branching.

Wait, another possible reaction: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, it might undergo a double elimination, losing two equivalents of HBr and forming a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit the data. So maybe not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but IR for epoxides usually have peaks around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretch. The given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbocation, and a neighboring Br leaves, forming a double bond and then a ring expansion or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an ether or an alcohol. The 1.94 ppm (2H) is more upfield, perhaps a CH2 that's less deshielded, maybe in a more rigid structure.

Wait, the product is after reaction with KOH, which is a strong base. Maybe it's an alcohol. Wait, but how? If two Br's are replaced by OH groups. Then, 1,3-diol adamantane. But how would the NMR look? The OH protons would be broad, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons. So maybe the OH groups are not part of the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's say, one of the Br's is replaced by a ketone group. Then, the adjacent CH2 groups would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm. So maybe in the NMR, the 10H in that region are from five CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but if it's a single ketone, how many CH2 groups would be adjacent? Let's think: each ketone is on a bridgehead of adamantane. The bridgehead carbons are connected to three other carbons. So if one bridgehead is a carbonyl, the adjacent carbons would each have CH2 groups connected to it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the IR absorbance. 1720 cm-1 is typical for a ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone, with the Br replaced by a carbonyl. So 1,3-diketone? No, because the IR would likely show two peaks if it's a diketone. Alternatively, perhaps only one Br is converted into a ketone, and the other is just eliminated, but that would leave another Br, which isn't in the product. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a single ketone and a diol? No, because the IR peak is only at 1720. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol. But the IR doesn't fit for an alcohol. Wait, unless it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but the peak would be around 3300 for OH. The IR data given is at 1720, so not an alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. But why would KOH form an ester? That reaction usually needs acid catalysis. Hmm, perhaps not.

Another thought: perhaps the product has a carbonyl group and some sort of geminal diol. Wait, but KOH is a base, maybe it deprotonates something. Or maybe it leads to a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that would require an epoxide to be present first, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, another angle: the NMR spectrum. Let's list the peaks:

- 4.79 (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)

So, the 2H at 4.79 could be a CH2 next to an electronegative group. The 10H in the 2.2-2.4 region are likely from CH2 groups adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 in a less deshielded environment, perhaps in a more rigid structure.

Wait, if the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane, then each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups. But the NMR shows 10H in that region. How many CH2 groups would be adjacent? Each ketone would have three adjacent carbons. For each ketone, maybe two CH2 groups adjacent. So for two ketones, that's four CH2 groups, which would account for 8 H. Plus, the remaining two H could be from another part of the structure.

Wait, but 1.94 (2H) could be for a CH2 group that's part of a bridge. So maybe the structure has two ketone groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups, and another CH2 bridge elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone, and the other Br is still present. But then, the IR would show Br absorption, which is usually around 600 cm-1. But the data doesn't mention that, so perhaps both Br's are gone.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a diepoxide. No, because IR for epoxides is around 1250 cm-1, and the data has 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl IR. So I'm back to thinking that it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single ketone. Let's say, only one Br is converted to a ketone, and the other Br is eliminated as HBr. But then, why would both Br's not react? Maybe the 1,3 positions are such that only one elimination is possible due to steric reasons.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone and an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps looking for a reaction where two bromides are removed and replaced by a carbonyl group. Maybe it's a double elimination with each Br being replaced by an oxygen, but how?

Another angle: the product is a ketone. So the structure after KOH treatment is a ketone. Then, product 1 is a ketone.

Moving to the next step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol or an alcohol, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination or alkoxylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide) might lead to some kind of enol ether formation or another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but for that, we usually need an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo an Aldol condensation, but that typically requires heat and a base, which might not fit here as Al(i-Pr)3 is a Lewis acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If product 1 is 1,3-diol adamantane, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to a reaction forming an epoxide. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(i-Pr)3 is acting as a dehydrating agent, leading to an ether formation. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think. If product 1 is a diol, then when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, it might form an epoxide. But that's typically done with an acid catalyst and a diol, like making an epoxide from a diol via acid catalysis. So perhaps product 2 is an epoxide.

Wait, but the first product's NMR didn't show any protons around 3-4 ppm, which is typical for epoxide protons. So maybe product 2 is an epoxide, but the NMR data for product 3 is what's being asked, so perhaps I need to proceed.

Assuming product 2 is an epoxide, then the next step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an epoxide would typically break the epoxide ring. Wait, no, ozone is used for cleaving double bonds. Oh wait, no, ozonolysis is for double bonds, not epoxides. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it. But product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(i-Pr)3.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Then, product 2 would be something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (light yellow solid). NMR and IR suggest a ketone.

Step 2: product 1 heated with excess Al(i-Pr)3 â product 2.

Step 3: product 2 treated with ozone at -78Â°C, then dimethylsulfide added â product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding exchangeables).

So, let's try to figure out each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane â product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, as the IR suggests. So, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but how? Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane â when treated with KOH, each Br may leave as Br-, but that would require two eliminations. Alternatively, perhaps one of the Br is eliminated as HBr, and the other forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, each bromide is on a bridgehead, so when the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, the bromide leaves as Br-, forming a carbonyl.

So, each bridgehead Br would form a carbonyl, leading to a 1,3-diketone. But the IR shows a single peak at 1720, which would suggest one ketone. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the Br's is converted into a ketone, and the other remains as a Br. But then, the IR would show a Br peak, which isn't mentioned. So perhaps both Br's are eliminated, but how to form a ketone?

Wait, another possibility: the base causes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated dienone. But that might result in two carbonyl groups, leading to two IR peaks. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone and some other structure. Wait, maybe the product is a cycloketone or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a tricyclic structure with a ketone. I'm getting stuck on this part, but perhaps I can proceed and see if the later steps make sense.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, let's say 1-ketoadamantane.

Step 2: product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3. Al(i-Pr)3 is a Lewis acid, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts, but since adamantane lacks an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for acetylation or other alkylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If it's 1-ketoadamantane, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enol formation. Maybe the Lewis acid coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen, making the enol more reactive. But I'm not sure what reaction would occur next.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(i-Pr)3 is a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is an alcohol (like 1,3-diol adamantane), then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to elimination of water, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

So, let's retrace.

Product 1: 1,3-diol adamantane (if the KOH caused both Br's to be replaced by OH groups). But wait, the IR for product 1 shows 1720, which is a carbonyl, not an alcohol. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but how would that happen with two Br's. Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR would show around 1250 cm-1, not 1720.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's think of the first reaction as forming a ketone and a diol. But that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually higher, around 2800 cm-1 for the C-H stretch. Wait, no, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a single ketone, and the other Br is still present. But that's unlikely because KOH would probably eliminate both Br's.

Alternatively, perhaps one Br is eliminated as HBr, and the other is converted into a carbonyl group. So, the product would have a ketone and a Br. But then, the IR would show a Br stretch around 600 cm-1, which isn't mentioned, so perhaps that's not the case.

This is taking a while, but perhaps I should proceed with what I have.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is formed by treatment with Al(i-Pr)3. Maybe the ketone is converted into an enol ether or undergoes some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but then product 1's IR would be around 3300 for OH, but it's at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups. Then, in product 3, the NMR would show protons adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, but let's try to figure out product 2.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then ozonolysis wouldn't affect that, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a diol. Then ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into carbonyls. But the first step involved KOH, which might form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the first step is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, product 1. Then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 could lead to some kind of addition or rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled, so perhaps I should look for the answer based on the ozonolysis step.

In the third step, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. This is a standard ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (with dimethylsulfide, which is a mild reductant), leading to the formation of carbonyl groups from the ozonide.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

Now, the question is about the most deshielded proton in product 3. The most deshielded proton is likely adjacent to the carbonyl group, as proximity to electronegative atoms deshields the proton.

In the NMR, the coupling pattern arises from neighboring protons. So, the most deshielded H would be next to the carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a ketone.

If the CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group, the coupling would depend on the number of neighboring H's.

Wait, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each of those H's is next to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with the adjacent CH2's H's.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, which is next to another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, with each ketone flanked by CH2 groups. So, the H's adjacent to the ketone would be coupled to the H's in the adjacent CH2.

For example, if the structure is (CH2)2(C=O)-R, the H's on the (CH2) next to the ketone would be split by the neighboring (CH2) group.

Wait, more accurately, if each carbonyl is at the end, then the H's adjacent would each have two neighboring H's (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Wait, the chemical shift would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm for CH2 next to a ketone. So in product 3, the NMR would show a triplet for those H's.

But the options include triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), and pentet (D).

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two sets of neighboring H's. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, each H would be coupled with two neighboring H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is a CH2 with two H's, then each H in the CH2 would couple with two H's, resulting in a triplet. But if the coupling is with two different sets of H's, perhaps a doublet of doublets or another pattern.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to two different groups, each with two H's, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a vinyl position, but that seems unlikely after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H is also next to another CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2. For example, a structure like CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R. The H's on the first CH2 would each be adjacent to two H's on the second CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps from the CH2 further away, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H's are part of a CH2 group next to another CH2 group which is next to a CH group, which further is next to another CH2, the coupling could become more complex.

Wait, but the most deshielded H in product 3 would be near the carbonyl. Let's consider a simple case: after ozonolysis, a molecule with two CH2 groups adjacent to a ketone. For example, a structure like (CH2)2-C(=O)-R. The H's on the first CH2 would be next to the H's on the second CH2, which is next to the carbonyl. Each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the first CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to a CH2, the splitting could be more complex. For example, a structure like CH2-CH-C(=O)-R. The H's on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH (which has two H's?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a CH group, the H's on the first CH2 would couple with both the adjacent CH2 and the CH group. Let's say, for example, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is further split by another group, say a CH group, then the pattern could be more complex.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit challenging. However, considering the options, a triplet is a common splitting when a CH2 is adjacent to another CH2.

Alternatively, if the H's are part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group which is in turn adjacent to another CH2 group (like a chain of three CH2's), then each H would couple with two H's from each adjacent group, leading to a quartet or higher splitting.

Wait, but if the H's are on a CH2 that's next to another CH2, which is next to a CH that's next to another CH2, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a geminal diol, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H's are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group which is adjacent to another CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. For example, each H on the first CH2 is split by two H's on the adjacent CH2 (giving a triplet), and each of those is split by another two H's on the next CH2 (giving another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group next to a CH2, the splitting could be a doublet of doublets or something else.

But given the options, the most likely is a triplet. Or perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Another angle: the initial structure after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. If product 2 had a trans double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have two carbonyls, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

So, the H's adjacent to the carbonyls would be in CH2 groups. Each of these H's would be split by the two H's on their neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be a triplet. But if they're also adjacent to another group, the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, but in product 3, each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. So the most deshielded H (next to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, but another possibility is that the H's are in a more complex environment, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's adjacent to the carbonyl are each coupled with two H's from their own CH2 group and another two from an adjacent group, but that's not possible because each H in the CH2 is only coupled with neighboring groups.

Wait, in a CH2 group, each H is coupled with the other H in the same CH2. But when considering adjacent groups, each H is also coupled with H's in neighboring groups. For example, if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two H's in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the splitting would be a triplet.

Thus, in product 3, the most deshielded H's (adjacent to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So the correct answer is A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, followed by analysis of the products using spectroscopic data. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with excess KOH at 240Â°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, likely formed via elimination of two equivalents of HBr, resulting in a single ketone.  

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)â**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a reaction that forms a diene (product 2). This is inferred because ozonolysis, the next step, targets double bonds.  

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2 (a diene) undergoes ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by reaction with dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  

4. **Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen is part of a CHâ group next to the carbonyl. The CHâ group is adjacent to another CHâ group, leading to coupling with two hydrogens from the neighboring CHâ.  
   - This results in a splitting pattern of a **triplet** for the most deshielded hydrogen.  

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.  

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves several reactions and spectroscopy data, so I'll need to break it down each part.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure with multiple cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane framework.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking of elimination reactions. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe a dehydrohalogenation happens. But I should think about what kind of structure that would produce. Adamantane is pretty rigid, so the positions of the Br atoms matter. If it's 1,3-dibromo, heating with KOH might lead to a double elimination, forming a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is all single bonds, right? So the elimination would form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but wait, 1,3 are not adjacent, so elimination would be possible? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a new structure. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might lose two HBr molecules when treated with a base. If it's adjacent bromines, but wait, 1 and 3 positions... perhaps they're on adjacent carbons, but not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between 1 and 2 carbons, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. So maybe each bromide undergoes elimination separately, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a ring-opening or some other structural change.

Looking at the product's NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. The IR peak at around 1720 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But wait, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent, but maybe some elimination followed by oxidation? Or perhaps the base deprotonates something, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: when dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they form epoxides, but only if it's a cyclic dihalide, like 1,2-dibromoethane would form ethylene oxide. But in adamantane, maybe the structure allows for such a ring formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that seems unlikely here.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Hmm. Let me think about the possible products. Another possibility is that each bromide leaves as Br-, and the base induces a coupling or ring-opening. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines.

Wait, KOH in such reactions could deprotonate, leading to elimination of HBr. Since the starting material has two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur. Let's say each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br. Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions in adamantane. So maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon? Because adamantane has multiple bridgehead carbons.

Wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone. So after reaction, maybe a ketone is formed. How could that happen? Maybe the base causes an elimination to form a carbene, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates and then a neighboring group participates. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes an E2 elimination occurs, leading to an alkene. But if the base is in excess, perhaps further reaction happens. Alternatively, if it's a dihalide that's not vicinal, but perhaps after two eliminations, maybe a conjugated diene is formed. But how does that give a carbonyl?

Wait, another possibility: if the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then loses Br- to form a carbonyl group. Wait, that would require adjacent Br and H. Let me think: maybe each bromide is in a position where elimination can form a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and upon elimination, a carbonyl group forms. For example, if a bridgehead carbon has Br and adjacent to it is another bridgehead, then elimination could form a ketone.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so each bridgehead is a carbon attached to three other carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on positions that are each attached to three other carbons.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, but how? Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from an adjacent bridgehead, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each bridgehead would lose HBr and form a ketone.

Wait, but if both Br atoms are eliminated, perhaps two ketones are formed. But that seems unlikely because the product's NMR doesn't show multiple carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe one of the Br's is eliminated to form a carbonyl, and the other is just eliminated as HBr, but that would require only one carbonyl.

Hmm, another possibility: the product is a diketone. But the IR would show a strong peak for two carbonyls, but the data shows only one peak at 1720. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone and some other structure.

Wait, looking at the NMR data. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where an alcohol or maybe an ether or a carbonyl group adjacent to something else might appear. Wait, 4.79 is downfield, perhaps an -OH group? But that's usually broader, unless it's an alcohol that's been deuterated, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons. So maybe it's not an -OH. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide proton? No, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe a geminal diol, but that would be a broad peak.

Wait, another thought: if the product has a ketone and some sort of diol or ether structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Let's think about the structure. If each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, then we'd have a 1,3-diketone. But the IR would show two peaks around 1720, but the data shows only one. So perhaps only one ketone is formed. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows 10H in the region of 2.41-2.23. That's around where methylene groups adjacent to carbonyls might appear. For example, in cyclohexanone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are around 2.2-2.4 ppm. So maybe there are 10H in that region, which would correspond to 5 methylene groups (each CH2). Wait, no. 10 H would be 5 CH2 groups or 10 H from something else.

Wait, let's think about adamantane. Adamantane has 12 carbons, all in a rigid structure. If two of them are replaced by carbonyl groups, the structure would change. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single carbonyl group with some branching.

Wait, another possible reaction: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, it might undergo a double elimination, losing two equivalents of HBr and forming a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit the data. So maybe not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but IR for epoxides usually have peaks around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretch. The given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbocation, and a neighboring Br leaves, forming a double bond and then a ring expansion or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an ether or an alcohol. The 1.94 ppm (2H) is more upfield, perhaps a CH2 that's less deshielded, maybe in a more rigid structure.

Wait, the product is after reaction with KOH, which is a strong base. Maybe it's an alcohol. Wait, but how? If two Br's are replaced by OH groups. Then, 1,3-diol adamantane. But how would the NMR look? The OH protons would be broad, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons. So maybe the OH groups are not part of the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's say, one of the Br's is replaced by a ketone group. Then, the adjacent CH2 groups would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm. So maybe in the NMR, the 10H in that region are from five CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but if it's a single ketone, how many CH2 groups would be adjacent? Let's think: each ketone is on a bridgehead of adamantane. The bridgehead carbons are connected to three other carbons. So if one bridgehead is a carbonyl, the adjacent carbons would each have CH2 groups connected to it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the IR absorbance. 1720 cm-1 is typical for a ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone, with the Br replaced by a carbonyl. So 1,3-diketone? No, because the IR would likely show two peaks if it's a diketone. Alternatively, perhaps only one Br is converted into a ketone, and the other is just eliminated, but that would leave another Br, which isn't in the product. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a single ketone and a diol? No, because the IR peak is only at 1720. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol. But the IR doesn't fit for an alcohol. Wait, unless it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but the peak would be around 3300 for OH. The IR data given is at 1720, so not an alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. But why would KOH form an ester? That reaction usually needs acid catalysis. Hmm, perhaps not.

Another thought: perhaps the product has a carbonyl group and some sort of geminal diol. Wait, but KOH is a base, maybe it deprotonates something. Or maybe it leads to a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that would require an epoxide to be present first, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, another angle: the NMR spectrum. Let's list the peaks:

- 4.79 (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)

So, the 2H at 4.79 could be a CH2 next to an electronegative group. The 10H in the 2.2-2.4 region are likely from CH2 groups adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 in a less deshielded environment, perhaps in a more rigid structure.

Wait, if the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane, then each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups. But the NMR shows 10H in that region. How many CH2 groups would be adjacent? Each ketone would have three adjacent carbons. For each ketone, maybe two CH2 groups adjacent. So for two ketones, that's four CH2 groups, which would account for 8 H. Plus, the remaining two H could be from another part of the structure.

Wait, but 1.94 (2H) could be for a CH2 group that's part of a bridge. So maybe the structure has two ketone groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups, and another CH2 bridge elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone, and the other Br is still present. But then, the IR would show Br absorption, which is usually around 600 cm-1. But the data doesn't mention that, so perhaps both Br's are gone.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a diepoxide. No, because IR for epoxides is around 1250 cm-1, and the data has 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl IR. So I'm back to thinking that it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single ketone. Let's say, only one Br is converted to a ketone, and the other Br is eliminated as HBr. But then, why would both Br's not react? Maybe the 1,3 positions are such that only one elimination is possible due to steric reasons.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone and an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps looking for a reaction where two bromides are removed and replaced by a carbonyl group. Maybe it's a double elimination with each Br being replaced by an oxygen, but how?

Another angle: the product is a ketone. So the structure after KOH treatment is a ketone. Then, product 1 is a ketone.

Moving to the next step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol or an alcohol, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination or alkoxylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide) might lead to some kind of enol ether formation or another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but for that, we usually need an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo an Aldol condensation, but that typically requires heat and a base, which might not fit here as Al(i-Pr)3 is a Lewis acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If product 1 is 1,3-diol adamantane, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to a reaction forming an epoxide. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(i-Pr)3 is acting as a dehydrating agent, leading to an ether formation. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think. If product 1 is a diol, then when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, it might form an epoxide. But that's typically done with an acid catalyst and a diol, like making an epoxide from a diol via acid catalysis. So perhaps product 2 is an epoxide.

Wait, but the first product's NMR didn't show any protons around 3-4 ppm, which is typical for epoxide protons. So maybe product 2 is an epoxide, but the NMR data for product 3 is what's being asked, so perhaps I need to proceed.

Assuming product 2 is an epoxide, then the next step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an epoxide would typically break the epoxide ring. Wait, no, ozone is used for cleaving double bonds. Oh wait, no, ozonolysis is for double bonds, not epoxides. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it. But product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(i-Pr)3.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Then, product 2 would be something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (light yellow solid). NMR and IR suggest a ketone.

Step 2: product 1 heated with excess Al(i-Pr)3 â product 2.

Step 3: product 2 treated with ozone at -78Â°C, then dimethylsulfide added â product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding exchangeables).

So, let's try to figure out each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane â product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, as the IR suggests. So, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but how? Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane â when treated with KOH, each Br may leave as Br-, but that would require two eliminations. Alternatively, perhaps one of the Br is eliminated as HBr, and the other forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, each bromide is on a bridgehead, so when the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, the bromide leaves as Br-, forming a carbonyl.

So, each bridgehead Br would form a carbonyl, leading to a 1,3-diketone. But the IR shows a single peak at 1720, which would suggest one ketone. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the Br's is converted into a ketone, and the other remains as a Br. But then, the IR would show a Br peak, which isn't mentioned. So perhaps both Br's are eliminated, but how to form a ketone?

Wait, another possibility: the base causes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated dienone. But that might result in two carbonyl groups, leading to two IR peaks. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone and some other structure. Wait, maybe the product is a cycloketone or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a tricyclic structure with a ketone. I'm getting stuck on this part, but perhaps I can proceed and see if the later steps make sense.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, let's say 1-ketoadamantane.

Step 2: product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3. Al(i-Pr)3 is a Lewis acid, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts, but since adamantane lacks an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for acetylation or other alkylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If it's 1-ketoadamantane, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enol formation. Maybe the Lewis acid coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen, making the enol more reactive. But I'm not sure what reaction would occur next.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(i-Pr)3 is a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is an alcohol (like 1,3-diol adamantane), then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to elimination of water, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

So, let's retrace.

Product 1: 1,3-diol adamantane (if the KOH caused both Br's to be replaced by OH groups). But wait, the IR for product 1 shows 1720, which is a carbonyl, not an alcohol. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but how would that happen with two Br's. Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR would show around 1250 cm-1, not 1720.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's think of the first reaction as forming a ketone and a diol. But that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually higher, around 2800 cm-1 for the C-H stretch. Wait, no, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a single ketone, and the other Br is still present. But that's unlikely because KOH would probably eliminate both Br's.

Alternatively, perhaps one Br is eliminated as HBr, and the other is converted into a carbonyl group. So, the product would have a ketone and a Br. But then, the IR would show a Br stretch around 600 cm-1, which isn't mentioned, so perhaps that's not the case.

This is taking a while, but perhaps I should proceed with what I have.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is formed by treatment with Al(i-Pr)3. Maybe the ketone is converted into an enol ether or undergoes some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but then product 1's IR would be around 3300 for OH, but it's at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups. Then, in product 3, the NMR would show protons adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, but let's try to figure out product 2.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then ozonolysis wouldn't affect that, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a diol. Then ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into carbonyls. But the first step involved KOH, which might form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the first step is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, product 1. Then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 could lead to some kind of addition or rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled, so perhaps I should look for the answer based on the ozonolysis step.

In the third step, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. This is a standard ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (with dimethylsulfide, which is a mild reductant), leading to the formation of carbonyl groups from the ozonide.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

Now, the question is about the most deshielded proton in product 3. The most deshielded proton is likely adjacent to the carbonyl group, as proximity to electronegative atoms deshields the proton.

In the NMR, the coupling pattern arises from neighboring protons. So, the most deshielded H would be next to the carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a ketone.

If the CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group, the coupling would depend on the number of neighboring H's.

Wait, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each of those H's is next to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with the adjacent CH2's H's.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, which is next to another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, with each ketone flanked by CH2 groups. So, the H's adjacent to the ketone would be coupled to the H's in the adjacent CH2.

For example, if the structure is (CH2)2(C=O)-R, the H's on the (CH2) next to the ketone would be split by the neighboring (CH2) group.

Wait, more accurately, if each carbonyl is at the end, then the H's adjacent would each have two neighboring H's (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Wait, the chemical shift would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm for CH2 next to a ketone. So in product 3, the NMR would show a triplet for those H's.

But the options include triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), and pentet (D).

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two sets of neighboring H's. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, each H would be coupled with two neighboring H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is a CH2 with two H's, then each H in the CH2 would couple with two H's, resulting in a triplet. But if the coupling is with two different sets of H's, perhaps a doublet of doublets or another pattern.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to two different groups, each with two H's, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a vinyl position, but that seems unlikely after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H is also next to another CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2. For example, a structure like CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R. The H's on the first CH2 would each be adjacent to two H's on the second CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps from the CH2 further away, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H's are part of a CH2 group next to another CH2 group which is next to a CH group, which further is next to another CH2, the coupling could become more complex.

Wait, but the most deshielded H in product 3 would be near the carbonyl. Let's consider a simple case: after ozonolysis, a molecule with two CH2 groups adjacent to a ketone. For example, a structure like (CH2)2-C(=O)-R. The H's on the first CH2 would be next to the H's on the second CH2, which is next to the carbonyl. Each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the first CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to a CH2, the splitting could be more complex. For example, a structure like CH2-CH-C(=O)-R. The H's on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH (which has two H's?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a CH group, the H's on the first CH2 would couple with both the adjacent CH2 and the CH group. Let's say, for example, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is further split by another group, say a CH group, then the pattern could be more complex.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit challenging. However, considering the options, a triplet is a common splitting when a CH2 is adjacent to another CH2.

Alternatively, if the H's are part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group which is in turn adjacent to another CH2 group (like a chain of three CH2's), then each H would couple with two H's from each adjacent group, leading to a quartet or higher splitting.

Wait, but if the H's are on a CH2 that's next to another CH2, which is next to a CH that's next to another CH2, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a geminal diol, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H's are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group which is adjacent to another CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. For example, each H on the first CH2 is split by two H's on the adjacent CH2 (giving a triplet), and each of those is split by another two H's on the next CH2 (giving another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group next to a CH2, the splitting could be a doublet of doublets or something else.

But given the options, the most likely is a triplet. Or perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Another angle: the initial structure after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. If product 2 had a trans double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have two carbonyls, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

So, the H's adjacent to the carbonyls would be in CH2 groups. Each of these H's would be split by the two H's on their neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be a triplet. But if they're also adjacent to another group, the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, but in product 3, each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. So the most deshielded H (next to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, but another possibility is that the H's are in a more complex environment, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's adjacent to the carbonyl are each coupled with two H's from their own CH2 group and another two from an adjacent group, but that's not possible because each H in the CH2 is only coupled with neighboring groups.

Wait, in a CH2 group, each H is coupled with the other H in the same CH2. But when considering adjacent groups, each H is also coupled with H's in neighboring groups. For example, if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two H's in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the splitting would be a triplet.

Thus, in product 3, the most deshielded H's (adjacent to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So the correct answer is A) triplet.


The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, followed by analysis of the products using spectroscopic data. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with excess KOH at 240Â°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, likely formed via elimination of two equivalents of HBr, resulting in a single ketone.  

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)â**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a reaction that forms a diene (product 2). This is inferred because ozonolysis, the next step, targets double bonds.  

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2 (a diene) undergoes ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by reaction with dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  

4. **Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen is part of a CHâ group next to the carbonyl. The CHâ group is adjacent to another CHâ group, leading to coupling with two hydrogens from the neighboring CHâ.  
   - This results in a splitting pattern of a **triplet** for the most deshielded hydrogen.  

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.  

**Answer: A**
