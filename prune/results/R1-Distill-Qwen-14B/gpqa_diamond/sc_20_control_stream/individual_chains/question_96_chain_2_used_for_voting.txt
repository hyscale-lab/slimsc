Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, and it's related to their area. Oh right, the Hawking formula, something like entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

Wait, but the problem gives me the angular size of the event horizon. Oh, right, angular size θ, and the distance d. So I need to find the actual size of the event horizon first, right? Because entropy depends on the area, which is a function of the radius.

So the formula for angular size is θ (in radians) equals the size divided by the distance. Oh wait, but θ is given in degrees. So first, I should convert that angle into radians to use the formula properly.

The conversion from degrees to radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So the given θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me calculate that. Multiplying 1e-17 by π/(180) gives approximately 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, no, wait: 1e-17 degrees is a very tiny angle. Let me compute that step by step. 1 degree is π/180 radians, so 1e-17 degrees is (π/180) * 1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah, that's right.

So θ = 1.745e-19 radians. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert parsecs into meters because the standard units for area would be in meters squared. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, the formula θ = size / distance. So the size of the event horizon, which is 2R, where R is the Schwarzschild radius, would be θ * d. So size = θ * d. So let's compute that:

size = (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. Let me calculate that. 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.37 (since 1.7 *3 is 5.1, 0.045*3 is 0.135, and 1.745*0.086 is about 0.15, so total around 5.3). So 5.3e( -19 + 26 ) = 5.3e7 meters. So the size is about 5.3e7 meters. But wait, the event horizon radius R is half that, so R ≈ 2.65e7 meters. Wait, no—wait, the size is 2R, right? Because the Schwarzschild radius is R = 2GM/c², and the event horizon is a sphere with radius R. So when you measure the angular size, the diameter is 2R, so the size calculation gives me 2R. So R is half of that, so 5.3e7 / 2 = 2.65e7 meters.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the formula. The formula for angular diameter is θ ≈ diameter / distance. So diameter is 2R, so yes, θ = 2R / d. So R = (θ * d) / 2. So that's correct. So R is approximately 5.3e7 / 2 = 2.65e7 meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely, but for order of magnitude, approximations are fine.

Now, knowing R, I can find the area of the event horizon. The area A is 4πR². So plugging in R = 2.65e7 m:

A ≈ 4 * π * (2.65e7)^2.

Compute (2.65e7)^2: 2.65^2 is about 7.0225, so 7.0225e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * π ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 7.0225e14 ≈ 8.83e15 m².

Wait, but wait: 2.65e7 squared is (2.65)^2 = 7.0225, then times 1e14 (since (1e7)^2 is 1e14) → 7.0225e14. Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. 7.0225e14 * 12.566 ≈ 88.33e14 = 8.833e15 m².

Wait, but wait another thing: I think I made a mistake in units. Because 2.65e7 meters is 2.65e7, and squared it's (2.65e7)^2 = 7.0225e14 m². Multiply by 4π gives about 8.83e15 m².

Now, the entropy S of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but wait, let me get the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that S is proportional to A/(4), because the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, let me write the exact formula. I think S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (k_B is Boltzmann constant). Wait, no, wait. Let me check: The formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area in meters squared. So yes, that's right. So S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the constants. Let me think about the correct formula. Hawking's entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/4) ? Or is it S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Hmm, perhaps I should just look it up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I think.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Or wait, maybe it's (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Wait, I think the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let me proceed with that.

So, the constants:

k_B = Boltzmann constant ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.

ħ = reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G = gravitational constant ≈ 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together:

S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Plug in the numbers:

A ≈ 8.83e15 m².

So,

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3e8 m/s)^3 * (8.83e15 m²) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J·s * 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²)).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator: k_B * c^3 * A.

k_B = 1.38e-23.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

A = 8.83e15 m².

So multiplying them together:

1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = (1.38 * 2.7) * 1e2 = 3.726 * 1e2 = 372.6. Then multiply by 8.83e15:

372.6 * 8.83e15 ≈ 372.6 * 8.83 ≈ let's compute 372 *8.83.

Wait, 372 *8 is 2976, 372 *0.83 is about 308. So total approx 3284. So 3284e15 = 3.284e18.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately: 372.6 * 8.83e15 = 372.6 *8.83 = let's compute 372.6 *8 = 2980.8, 372.6 *0.83 ≈ 308.238. So total is 2980.8 + 308.238 ≈ 3289.038. So 3289.038e15 = 3.289e18. So numerator is approximately 3.289e18 J·m²/(s·kg) ? Wait, because the units would be:

k_B is J/K, c^3 is m³/s³, A is m² → (J/K) * (m³/s³) * m² = J m^5/(K s^3).

But maybe handling units is more complicated, perhaps I should focus on the numbers.

Denominator is 4 * ħ * G.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J·s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

So 4 * ħ * G = 4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute this:

4 *1.05457e-34 = 4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ (4.21828 *6.6743) * 1e-45 ≈ 28.16 *1e-45 ≈ 2.816e-44.

So denominator is 2.816e-44 J·s * m³/(kg·s²) ) → let me see, units would be J·m³/(kg·s^3) ?

Hmm, perhaps the units will cancel out correctly in the end.

So S = numerator / denominator = (3.289e18) / (2.816e-44) → 3.289e18 / 2.816e-44 = (3.289 / 2.816) * 1e(18+44) ) → approx 1.168 * 1e62 → 1.168e62 J/K.

Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, option C is 1e66, etc.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 1e62 is option A, but I think supermassive black holes have entropy on the order of 1e65 or more. Wait, maybe I messed up in calculating the area.

Wait, let me recheck the area calculation. So I found R≈2.65e7 m. Then A=4π R². So R^2 is (2.65e7)^2 = 7.0225e14 m². 4π is about 12.566. So A=7.0225e14 *12.566 ≈ 8.83e15 m². So that's correct.

Wait, but when I computed the numerator, I had k_B * c^3 * A. Let me recompute that:

k_B =1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 (since 3^3=27, (1e8)^3=1e24) → 2.7e25 m³/s³.

A=8.83e15 m².

So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7 = 3.726 → 3.726e2 → 372.6. Multiply by 8.83e15 → 372.6 *8.83e15 = 3.289e18.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ (1.05 *6.67) ≈ 7.0e-45 (exponents: -34-11= -45). Then 4 *7.0e-45 is 2.8e-44.

So S=3.289e18 / 2.8e-44 = approx 1.17e62 J/K.

Wait, but that's like 1e62, which is option A. But wait, I thought that a supermassive black hole has entropy around 1e65 or higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * (k_B is Boltzmann's constant). Wait, no, I think the correct formula is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Wait, let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) )^{-1} ? No, I'm getting confused. Another approach: the formula for the area of the event horizon is A = 16 π (GM/c²)^2. And the entropy is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Hmm, perhaps I should use that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of the black hole first, then compute the entropy.

Wait, because R = 2 G M / c². So M = (R c²)/(2 G). Let me compute M.

R is 2.65e7 m.

So M = (2.65e7 m * (9e16 m²/s²)) / (2 *6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²))).

Compute numerator: 2.65e7 *9e16 = 23.85e23 = 2.385e24 m³/s².

Denominator: 2*6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10.

So M = (2.385e24) / (1.33486e-10) ) kg → 2.385e24 /1.33486e-10 ≈ 1.786e34 kg.

Wait, that's a huge mass, which makes sense for a supermassive black hole.

Now, compute entropy using S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

We have A as 8.83e15 m².

So plugging in the numbers:

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3e8 m/s)^3 * (8.83e15 m²) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J·s *6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²))).

Wait, perhaps I should compute this step by step.

Compute numerator: 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *8.83e15.

(3e8)^3 =27e24= 2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7=3.726 → 3.726e2=372.6.

372.6 *8.83e15= 3.289e18.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = 7.04e-45.

4 *7.04e-45 = 2.816e-44.

So S = 3.289e18 / 2.816e-44 = approx 1.168e62 J/K.

Hmm, that's about 1e62, which is option A.

But I thought supermassive black holes have much higher entropy, like 1e65 or so. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of R. Let me re-examine the initial steps.

The problem states that the angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees.

Wait, so θ =1e-17 degrees. To find the actual size (diameter, which is 2R), we use θ (in radians) = size / distance.

Size = θ_rad * distance.

θ_rad =1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 5.23599e-19 radians.

Wait, wait, because 1 degree is π/180 radians.

So 1e-17 degrees = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1e-17 * 1.74533e-2 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

So size = θ_rad * d =1.74533e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m = approximately 5.37e7 meters.

Wait, that's 5.37e7 meters, which is 5.37e4 kilometers, which is about 5.37e4 km. That seems plausible for a supermassive black hole's event horizon.

So R is 5.37e7 / 2 = 2.685e7 meters.

Then area A=4π R² =4 * π * (2.685e7)^2.

Compute R squared: (2.685e7)^2 = 7.214e14 m².

Multiply by 4π: 7.214e14 *12.566 ≈ 9.06e15 m².

Wait, earlier I had 8.83e15, but this is 9.06e15. Close enough for approximation.

Hmm, so when I compute the numerator:

k_B * c^3 * A =1.38e-23 * (27e24) *9.06e15.

Wait, 1.38e-23 *27e24 = 1.38 *27 = 37.26 → 37.26e1 → 372.6.

Multiply by 9.06e15: 372.6 *9.06e15 ≈ 3374e15 =3.374e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Again same as before: 4 * (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11) → 4 *7.04e-45 → 2.816e-44.

So S=3.374e18 /2.816e-44 ≈ 1.198e62 J/K.

Hmm, so that's approximately 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but why do I think supermassive black holes have higher entropy? Let me think about typical masses and their entropy.

The mass of a supermassive black hole is about 1e6 to 1e9 solar masses. One solar mass is about 2e30 kg. So 1e9 solar masses is 2e39 kg.

If M=2e39 kg, then R = 2.95e9 m (since R is 2.95e9 meters per solar mass). So R≈2.95e9 *2e39? No, wait, no. Wait, R=2GM/c².

Wait, let me compute for M=1e9 solar masses.

M =1e9 * 2e30 kg =2e39 kg.

So R= (2*G*M)/(c²) → (2 *6.67e-11 * 2e39) / (9e16).

Compute numerator:2 *6.67e-11 =1.334e-10.

1.334e-10 *2e39 =2.668e29.

Divide by 9e16: 2.668e29 /9e16 = 2.965e12 meters.

Hmm, that's R=2.965e12 m. So the diameter is 5.93e12 m.

Now, let's compute the angular size θ in radians: θ= (5.93e12 m) / (3.086e26 m) ) ≈ 1.92e-14 radians.

Convert to degrees: 1.92e-14 rad * (180/π) ≈ 5.73e-13 degrees.

Wait, that's a much larger angle than the given 1e-17 degrees. So the given θ is much smaller, implying a much smaller R and hence a much less massive black hole. Or perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, no, the problem gives a θ of 1e-17 degrees, which is way smaller than 5e-13 degrees. So the black hole in the problem is much more distant or has a much smaller size. Wait, but the distance is fixed at 1e10 parsecs. So given that, the size is very small, leading to a lower entropy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the entropy using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

But wait, let me think about the actual formula. The correct formula for the entropy is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/4) ?

Wait, I think I might have made an error in the formula. Let me check again: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (k_B is Boltzmann's constant).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Let me find the exact formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula is S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the units to figure it out.

Entropy S has units of J/K.

A is in m².

ħ has units J·s.

G has units m³/(kg·s²).

c has units m/s.

k_B is J/K.

So the formula should have units:

(A [m²] * c^3 [m³/s^3]) / ( ħ [J s] * G [m³/(kg s²)] ) ) multiplied by k_B [ J/K ].

Wait, let me compute the units:

(A c^3) → m² * m³/s³ → m^5/s^3.

Divide by (ħ G) → (J s) * (m³/(kg s²)) → J m³/(kg s).

So the units become (m^5/s^3) / (J m³/(kg s)) ) → m^5/s^3 * kg s/(J m³) → kg m^2 s^(-3 +1) ) / J.

J is kg m²/s². So replacing J:

kg m^2 s^{-2}.

So the units so far: kg m^2 s^{-2}.

Hmm, it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the formula correctly.

Another approach: I think I made a mistake in the initial formula, using S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) instead of S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, let me check a source. Oh wait, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon.

So that means S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

So in that case, the calculation would be:

A=8.83e15 m².

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.055e-34 J·s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

So S = (8.83e15 * 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 ) / (4 * 1.055e-34 *6.6743e-11 ).

Compute numerator: 8.83e15 *1.38e-23 = (8.83 *1.38) =12.18e-8 → 1.218e-7.

Multiply by (3e8)^3=27e24: 1.218e-7 *27e24 = (1.218 *27 )e17 → approx 32.9e17 → 3.29e18.

Denominator:4 *1.055e-34 *6.6743e-11 =4 * (1.055e-34 *6.6743e-11) → 4 *7.04e-45 → 2.816e-44.

So S=3.29e18 / 2.816e-44 = approx 1.17e62 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before.

So the correct answer would be 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but the options have option D as 1e65. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because I thought the correct formula includes the Planck constant in denominator as ħ, but perhaps I should have used G instead. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the area A is in Planck units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the Schwarzschild radius. The area A is 16 π (GM/c²)^2. So perhaps I can express S in terms of M.

S = (k_B c^3 *16 π (GM/c²)^2 )/(4 ħ G )

Simplify:

= (16 π k_B c^3 G^2 M^2 / c^4 ) / (4 ħ G )

= (16 π k_B G^2 M^2 )/(4 ħ G c )

= (4 π k_B G M^2 )/( ħ c )

Hmm, but perhaps that won't help me much here. Alternatively, I can compute M from the given R.

Because R = 2 G M / c^2 → M = R c²/(2 G).

We found R to be approximately 2.65e7 meters.

So M = (2.65e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 *6.67e-11 m^3/kg/s²)

Compute numerator:2.65e7 *9e16 = 2.385e24 m^3/s².

Denominator:2 *6.67e-11 =1.334e-10.

So M = 2.385e24 /1.334e-10 =approx 1.786e34 kg.

Now, entropy S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

We can also compute it via M.

S = (k_B c^3/(4 ħ G)) * A.

A = 4 π R² =4 π (2.65e7)^2 =approx 8.83e15 m².

So again, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the area in Planck units.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mistake is in the calculation of R. Let me recheck.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. Convert to radians: 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 5.23599e-19 radians.

Distance d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

Size = θ *d =5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 = approximately 1.61e8 m.

Wait, wait a minute! Wait, 5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 = let's compute exponents: 3.086e26 is 3.086 *1e26, and 5.23599e-19 is 5.23599e-19.

Multiply 5.23599e-19 *3.086e26.

5.23599 *3.086 ≈ 16.13.

Exponents: e(-19+26) =e7.

So size=16.13e7 m =1.613e8 m.

Wait, that's 1.613e8 meters. So that's the diameter. So R is half of that: 8.065e7 meters.

Wait, this is different from what I had earlier. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, initial step:

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad =θ_deg * (π/180) =1e-17 * π/180 ≈5.23599e-19 radians.

d=1e10 parsec =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

Size (diameter) =θ_rad *d =5.23599e-19 *3.086e26.

Compute this:

5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 =5.23599 *3.086 *1e7.

5.23599 *3.086 ≈ 16.13.

So size =16.13e7 m =1.613e8 m.

Thus, R =8.065e7 m.

Then area A=4π R² =4 * π * (8.065e7)^2.

(8.065e7)^2 =65.04e14 =6.504e15 m².

Multiply by 4π: 4 *3.1416 *6.504e15 ≈12.566 *6.504e15 ≈82.06e15 =8.206e16 m².

Wait, that's a much larger area than before. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Initially, I thought that θ_rad was 1.745e-19, but that's when I multiplied 1e-17 * π/(180) which is 1e-17 * 0.0174532925 ≈1.7453e-19. So that's correct.

But then when I computed size = θ_rad * d, I think I miscalculated. Because earlier, I thought size was 5.37e7 m, but this time it's 1.61e8 m.

Wait, let me compute 5.23599e-19 *3.086e26.

5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 = (5.23599 *3.086) *1e7 → 16.13 *1e7 →1.613e8 m. So diameter is 1.613e8 m, so R is 8.065e7 m.

So area is 4π R² →4 * π * (8.065e7)^2.

Compute R squared: (8.065e7)^2 =65.04e14 =6.504e15 m².

Multiply by 4π: 4 *3.1416 *6.504e15 ≈12.566 *6.504e15 ≈82.06e15 m² =8.206e16 m².

Ah, that's a much larger area than before. So I must have made a mistake earlier in the size calculation, which led to a much smaller area and thus lower entropy.

Wait, so why did I get a much smaller size earlier? Oh, I think I confused parsecs and something else. Let me recheck.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the size the first time. Wait, in the first calculation, I thought that the size was 5.37e7 meters, but that's incorrect. The correct calculation gives size =1.6e8 meters. So the earlier calculation was wrong because I forgot that 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters, so 5.235e-19 *3.086e26 is indeed about 1.6e8 meters.

So with the correct R, we can recompute the entropy.

So A=8.206e16 m².

Now, compute S= (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

c=3e8 m/s.

A=8.206e16 m².

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

So numerator:1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *8.206e16.

Compute (3e8)^3=27e24=2.7e25.

1.38e-23 *2.7e25= (1.38 *2.7) *1e2=3.726e2=372.6.

372.6 *8.206e16= 372.6 *8.206 ≈ 3055. So 3055e16=3.055e19.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11=7.04e-45.

Multiply by 4: 4 *7.04e-45=2.816e-44.

So S=3.055e19 /2.816e-44 = (3.055/2.816) *1e(19+44) → approx 1.085 *1e63 →1.085e63 J/K.

Which is approximately 1e63, which is between options A (1e62) and D (1e65). But none of the options exactly match. Wait, but perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute the numerator and denominator accurately.

Compute numerator:

1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 =1.38e-23 *2.7e25= (1.38 *2.7) *1e2 → 3.726e2=372.6.

372.6 *8.206e16=372.6 *8.206 = ?

Compute 372.6 *8 = 2980.8, 372.6 *0.206= 76.7556. So total is 3057.5556.

So 3057.5556e16 =3.0575556e19.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457*6.6743) *1e-45 → approx 7.04e-45.

Multiply by4: 4 *7.04e-45 =2.816e-44.

So S=3.0575556e19 / 2.816e-44.

3.0575556e19 /2.816e-44 = (3.0575556 /2.816) ) *1e(19+44) → approx 1.085 *1e63 →1.085e63 J/K.

So order of magnitude is 1e63. But the options don't have that. The options are A)1e62, B)1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me recompute A.

R=8.065e7 m.

R²= (8.065e7)^2 = (8.065)^2 * (1e7)^2 →8.065^2 is about 65.04 →65.04e14 =6.504e15 m².

A=4π R²=4 *3.1416 *6.504e15=12.566 *6.504e15=82.06e15=8.206e16 m².

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but then the numerator:1.38e-23 *2.7e25=3.726e2.

3.726e2 *8.206e16= 3.726 *8.206e18 →30.57e18 →3.057e19.

Denominator is 2.816e-44.

So S=3.057e19 /2.816e-44= 1.085e63 J/K.

Hmm, but the options don't include 1e63. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D (1e65), but I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units of S. Let me check the formula again.

The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * k_B? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: The formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula with another approach. The Planck area is ħ G / c^4, and the entropy is S= A/(4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length.

Wait, l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ) → l_p² = ħ G / c^3.

So S = A/(4 (ħ G/c^3)) ) * (k_B c^3)/(ħ G) ) → Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) → no, earlier I thought the formula was S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Wait, but perhaps I should look up the formula correctly.

Upon checking, the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) × (k_B is Boltzmann's constant). Wait, no, another source says S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So I think the formula is correct as I used it before.

Wait, but perhaps I actually should have used S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me try that.

So with A=8.206e16 m².

Compute numerator: A c^3 =8.206e16 * (3e8)^3 =8.206e16 *2.7e24 =2.2156e41.

Divide by 4 ħ G k_B.

4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute denominator:

4 *1.05457e-34=4.218e-34.

4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 =2.815e-44.

2.815e-44 *1.38e-23 =3.897e-67.

So S=2.2156e41 /3.897e-67 = approx 5.68e107 J/K.

That can't be right. So perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Let me proceed with that, which gives S≈1e63 J/K.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the area, or perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but considering the options, the closest would be option D: 1e65.

Wait, but I got 1e63. Let me see where I could have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me recompute:

R=8.065e7 m.

R squared: (8.065e7)^2 →8.065^2=65.04, so 65.04e14 m².

A=4π *65.04e14 =4 *3.1416 *65.04e14 ≈12.566 *65.04e14 ≈820.6e14 =8.206e16 m².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when calculating S.

S= (1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *8.206e16 ) / (4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 )

Compute numerator:

3e8^3=2.7e24.

1.38e-23 *2.7e24 = 1.38 *2.7e1=3.726e1=37.26.

37.26 *8.206e16= 37.26 *8.206e16 = 305.7e16 =3.057e18.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 →4 *7.04e-45=2.816e-44.

S=3.057e18 /2.816e-44= 1.085e62 J/K.

Oh! Wait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier in the numerator calculation. Because when I compute 1.38e-23 *2.7e25, it is 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7) *1e2 = 3.726e2 = 372.6.

Wait, no! Because 2.7e25 is 2.7 *1e25. So 1e-23 *1e25 =1e2. So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25= (1.38 *2.7) *1e2 =3.726 *1e2 =372.6.

Then multiply by 8.206e16: 372.6 *8.206e16 =372.6 *8.206 *1e16.

372.6 *8.206 ≈3057. So 3057e16 =3.057e19.

Denominator:2.816e-44.

So S=3.057e19 /2.816e-44 =3.057e19 /2.816e-44 = (3.057/2.816) *1e(19+44) →approx 1.085 *1e63 →1.085e63 J/K.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance conversion.

Wait, the distance is 1e10 parsec. 1 parsec =3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs=3.086e16 *1e10 =3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest option is D) 1e65. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the mass instead. Let me try that.

We have M = R c²/(2 G).

R=8.065e7 m.

So M=(8.065e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2) / (2 *6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²)).

Compute numerator:8.065e7 *9e16 =7.2585e24.

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11=1.33486e-10.

So M=7.2585e24 /1.33486e-10 →approx 5.438e34 kg.

Now, using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

But perhaps using another approach: S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) = (k_B c^3 * (16 π G² M² )/(c^4) )) / (4 ħ G).

Simplify:

= (16 π k_B G^2 M^2 c^3) / (4 ħ G c^4 )

= (4 π k_B G M^2) / ( ħ c )

Plugging in the values:

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

M=5.438e34 kg.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So S= (4 * π *1.38e-23 *6.6743e-11 * (5.438e34)^2 ) / (1.05457e-34 *3e8 ).

Compute numerator:

4 * π ≈12.566.

12.566 *1.38e-23 ≈17.27e-23.

17.27e-23 *6.6743e-11 ≈1.155e-32.

(5.438e34)^2 =2.958e69.

So 1.155e-32 *2.958e69 =3.42e37.

Denominator: 1.05457e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

So S=3.42e37 /3.1637e-26 =1.081e63 J/K.

Again, same result. So the entropy is approximately 1e63 J/K. But the given options don't have 1e63.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation again. Let me recheck the numerator calculation.

Wait, (5.438e34 kg)^2 = (5.438)^2 *1e68 →approx 29.56e68 =2.956e69 kg².

So 4 pi k_B G M^2 =4 *3.1416 *1.38e-23 *6.6743e-11 *2.956e69.

Compute step by step:

4 *3.1416=12.566.

12.566 *1.38e-23=17.27e-23.

17.27e-23 *6.6743e-11=17.27 *6.6743=115.5 →115.5e-34.

115.5e-34 *2.956e69 =115.5 *2.956=341.7 →341.7e35 =3.417e37.

Denominator: ħ c =1.05457e-34 *3e8=3.1637e-26.

So S=3.417e37 /3.1637e-26 =1.08e63 J/K.

Hmm, same result. So why the options don't have 1e63. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step of calculating the angular size.

Wait, the problem says θ=1e-17 degrees. Let me recheck the calculation of the size.

θ=1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad=1e-17 * (π/180) ≈5.23599e-19 radians.

d=1e10 parsecs=3.086e26 m.

size= θ_rad *d =5.23599e-19 *3.086e26= (5.23599 *3.086) *1e7 →16.13 *1e7=1.613e8 m.

So diameter is 1.613e8 m; R=8.065e7 m. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to account for the fact that the angular size is the diameter, not the radius. No, because in the formula θ = size/d, size is the diameter.

Wait, no, because θ is the angular diameter, which is the diameter of the object divided by the distance. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the entropy using the Schwarzschild radius formula, and then compute the area.

The Schwarzschild radius R_s=2 G M/c².

We have R = R_s, so M=R c²/(2 G).

So M=8.065e7 m * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2*6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²)).

M=8.065e7 *9e16 / (1.33486e-10) →(7.2585e24) /1.33486e-10 →5.438e34 kg.

Then, the area A=4 pi R²=4 pi (8.065e7)^2=8.206e16 m².

So using S=(A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G):

A=8.206e16.

So S=(8.206e16 *1.38e-23 *2.7e25) / (4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11).

Compute numerator:8.206e16 *1.38e-23=1.13e-7.

1.13e-7 *2.7e25=3.051e18.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11=2.816e-44.

So S=3.051e18 /2.816e-44=1.085e62 J/K.

Wait, same result as before. So the correct answer is approximately 1e62, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that supermassive black holes have higher entropy. But perhaps the given black hole is not that massive. Because the problem states that the black hole is at a distance of 1e10 parsecs, which is 3.086e26 meters. And the angular size is 1e-17 degrees, which corresponds to a small R.

So the entropy is around 1e62 J/K, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A k_B c^3}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant.

### Step 1: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius \(R\)
The angular size of the event horizon is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\). To find the Schwarzschild radius \(R\), we first convert \(\theta\) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 5.23599 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The distance to the black hole is \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}\).

The size of the event horizon (diameter) is given by:

\[
\text{Diameter} = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (5.23599 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 1.613 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the Schwarzschild radius is:

\[
R = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.613 \times 10^{8}}{2} \approx 8.065 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon \(A\)
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2 = 4 \pi (8.065 \times 10^{7})^2.
\]

First, calculate \(R^2\):

\[
R^2 = (8.065 \times 10^{7})^2 \approx 6.504 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Then, calculate \(A\):

\[
A = 4 \pi (6.504 \times 10^{15}) \approx 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 6.504 \times 10^{15} \approx 8.206 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
Using the formula for entropy:

\[
S = \frac{A k_B c^3}{4 \hbar G},
\]

we substitute the constants:
- \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\),
- \(c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/(\text{kg·s}^2)\),
- \(A = 8.206 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2\).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
A k_B c^3 = (8.206 \times 10^{16}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (3 \times 10^{8})^3.
\]

\[
(3 \times 10^{8})^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{24}, \quad A k_B c^3 = (8.206 \times 10^{16}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{24}).
\]

\[
A k_B c^3 \approx 3.057 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) = 4 \cdot 7.04 \times 10^{-45} \approx 2.816 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, calculate \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{3.057 \times 10^{19}}{2.816 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 1.085 \times 10^{63} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated entropy is approximately \(10^{63} \, \text{J/K}\). However, the closest option provided is:

**A) \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\).**

Thus, the answer is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, and it's related to their area. Oh right, the Hawking formula, something like entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

Wait, but the problem gives me the angular size of the event horizon. Oh, right, angular size θ, and the distance d. So I need to find the actual size of the event horizon first, right? Because entropy depends on the area, which is a function of the radius.

So the formula for angular size is θ (in radians) equals the size divided by the distance. Oh wait, but θ is given in degrees. So first, I should convert that angle into radians to use the formula properly.

The conversion from degrees to radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So the given θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me calculate that. Multiplying 1e-17 by π/(180) gives approximately 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, no, wait: 1e-17 degrees is a very tiny angle. Let me compute that step by step. 1 degree is π/180 radians, so 1e-17 degrees is (π/180) * 1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah, that's right.

So θ = 1.745e-19 radians. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert parsecs into meters because the standard units for area would be in meters squared. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, the formula θ = size / distance. So the size of the event horizon, which is 2R, where R is the Schwarzschild radius, would be θ * d. So size = θ * d. So let's compute that:

size = (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. Let me calculate that. 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.37 (since 1.7 *3 is 5.1, 0.045*3 is 0.135, and 1.745*0.086 is about 0.15, so total around 5.3). So 5.3e( -19 + 26 ) = 5.3e7 meters. So the size is about 5.3e7 meters. But wait, the event horizon radius R is half that, so R ≈ 2.65e7 meters. Wait, no—wait, the size is 2R, right? Because the Schwarzschild radius is R = 2GM/c², and the event horizon is a sphere with radius R. So when you measure the angular size, the diameter is 2R, so the size calculation gives me 2R. So R is half of that, so 5.3e7 / 2 = 2.65e7 meters.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the formula. The formula for angular diameter is θ ≈ diameter / distance. So diameter is 2R, so yes, θ = 2R / d. So R = (θ * d) / 2. So that's correct. So R is approximately 5.3e7 / 2 = 2.65e7 meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely, but for order of magnitude, approximations are fine.

Now, knowing R, I can find the area of the event horizon. The area A is 4πR². So plugging in R = 2.65e7 m:

A ≈ 4 * π * (2.65e7)^2.

Compute (2.65e7)^2: 2.65^2 is about 7.0225, so 7.0225e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * π ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 7.0225e14 ≈ 8.83e15 m².

Wait, but wait: 2.65e7 squared is (2.65)^2 = 7.0225, then times 1e14 (since (1e7)^2 is 1e14) → 7.0225e14. Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. 7.0225e14 * 12.566 ≈ 88.33e14 = 8.833e15 m².

Wait, but wait another thing: I think I made a mistake in units. Because 2.65e7 meters is 2.65e7, and squared it's (2.65e7)^2 = 7.0225e14 m². Multiply by 4π gives about 8.83e15 m².

Now, the entropy S of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but wait, let me get the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that S is proportional to A/(4), because the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, let me write the exact formula. I think S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (k_B is Boltzmann constant). Wait, no, wait. Let me check: The formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area in meters squared. So yes, that's right. So S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the constants. Let me think about the correct formula. Hawking's entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/4) ? Or is it S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Hmm, perhaps I should just look it up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I think.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Or wait, maybe it's (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Wait, I think the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let me proceed with that.

So, the constants:

k_B = Boltzmann constant ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.

ħ = reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G = gravitational constant ≈ 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together:

S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Plug in the numbers:

A ≈ 8.83e15 m².

So,

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3e8 m/s)^3 * (8.83e15 m²) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J·s * 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²)).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator: k_B * c^3 * A.

k_B = 1.38e-23.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

A = 8.83e15 m².

So multiplying them together:

1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = (1.38 * 2.7) * 1e2 = 3.726 * 1e2 = 372.6. Then multiply by 8.83e15:

372.6 * 8.83e15 ≈ 372.6 * 8.83 ≈ let's compute 372 *8.83.

Wait, 372 *8 is 2976, 372 *0.83 is about 308. So total approx 3284. So 3284e15 = 3.284e18.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately: 372.6 * 8.83e15 = 372.6 *8.83 = let's compute 372.6 *8 = 2980.8, 372.6 *0.83 ≈ 308.238. So total is 2980.8 + 308.238 ≈ 3289.038. So 3289.038e15 = 3.289e18. So numerator is approximately 3.289e18 J·m²/(s·kg) ? Wait, because the units would be:

k_B is J/K, c^3 is m³/s³, A is m² → (J/K) * (m³/s³) * m² = J m^5/(K s^3).

But maybe handling units is more complicated, perhaps I should focus on the numbers.

Denominator is 4 * ħ * G.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J·s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

So 4 * ħ * G = 4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute this:

4 *1.05457e-34 = 4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ (4.21828 *6.6743) * 1e-45 ≈ 28.16 *1e-45 ≈ 2.816e-44.

So denominator is 2.816e-44 J·s * m³/(kg·s²) ) → let me see, units would be J·m³/(kg·s^3) ?

Hmm, perhaps the units will cancel out correctly in the end.

So S = numerator / denominator = (3.289e18) / (2.816e-44) → 3.289e18 / 2.816e-44 = (3.289 / 2.816) * 1e(18+44) ) → approx 1.168 * 1e62 → 1.168e62 J/K.

Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, option C is 1e66, etc.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 1e62 is option A, but I think supermassive black holes have entropy on the order of 1e65 or more. Wait, maybe I messed up in calculating the area.

Wait, let me recheck the area calculation. So I found R≈2.65e7 m. Then A=4π R². So R^2 is (2.65e7)^2 = 7.0225e14 m². 4π is about 12.566. So A=7.0225e14 *12.566 ≈ 8.83e15 m². So that's correct.

Wait, but when I computed the numerator, I had k_B * c^3 * A. Let me recompute that:

k_B =1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 (since 3^3=27, (1e8)^3=1e24) → 2.7e25 m³/s³.

A=8.83e15 m².

So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7 = 3.726 → 3.726e2 → 372.6. Multiply by 8.83e15 → 372.6 *8.83e15 = 3.289e18.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ (1.05 *6.67) ≈ 7.0e-45 (exponents: -34-11= -45). Then 4 *7.0e-45 is 2.8e-44.

So S=3.289e18 / 2.8e-44 = approx 1.17e62 J/K.

Wait, but that's like 1e62, which is option A. But wait, I thought that a supermassive black hole has entropy around 1e65 or higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * (k_B is Boltzmann's constant). Wait, no, I think the correct formula is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Wait, let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) )^{-1} ? No, I'm getting confused. Another approach: the formula for the area of the event horizon is A = 16 π (GM/c²)^2. And the entropy is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Hmm, perhaps I should use that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of the black hole first, then compute the entropy.

Wait, because R = 2 G M / c². So M = (R c²)/(2 G). Let me compute M.

R is 2.65e7 m.

So M = (2.65e7 m * (9e16 m²/s²)) / (2 *6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²))).

Compute numerator: 2.65e7 *9e16 = 23.85e23 = 2.385e24 m³/s².

Denominator: 2*6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10.

So M = (2.385e24) / (1.33486e-10) ) kg → 2.385e24 /1.33486e-10 ≈ 1.786e34 kg.

Wait, that's a huge mass, which makes sense for a supermassive black hole.

Now, compute entropy using S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

We have A as 8.83e15 m².

So plugging in the numbers:

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3e8 m/s)^3 * (8.83e15 m²) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J·s *6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²))).

Wait, perhaps I should compute this step by step.

Compute numerator: 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *8.83e15.

(3e8)^3 =27e24= 2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7=3.726 → 3.726e2=372.6.

372.6 *8.83e15= 3.289e18.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = 7.04e-45.

4 *7.04e-45 = 2.816e-44.

So S = 3.289e18 / 2.816e-44 = approx 1.168e62 J/K.

Hmm, that's about 1e62, which is option A.

But I thought supermassive black holes have much higher entropy, like 1e65 or so. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of R. Let me re-examine the initial steps.

The problem states that the angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees.

Wait, so θ =1e-17 degrees. To find the actual size (diameter, which is 2R), we use θ (in radians) = size / distance.

Size = θ_rad * distance.

θ_rad =1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 5.23599e-19 radians.

Wait, wait, because 1 degree is π/180 radians.

So 1e-17 degrees = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1e-17 * 1.74533e-2 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

So size = θ_rad * d =1.74533e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m = approximately 5.37e7 meters.

Wait, that's 5.37e7 meters, which is 5.37e4 kilometers, which is about 5.37e4 km. That seems plausible for a supermassive black hole's event horizon.

So R is 5.37e7 / 2 = 2.685e7 meters.

Then area A=4π R² =4 * π * (2.685e7)^2.

Compute R squared: (2.685e7)^2 = 7.214e14 m².

Multiply by 4π: 7.214e14 *12.566 ≈ 9.06e15 m².

Wait, earlier I had 8.83e15, but this is 9.06e15. Close enough for approximation.

Hmm, so when I compute the numerator:

k_B * c^3 * A =1.38e-23 * (27e24) *9.06e15.

Wait, 1.38e-23 *27e24 = 1.38 *27 = 37.26 → 37.26e1 → 372.6.

Multiply by 9.06e15: 372.6 *9.06e15 ≈ 3374e15 =3.374e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Again same as before: 4 * (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11) → 4 *7.04e-45 → 2.816e-44.

So S=3.374e18 /2.816e-44 ≈ 1.198e62 J/K.

Hmm, so that's approximately 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but why do I think supermassive black holes have higher entropy? Let me think about typical masses and their entropy.

The mass of a supermassive black hole is about 1e6 to 1e9 solar masses. One solar mass is about 2e30 kg. So 1e9 solar masses is 2e39 kg.

If M=2e39 kg, then R = 2.95e9 m (since R is 2.95e9 meters per solar mass). So R≈2.95e9 *2e39? No, wait, no. Wait, R=2GM/c².

Wait, let me compute for M=1e9 solar masses.

M =1e9 * 2e30 kg =2e39 kg.

So R= (2*G*M)/(c²) → (2 *6.67e-11 * 2e39) / (9e16).

Compute numerator:2 *6.67e-11 =1.334e-10.

1.334e-10 *2e39 =2.668e29.

Divide by 9e16: 2.668e29 /9e16 = 2.965e12 meters.

Hmm, that's R=2.965e12 m. So the diameter is 5.93e12 m.

Now, let's compute the angular size θ in radians: θ= (5.93e12 m) / (3.086e26 m) ) ≈ 1.92e-14 radians.

Convert to degrees: 1.92e-14 rad * (180/π) ≈ 5.73e-13 degrees.

Wait, that's a much larger angle than the given 1e-17 degrees. So the given θ is much smaller, implying a much smaller R and hence a much less massive black hole. Or perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, no, the problem gives a θ of 1e-17 degrees, which is way smaller than 5e-13 degrees. So the black hole in the problem is much more distant or has a much smaller size. Wait, but the distance is fixed at 1e10 parsecs. So given that, the size is very small, leading to a lower entropy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the entropy using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

But wait, let me think about the actual formula. The correct formula for the entropy is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/4) ?

Wait, I think I might have made an error in the formula. Let me check again: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (k_B is Boltzmann's constant).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Let me find the exact formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula is S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the units to figure it out.

Entropy S has units of J/K.

A is in m².

ħ has units J·s.

G has units m³/(kg·s²).

c has units m/s.

k_B is J/K.

So the formula should have units:

(A [m²] * c^3 [m³/s^3]) / ( ħ [J s] * G [m³/(kg s²)] ) ) multiplied by k_B [ J/K ].

Wait, let me compute the units:

(A c^3) → m² * m³/s³ → m^5/s^3.

Divide by (ħ G) → (J s) * (m³/(kg s²)) → J m³/(kg s).

So the units become (m^5/s^3) / (J m³/(kg s)) ) → m^5/s^3 * kg s/(J m³) → kg m^2 s^(-3 +1) ) / J.

J is kg m²/s². So replacing J:

kg m^2 s^{-2}.

So the units so far: kg m^2 s^{-2}.

Hmm, it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the formula correctly.

Another approach: I think I made a mistake in the initial formula, using S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) instead of S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, let me check a source. Oh wait, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon.

So that means S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

So in that case, the calculation would be:

A=8.83e15 m².

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.055e-34 J·s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

So S = (8.83e15 * 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 ) / (4 * 1.055e-34 *6.6743e-11 ).

Compute numerator: 8.83e15 *1.38e-23 = (8.83 *1.38) =12.18e-8 → 1.218e-7.

Multiply by (3e8)^3=27e24: 1.218e-7 *27e24 = (1.218 *27 )e17 → approx 32.9e17 → 3.29e18.

Denominator:4 *1.055e-34 *6.6743e-11 =4 * (1.055e-34 *6.6743e-11) → 4 *7.04e-45 → 2.816e-44.

So S=3.29e18 / 2.816e-44 = approx 1.17e62 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before.

So the correct answer would be 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but the options have option D as 1e65. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because I thought the correct formula includes the Planck constant in denominator as ħ, but perhaps I should have used G instead. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the area A is in Planck units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the Schwarzschild radius. The area A is 16 π (GM/c²)^2. So perhaps I can express S in terms of M.

S = (k_B c^3 *16 π (GM/c²)^2 )/(4 ħ G )

Simplify:

= (16 π k_B c^3 G^2 M^2 / c^4 ) / (4 ħ G )

= (16 π k_B G^2 M^2 )/(4 ħ G c )

= (4 π k_B G M^2 )/( ħ c )

Hmm, but perhaps that won't help me much here. Alternatively, I can compute M from the given R.

Because R = 2 G M / c^2 → M = R c²/(2 G).

We found R to be approximately 2.65e7 meters.

So M = (2.65e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 *6.67e-11 m^3/kg/s²)

Compute numerator:2.65e7 *9e16 = 2.385e24 m^3/s².

Denominator:2 *6.67e-11 =1.334e-10.

So M = 2.385e24 /1.334e-10 =approx 1.786e34 kg.

Now, entropy S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

We can also compute it via M.

S = (k_B c^3/(4 ħ G)) * A.

A = 4 π R² =4 π (2.65e7)^2 =approx 8.83e15 m².

So again, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the area in Planck units.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mistake is in the calculation of R. Let me recheck.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. Convert to radians: 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 5.23599e-19 radians.

Distance d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

Size = θ *d =5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 = approximately 1.61e8 m.

Wait, wait a minute! Wait, 5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 = let's compute exponents: 3.086e26 is 3.086 *1e26, and 5.23599e-19 is 5.23599e-19.

Multiply 5.23599e-19 *3.086e26.

5.23599 *3.086 ≈ 16.13.

Exponents: e(-19+26) =e7.

So size=16.13e7 m =1.613e8 m.

Wait, that's 1.613e8 meters. So that's the diameter. So R is half of that: 8.065e7 meters.

Wait, this is different from what I had earlier. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, initial step:

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad =θ_deg * (π/180) =1e-17 * π/180 ≈5.23599e-19 radians.

d=1e10 parsec =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

Size (diameter) =θ_rad *d =5.23599e-19 *3.086e26.

Compute this:

5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 =5.23599 *3.086 *1e7.

5.23599 *3.086 ≈ 16.13.

So size =16.13e7 m =1.613e8 m.

Thus, R =8.065e7 m.

Then area A=4π R² =4 * π * (8.065e7)^2.

(8.065e7)^2 =65.04e14 =6.504e15 m².

Multiply by 4π: 4 *3.1416 *6.504e15 ≈12.566 *6.504e15 ≈82.06e15 =8.206e16 m².

Wait, that's a much larger area than before. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Initially, I thought that θ_rad was 1.745e-19, but that's when I multiplied 1e-17 * π/(180) which is 1e-17 * 0.0174532925 ≈1.7453e-19. So that's correct.

But then when I computed size = θ_rad * d, I think I miscalculated. Because earlier, I thought size was 5.37e7 m, but this time it's 1.61e8 m.

Wait, let me compute 5.23599e-19 *3.086e26.

5.23599e-19 *3.086e26 = (5.23599 *3.086) *1e7 → 16.13 *1e7 →1.613e8 m. So diameter is 1.613e8 m, so R is 8.065e7 m.

So area is 4π R² →4 * π * (8.065e7)^2.

Compute R squared: (8.065e7)^2 =65.04e14 =6.504e15 m².

Multiply by 4π: 4 *3.1416 *6.504e15 ≈12.566 *6.504e15 ≈82.06e15 m² =8.206e16 m².

Ah, that's a much larger area than before. So I must have made a mistake earlier in the size calculation, which led to a much smaller area and thus lower entropy.

Wait, so why did I get a much smaller size earlier? Oh, I think I confused parsecs and something else. Let me recheck.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the size the first time. Wait, in the first calculation, I thought that the size was 5.37e7 meters, but that's incorrect. The correct calculation gives size =1.6e8 meters. So the earlier calculation was wrong because I forgot that 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters, so 5.235e-19 *3.086e26 is indeed about 1.6e8 meters.

So with the correct R, we can recompute the entropy.

So A=8.206e16 m².

Now, compute S= (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

c=3e8 m/s.

A=8.206e16 m².

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

So numerator:1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *8.206e16.

Compute (3e8)^3=27e24=2.7e25.

1.38e-23 *2.7e25= (1.38 *2.7) *1e2=3.726e2=372.6.

372.6 *8.206e16= 372.6 *8.206 ≈ 3055. So 3055e16=3.055e19.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11=7.04e-45.

Multiply by 4: 4 *7.04e-45=2.816e-44.

So S=3.055e19 /2.816e-44 = (3.055/2.816) *1e(19+44) → approx 1.085 *1e63 →1.085e63 J/K.

Which is approximately 1e63, which is between options A (1e62) and D (1e65). But none of the options exactly match. Wait, but perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute the numerator and denominator accurately.

Compute numerator:

1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 =1.38e-23 *2.7e25= (1.38 *2.7) *1e2 → 3.726e2=372.6.

372.6 *8.206e16=372.6 *8.206 = ?

Compute 372.6 *8 = 2980.8, 372.6 *0.206= 76.7556. So total is 3057.5556.

So 3057.5556e16 =3.0575556e19.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457*6.6743) *1e-45 → approx 7.04e-45.

Multiply by4: 4 *7.04e-45 =2.816e-44.

So S=3.0575556e19 / 2.816e-44.

3.0575556e19 /2.816e-44 = (3.0575556 /2.816) ) *1e(19+44) → approx 1.085 *1e63 →1.085e63 J/K.

So order of magnitude is 1e63. But the options don't have that. The options are A)1e62, B)1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me recompute A.

R=8.065e7 m.

R²= (8.065e7)^2 = (8.065)^2 * (1e7)^2 →8.065^2 is about 65.04 →65.04e14 =6.504e15 m².

A=4π R²=4 *3.1416 *6.504e15=12.566 *6.504e15=82.06e15=8.206e16 m².

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but then the numerator:1.38e-23 *2.7e25=3.726e2.

3.726e2 *8.206e16= 3.726 *8.206e18 →30.57e18 →3.057e19.

Denominator is 2.816e-44.

So S=3.057e19 /2.816e-44= 1.085e63 J/K.

Hmm, but the options don't include 1e63. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D (1e65), but I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units of S. Let me check the formula again.

The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * k_B? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: The formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula with another approach. The Planck area is ħ G / c^4, and the entropy is S= A/(4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length.

Wait, l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ) → l_p² = ħ G / c^3.

So S = A/(4 (ħ G/c^3)) ) * (k_B c^3)/(ħ G) ) → Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) → no, earlier I thought the formula was S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Wait, but perhaps I should look up the formula correctly.

Upon checking, the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) × (k_B is Boltzmann's constant). Wait, no, another source says S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So I think the formula is correct as I used it before.

Wait, but perhaps I actually should have used S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me try that.

So with A=8.206e16 m².

Compute numerator: A c^3 =8.206e16 * (3e8)^3 =8.206e16 *2.7e24 =2.2156e41.

Divide by 4 ħ G k_B.

4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute denominator:

4 *1.05457e-34=4.218e-34.

4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 =2.815e-44.

2.815e-44 *1.38e-23 =3.897e-67.

So S=2.2156e41 /3.897e-67 = approx 5.68e107 J/K.

That can't be right. So perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Let me proceed with that, which gives S≈1e63 J/K.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the area, or perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but considering the options, the closest would be option D: 1e65.

Wait, but I got 1e63. Let me see where I could have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me recompute:

R=8.065e7 m.

R squared: (8.065e7)^2 →8.065^2=65.04, so 65.04e14 m².

A=4π *65.04e14 =4 *3.1416 *65.04e14 ≈12.566 *65.04e14 ≈820.6e14 =8.206e16 m².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when calculating S.

S= (1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *8.206e16 ) / (4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 )

Compute numerator:

3e8^3=2.7e24.

1.38e-23 *2.7e24 = 1.38 *2.7e1=3.726e1=37.26.

37.26 *8.206e16= 37.26 *8.206e16 = 305.7e16 =3.057e18.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 →4 *7.04e-45=2.816e-44.

S=3.057e18 /2.816e-44= 1.085e62 J/K.

Oh! Wait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier in the numerator calculation. Because when I compute 1.38e-23 *2.7e25, it is 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7) *1e2 = 3.726e2 = 372.6.

Wait, no! Because 2.7e25 is 2.7 *1e25. So 1e-23 *1e25 =1e2. So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25= (1.38 *2.7) *1e2 =3.726 *1e2 =372.6.

Then multiply by 8.206e16: 372.6 *8.206e16 =372.6 *8.206 *1e16.

372.6 *8.206 ≈3057. So 3057e16 =3.057e19.

Denominator:2.816e-44.

So S=3.057e19 /2.816e-44 =3.057e19 /2.816e-44 = (3.057/2.816) *1e(19+44) →approx 1.085 *1e63 →1.085e63 J/K.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance conversion.

Wait, the distance is 1e10 parsec. 1 parsec =3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs=3.086e16 *1e10 =3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest option is D) 1e65. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the mass instead. Let me try that.

We have M = R c²/(2 G).

R=8.065e7 m.

So M=(8.065e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2) / (2 *6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²)).

Compute numerator:8.065e7 *9e16 =7.2585e24.

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11=1.33486e-10.

So M=7.2585e24 /1.33486e-10 →approx 5.438e34 kg.

Now, using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

But perhaps using another approach: S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) = (k_B c^3 * (16 π G² M² )/(c^4) )) / (4 ħ G).

Simplify:

= (16 π k_B G^2 M^2 c^3) / (4 ħ G c^4 )

= (4 π k_B G M^2) / ( ħ c )

Plugging in the values:

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

M=5.438e34 kg.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So S= (4 * π *1.38e-23 *6.6743e-11 * (5.438e34)^2 ) / (1.05457e-34 *3e8 ).

Compute numerator:

4 * π ≈12.566.

12.566 *1.38e-23 ≈17.27e-23.

17.27e-23 *6.6743e-11 ≈1.155e-32.

(5.438e34)^2 =2.958e69.

So 1.155e-32 *2.958e69 =3.42e37.

Denominator: 1.05457e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

So S=3.42e37 /3.1637e-26 =1.081e63 J/K.

Again, same result. So the entropy is approximately 1e63 J/K. But the given options don't have 1e63.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation again. Let me recheck the numerator calculation.

Wait, (5.438e34 kg)^2 = (5.438)^2 *1e68 →approx 29.56e68 =2.956e69 kg².

So 4 pi k_B G M^2 =4 *3.1416 *1.38e-23 *6.6743e-11 *2.956e69.

Compute step by step:

4 *3.1416=12.566.

12.566 *1.38e-23=17.27e-23.

17.27e-23 *6.6743e-11=17.27 *6.6743=115.5 →115.5e-34.

115.5e-34 *2.956e69 =115.5 *2.956=341.7 →341.7e35 =3.417e37.

Denominator: ħ c =1.05457e-34 *3e8=3.1637e-26.

So S=3.417e37 /3.1637e-26 =1.08e63 J/K.

Hmm, same result. So why the options don't have 1e63. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step of calculating the angular size.

Wait, the problem says θ=1e-17 degrees. Let me recheck the calculation of the size.

θ=1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad=1e-17 * (π/180) ≈5.23599e-19 radians.

d=1e10 parsecs=3.086e26 m.

size= θ_rad *d =5.23599e-19 *3.086e26= (5.23599 *3.086) *1e7 →16.13 *1e7=1.613e8 m.

So diameter is 1.613e8 m; R=8.065e7 m. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to account for the fact that the angular size is the diameter, not the radius. No, because in the formula θ = size/d, size is the diameter.

Wait, no, because θ is the angular diameter, which is the diameter of the object divided by the distance. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the entropy using the Schwarzschild radius formula, and then compute the area.

The Schwarzschild radius R_s=2 G M/c².

We have R = R_s, so M=R c²/(2 G).

So M=8.065e7 m * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2*6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²)).

M=8.065e7 *9e16 / (1.33486e-10) →(7.2585e24) /1.33486e-10 →5.438e34 kg.

Then, the area A=4 pi R²=4 pi (8.065e7)^2=8.206e16 m².

So using S=(A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G):

A=8.206e16.

So S=(8.206e16 *1.38e-23 *2.7e25) / (4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11).

Compute numerator:8.206e16 *1.38e-23=1.13e-7.

1.13e-7 *2.7e25=3.051e18.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11=2.816e-44.

So S=3.051e18 /2.816e-44=1.085e62 J/K.

Wait, same result as before. So the correct answer is approximately 1e62, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that supermassive black holes have higher entropy. But perhaps the given black hole is not that massive. Because the problem states that the black hole is at a distance of 1e10 parsecs, which is 3.086e26 meters. And the angular size is 1e-17 degrees, which corresponds to a small R.

So the entropy is around 1e62 J/K, which is option A.


To determine the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A k_B c^3}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant.

### Step 1: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius \(R\)
The angular size of the event horizon is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\). To find the Schwarzschild radius \(R\), we first convert \(\theta\) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 5.23599 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The distance to the black hole is \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}\).

The size of the event horizon (diameter) is given by:

\[
\text{Diameter} = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (5.23599 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 1.613 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the Schwarzschild radius is:

\[
R = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.613 \times 10^{8}}{2} \approx 8.065 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon \(A\)
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2 = 4 \pi (8.065 \times 10^{7})^2.
\]

First, calculate \(R^2\):

\[
R^2 = (8.065 \times 10^{7})^2 \approx 6.504 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Then, calculate \(A\):

\[
A = 4 \pi (6.504 \times 10^{15}) \approx 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 6.504 \times 10^{15} \approx 8.206 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
Using the formula for entropy:

\[
S = \frac{A k_B c^3}{4 \hbar G},
\]

we substitute the constants:
- \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\),
- \(c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/(\text{kg·s}^2)\),
- \(A = 8.206 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2\).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
A k_B c^3 = (8.206 \times 10^{16}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (3 \times 10^{8})^3.
\]

\[
(3 \times 10^{8})^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{24}, \quad A k_B c^3 = (8.206 \times 10^{16}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{24}).
\]

\[
A k_B c^3 \approx 3.057 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) = 4 \cdot 7.04 \times 10^{-45} \approx 2.816 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, calculate \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{3.057 \times 10^{19}}{2.816 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 1.085 \times 10^{63} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated entropy is approximately \(10^{63} \, \text{J/K}\). However, the closest option provided is:

**A) \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\).**

Thus, the answer is:

**Answer: A**
