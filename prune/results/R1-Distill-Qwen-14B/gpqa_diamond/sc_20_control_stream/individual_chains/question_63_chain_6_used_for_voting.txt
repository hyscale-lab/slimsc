Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to make the molecule switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state right now. I remember that in the quantum models, molecules have quantized energy levels for both rotation and vibration.

So, the elements are X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The options are A to D with different momentum values.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think that means it's in the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So, the ground state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I guess that's the first excited state. But wait, which transition? Could it be a rotation transition, a vibration transition, or a combination?

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the molecule's energy is a sum of these. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model... Wait, maybe the rotational part is treated as a rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model might consider bond length changes, but for the purpose of this problem, maybe it's just about the energy levels.

Wait, maybe the question is more about the selection rules. To understand which transition is allowed, but perhaps here, the problem is more about the energy difference between states.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So, in the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state. But wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational state can't be zero because of the quantized nature. Oh no, wait, no, in the rigid rotor model, J can be 0. But wait, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). So J can be 0,1,2,... For a diatomic, the ground state is J=0, right? Or wait, I think in some cases, the ground state is J=1 because of the centrifugal distortion, but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the next state would be the next higher energy state overall. So, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0?), and it absorbs a photon that takes it to the next possible energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which transition would require a smaller photon energy?

Wait, the energy of a photon is E = hf = ħω. And the energy difference required would be the difference between the initial and final states.

Hmm, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Since E = p*c, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light, so p = E/c.

So, if I can find the energy difference ΔE between the initial and final states, then the photon's momentum would be ΔE divided by c.

But what's the initial and final state? The initial state is the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest energy could either be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Which of these has lower energy?

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = [J(J+1)] ħ² / (2I). The difference between J=0 and J=1 would be [1(2) - 0(1)] * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

So, which is larger: ħω or ħ²/(I)?

Given the numbers, let's compute both.

First, let's compute ħω. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħω is about 1.05e-34 * 4e14 = 4.22e-20 J.

Now, compute ħ²/(I). I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ²/(I) is (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.206e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, so ħω is about 4.22e-20 J, and ħ²/(I) is about 9.22e-23 J. So the vibrational energy difference is much larger than the rotational one.

So the next state with the lowest energy would be the J=1 rotational state (since it requires less energy than moving to v=1).

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So, the next possible energy increase could be either to J=1 or v=1. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that allows it to transition to J=1, but only if that's allowed.

But wait, are both transitions allowed? Or is there a selection rule that allows only certain transitions?

For rotation, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1. For vibration, Δv = ±1. So from v=0, you can go to v=1.

But what about the combination of rotational and vibrational changes? The problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be the state with the smallest ΔE. So which is smaller: E_rot(J=1) or E_vib(v=1)?

As calculated, E_rot is about 9.22e-23 J, and E_vib is 4.22e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait. The molecule's current state is the ground state. When it absorbs a photon, it can go to the next higher energy state, which would be either J=1 or v=1, whichever has smaller energy. Since the rotational change gives lower energy, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Wait, but in reality, molecules can have both rotational and vibrational transitions, and sometimes they can transition in combination. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the smallest possible ΔE.

So, the photon's energy is E = ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I). So E_photon = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for I. Let me recalculate:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Then ħ² is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2.

So ħ²/(I) = 1.1e-68 /1.206e-46 ≈ (1.1/1.206) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.912e-22 ≈ 9.12e-23 J.

So that's about 9.12e-23 J. So E_photon = 9.12e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = E / c = 9.12e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.04e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns. Hmm, kg·m/s is equivalent to Ns because 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², so Ns = kg·m/s. So the units match.

Wait, but 3.04e-31 kg·m/s is 3.04e-31 Ns. The options are all around 1e-27, which is 10^4 higher. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, did I calculate ħ²/(I) correctly? Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ²/(I).

Wait, let's recompute ħ²/(I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05)^2 = 1.1025, times 1e-68. So 1.1025e-68 J²·s².

But wait, the units for ħ²/(I) would be J²·s² / kg·m².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerical value correctly. Let me compute (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.1025e-68.

Then, I is 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I = 1.1025e-68 / 1.206e-46 = (1.1025 /1.206) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.914 * 1e-22 = 9.14e-23 J.

Wait, same as before. So E_photon is 9.14e-23 J.

Then p = E_photon / c = 9.14e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m/s) is kg·m²/s² * s/m = kg·m/s. So units are correct.

Calculating the value: 9.14e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.046e-31 kg·m/s = 3.046e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. The options are about 1e-27 Ns. So that's a factor of 1e4 higher.

Wait, maybe I got the wrong transition. Maybe the photon is absorbed by moving from J=0 to J=1 and also v=0 to v=1. Because the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state with the lowest possible energy could be a combination of both. Or perhaps the next state in the rotational-vibration model is a higher vibration state, but perhaps that's more than the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the next state is a pure rotational transition. Maybe the molecule can't directly make a pure rotational transition because of selection rules, but that's not the case. Wait, vibrational transitions usually have Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions have ΔJ=±1, but in some cases, vibrational transitions can accompany rotational changes. Hmm, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So regardless of selection rules, perhaps the lowest energy transition is the rotational one. But wait, if the selection rules don't allow a pure rotational transition, then the next possible would be a vibrational one.

Wait, wait, but in diatomic molecules, pure rotational transitions are allowed only if there's a change in the dipole moment. If the molecule is non-polar, pure rotational transitions are forbidden. But in this problem, I don't know if X and Y are polar. Hmm, the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that pure rotational transitions are allowed. But maybe not, which would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can change both rotation and vibration at the same time, leading to a lower total energy than each individual transition.

Wait, maybe the question is about the fundamental vibration-rotation state, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The E_vib is (v + ½) ħω, and E_rot is [J(J+1)] ħ²/(2I).

So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are:

- v=0, J=1. ΔE = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(0) = (1*2) * (ħ²/(2I)) - 0 = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

- v=1, J=0. ΔE = ( (1 + ½) ħω ) - ( (0 + ½) ħω ) = ħω.

- v=1, J=1. ΔE = [ (1) ħω + (2) * (ħ²/(2I) ) ] - [ (½ ħω) + 0 ].

Wait, but that's a combination. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the state with the smallest ΔE.

Earlier, we saw that the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) requires less energy than the vibrational (v=0→v=1). Therefore, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

But wait, if pure rotational transitions are not allowed (perhaps because the dipole moment doesn't change), then the molecule would have to absorb a photon that induces a vibrational transition or a vibrational and rotational transition. But the problem states that it's using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both, so perhaps the selection rules allow for both.

Wait, but in any case, the energy required for the transition would be the one with the smallest ΔE. So even if you can't have a pure rotational transition, the next would be a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, in this case, if the rotational transition is allowed, it's the lower energy photon needed, so that's the answer. Otherwise, if it's not allowed, the photon would need to match the vibrational energy.

But in the problem statement, there's no mention of selection rules, so perhaps we can assume that both transitions are allowed, and the molecule will choose the transition with the lower energy, which is the rotational one.

Wait, but earlier, I calculated the rotational photon energy as 9.14e-23 J, which gives a momentum of about 3e-31 Ns, which doesn't match any of the options. The options are around 1e-27 Ns, which is four orders of magnitude higher. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me re-calculate I.

I = μ R². μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2 ) / 22 =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = Let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.015. So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ² is (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 (J^2 s^2) = approx 1.112e-68 J^2 s^2.

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 = (1.112 / 1.206) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.922e-22 = 9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Then, p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, that's 3.07e-31, but the options are 1e-27 and above. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the transition is a vibrational one, not a rotational one.

Because, perhaps the rotational energy is too small, but in reality, the vibrational energy is higher, so the photon needs to have the energy difference of the vibrational transition.

Wait, but that would make the photon energy E = ħω = 4.22e-20 J, which would give p = (4.22e-20) / (3e8) ≈ 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's very close.

Wait, so perhaps the molecule can't make a pure rotational transition, so the next possible state is the vibrational transition.

But why would that be the case? Because in some molecules, rotational transitions are not allowed if they are nonpolar. But if the molecule is polar, then pure rotational transitions are allowed, but they require lower energy.

But in this problem, perhaps the model assumes that the first allowed transition is a vibrational one because, for some reason, rotational transitions are not allowed.

Wait, but the question says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which accounts for both. So the molecule can change either rotationally or vibrationally, whichever requires less energy.

But earlier, the rotational transition required less energy than the vibrational one. So the photon would be 9e-23 J, which doesn't match any option.

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe I should have considered the change in energy when both rotational and vibrational states change. Like, perhaps the next state is v=1 and J=1.

Wait, but that would be a combination. Let's calculate its energy.

E_vib(v=1) = (1 + ½) ħω = (3/2) ħω ≈ 6.33e-20 J.

E_rot(J=1) = (1)(2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/I ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So the total E when both change would be 6.33e-20 + 9.22e-23 ≈ 6.42e-20 J.

But that's higher than the vibrational transition alone. So the next state with the lowest energy would still be the rotational transition.

Hmm, but since the rotational transition requires a photon of momentum about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option, perhaps I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Raman effect, where the molecule changes both vibrational and rotational states, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the energy difference between the ground vibrational state (v=0, J=0) and the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0). That would require the energy difference of ħω, which is 4.22e-20 J.

So p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns, which matches option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because maybe it's not allowed. So perhaps in this molecule, the rotational transitions are not allowed, so the photon must provide the vibrational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that would have higher energy than either alone.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we have to find the photon to make it switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy above the fundamental.

So, if the molecule can make a rotational transition with a lower energy, that's the next state. But if that's not allowed, the next is the vibrational.

But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires a photon of ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is considering a vibrational transition, leading to option D.

Wait, but why would the rotational transition not be allowed? Because maybe the molecule is symmetric, like O2 or N2, which are homonuclear and have no dipole moment, making pure rotational transitions forbidden. But in that case, the problem states it's a diatomic with elements X and Y, which are presumably different, so the molecule is polar, allowing pure rotational transitions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is not considering a pure rotational transition, but a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the vibrational energy difference, as that's the only option that gives a momentum that matches one of the answer choices.

So, if I compute the photon energy as ħω, which is 4.22e-20 J, then the momentum is 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s, which is 1.407e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, so that's the answer.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy difference.

E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (1)(2) * ħ²/(2I) ) ] - 0 = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ² / I.

Wait, I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which introduces a correction to the rotational energy based on bond vibrations. But I don't think that affects the calculation of the energy difference for the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotation. That would make the photon's energy ħω, leading to option D.

Wait, but why would the problem ignore the rotational transition? Because the question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So it should consider both.

Unless, perhaps, the question is incorrectly assuming that the only transition possible is vibrational, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

I = μ R². μ is 3.015e-27 kg. R is 2e-10 m.

I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² is 1.11e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.11e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy is 9.2e-23 J. Momentum is 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are much larger, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is calculated incorrectly. Oh wait! Because R is given in angstroms, I think I might have miscalculated R in meters.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reduced mass μ is not (Mx * My)/(Mx + My), but perhaps I'm using the wrong value. Let me double-check.

Yes, for a diatomic molecule, the reduced mass is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the units for the bond length R are in a different unit. Wait, the problem says R is 2 angstroms. Yes, that's 2e-10 m.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, but I think I used that correctly.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is actually about the vibrational energy, because the rotational energy is much smaller, but the answer choices correspond to the vibrational transition.

So, if the photon has energy ħω = 4.22e-20 J, then p = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu = 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Moment of inertia**: \( I = \mu R^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \)
- **Planck's constant**: \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Energy Differences:
1. **Rotational transition**: The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

2. **Vibrational transition**: The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) and \( v = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)). However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p_{\text{rot}} \)) does not match any of the provided answer choices.
- The vibrational transition momentum (\( p_{\text{vib}} \)) matches option **D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).
- It is possible that the problem assumes the vibrational transition is the relevant one, despite the rotational transition requiring less energy. This discrepancy may arise from selection rules or other constraints not explicitly stated in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The photon momentum required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy is consistent with the vibrational transition.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to make the molecule switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state right now. I remember that in the quantum models, molecules have quantized energy levels for both rotation and vibration.

So, the elements are X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The options are A to D with different momentum values.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think that means it's in the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So, the ground state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I guess that's the first excited state. But wait, which transition? Could it be a rotation transition, a vibration transition, or a combination?

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the molecule's energy is a sum of these. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model... Wait, maybe the rotational part is treated as a rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model might consider bond length changes, but for the purpose of this problem, maybe it's just about the energy levels.

Wait, maybe the question is more about the selection rules. To understand which transition is allowed, but perhaps here, the problem is more about the energy difference between states.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So, in the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state. But wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational state can't be zero because of the quantized nature. Oh no, wait, no, in the rigid rotor model, J can be 0. But wait, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). So J can be 0,1,2,... For a diatomic, the ground state is J=0, right? Or wait, I think in some cases, the ground state is J=1 because of the centrifugal distortion, but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the next state would be the next higher energy state overall. So, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0?), and it absorbs a photon that takes it to the next possible energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which transition would require a smaller photon energy?

Wait, the energy of a photon is E = hf = ħω. And the energy difference required would be the difference between the initial and final states.

Hmm, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Since E = p*c, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light, so p = E/c.

So, if I can find the energy difference ΔE between the initial and final states, then the photon's momentum would be ΔE divided by c.

But what's the initial and final state? The initial state is the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest energy could either be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Which of these has lower energy?

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = [J(J+1)] ħ² / (2I). The difference between J=0 and J=1 would be [1(2) - 0(1)] * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

So, which is larger: ħω or ħ²/(I)?

Given the numbers, let's compute both.

First, let's compute ħω. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħω is about 1.05e-34 * 4e14 = 4.22e-20 J.

Now, compute ħ²/(I). I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ²/(I) is (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.206e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, so ħω is about 4.22e-20 J, and ħ²/(I) is about 9.22e-23 J. So the vibrational energy difference is much larger than the rotational one.

So the next state with the lowest energy would be the J=1 rotational state (since it requires less energy than moving to v=1).

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So, the next possible energy increase could be either to J=1 or v=1. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that allows it to transition to J=1, but only if that's allowed.

But wait, are both transitions allowed? Or is there a selection rule that allows only certain transitions?

For rotation, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1. For vibration, Δv = ±1. So from v=0, you can go to v=1.

But what about the combination of rotational and vibrational changes? The problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be the state with the smallest ΔE. So which is smaller: E_rot(J=1) or E_vib(v=1)?

As calculated, E_rot is about 9.22e-23 J, and E_vib is 4.22e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait. The molecule's current state is the ground state. When it absorbs a photon, it can go to the next higher energy state, which would be either J=1 or v=1, whichever has smaller energy. Since the rotational change gives lower energy, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Wait, but in reality, molecules can have both rotational and vibrational transitions, and sometimes they can transition in combination. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the smallest possible ΔE.

So, the photon's energy is E = ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I). So E_photon = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for I. Let me recalculate:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Then ħ² is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2.

So ħ²/(I) = 1.1e-68 /1.206e-46 ≈ (1.1/1.206) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.912e-22 ≈ 9.12e-23 J.

So that's about 9.12e-23 J. So E_photon = 9.12e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = E / c = 9.12e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.04e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns. Hmm, kg·m/s is equivalent to Ns because 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², so Ns = kg·m/s. So the units match.

Wait, but 3.04e-31 kg·m/s is 3.04e-31 Ns. The options are all around 1e-27, which is 10^4 higher. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, did I calculate ħ²/(I) correctly? Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ²/(I).

Wait, let's recompute ħ²/(I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05)^2 = 1.1025, times 1e-68. So 1.1025e-68 J²·s².

But wait, the units for ħ²/(I) would be J²·s² / kg·m².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerical value correctly. Let me compute (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.1025e-68.

Then, I is 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I = 1.1025e-68 / 1.206e-46 = (1.1025 /1.206) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.914 * 1e-22 = 9.14e-23 J.

Wait, same as before. So E_photon is 9.14e-23 J.

Then p = E_photon / c = 9.14e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m/s) is kg·m²/s² * s/m = kg·m/s. So units are correct.

Calculating the value: 9.14e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.046e-31 kg·m/s = 3.046e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. The options are about 1e-27 Ns. So that's a factor of 1e4 higher.

Wait, maybe I got the wrong transition. Maybe the photon is absorbed by moving from J=0 to J=1 and also v=0 to v=1. Because the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state with the lowest possible energy could be a combination of both. Or perhaps the next state in the rotational-vibration model is a higher vibration state, but perhaps that's more than the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the next state is a pure rotational transition. Maybe the molecule can't directly make a pure rotational transition because of selection rules, but that's not the case. Wait, vibrational transitions usually have Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions have ΔJ=±1, but in some cases, vibrational transitions can accompany rotational changes. Hmm, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So regardless of selection rules, perhaps the lowest energy transition is the rotational one. But wait, if the selection rules don't allow a pure rotational transition, then the next possible would be a vibrational one.

Wait, wait, but in diatomic molecules, pure rotational transitions are allowed only if there's a change in the dipole moment. If the molecule is non-polar, pure rotational transitions are forbidden. But in this problem, I don't know if X and Y are polar. Hmm, the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that pure rotational transitions are allowed. But maybe not, which would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can change both rotation and vibration at the same time, leading to a lower total energy than each individual transition.

Wait, maybe the question is about the fundamental vibration-rotation state, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The E_vib is (v + ½) ħω, and E_rot is [J(J+1)] ħ²/(2I).

So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are:

- v=0, J=1. ΔE = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(0) = (1*2) * (ħ²/(2I)) - 0 = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

- v=1, J=0. ΔE = ( (1 + ½) ħω ) - ( (0 + ½) ħω ) = ħω.

- v=1, J=1. ΔE = [ (1) ħω + (2) * (ħ²/(2I) ) ] - [ (½ ħω) + 0 ].

Wait, but that's a combination. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the state with the smallest ΔE.

Earlier, we saw that the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) requires less energy than the vibrational (v=0→v=1). Therefore, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

But wait, if pure rotational transitions are not allowed (perhaps because the dipole moment doesn't change), then the molecule would have to absorb a photon that induces a vibrational transition or a vibrational and rotational transition. But the problem states that it's using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both, so perhaps the selection rules allow for both.

Wait, but in any case, the energy required for the transition would be the one with the smallest ΔE. So even if you can't have a pure rotational transition, the next would be a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, in this case, if the rotational transition is allowed, it's the lower energy photon needed, so that's the answer. Otherwise, if it's not allowed, the photon would need to match the vibrational energy.

But in the problem statement, there's no mention of selection rules, so perhaps we can assume that both transitions are allowed, and the molecule will choose the transition with the lower energy, which is the rotational one.

Wait, but earlier, I calculated the rotational photon energy as 9.14e-23 J, which gives a momentum of about 3e-31 Ns, which doesn't match any of the options. The options are around 1e-27 Ns, which is four orders of magnitude higher. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me re-calculate I.

I = μ R². μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2 ) / 22 =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = Let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.015. So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ² is (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 (J^2 s^2) = approx 1.112e-68 J^2 s^2.

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 = (1.112 / 1.206) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.922e-22 = 9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Then, p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, that's 3.07e-31, but the options are 1e-27 and above. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the transition is a vibrational one, not a rotational one.

Because, perhaps the rotational energy is too small, but in reality, the vibrational energy is higher, so the photon needs to have the energy difference of the vibrational transition.

Wait, but that would make the photon energy E = ħω = 4.22e-20 J, which would give p = (4.22e-20) / (3e8) ≈ 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's very close.

Wait, so perhaps the molecule can't make a pure rotational transition, so the next possible state is the vibrational transition.

But why would that be the case? Because in some molecules, rotational transitions are not allowed if they are nonpolar. But if the molecule is polar, then pure rotational transitions are allowed, but they require lower energy.

But in this problem, perhaps the model assumes that the first allowed transition is a vibrational one because, for some reason, rotational transitions are not allowed.

Wait, but the question says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which accounts for both. So the molecule can change either rotationally or vibrationally, whichever requires less energy.

But earlier, the rotational transition required less energy than the vibrational one. So the photon would be 9e-23 J, which doesn't match any option.

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe I should have considered the change in energy when both rotational and vibrational states change. Like, perhaps the next state is v=1 and J=1.

Wait, but that would be a combination. Let's calculate its energy.

E_vib(v=1) = (1 + ½) ħω = (3/2) ħω ≈ 6.33e-20 J.

E_rot(J=1) = (1)(2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/I ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So the total E when both change would be 6.33e-20 + 9.22e-23 ≈ 6.42e-20 J.

But that's higher than the vibrational transition alone. So the next state with the lowest energy would still be the rotational transition.

Hmm, but since the rotational transition requires a photon of momentum about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option, perhaps I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Raman effect, where the molecule changes both vibrational and rotational states, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the energy difference between the ground vibrational state (v=0, J=0) and the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0). That would require the energy difference of ħω, which is 4.22e-20 J.

So p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns, which matches option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because maybe it's not allowed. So perhaps in this molecule, the rotational transitions are not allowed, so the photon must provide the vibrational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that would have higher energy than either alone.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we have to find the photon to make it switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy above the fundamental.

So, if the molecule can make a rotational transition with a lower energy, that's the next state. But if that's not allowed, the next is the vibrational.

But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires a photon of ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is considering a vibrational transition, leading to option D.

Wait, but why would the rotational transition not be allowed? Because maybe the molecule is symmetric, like O2 or N2, which are homonuclear and have no dipole moment, making pure rotational transitions forbidden. But in that case, the problem states it's a diatomic with elements X and Y, which are presumably different, so the molecule is polar, allowing pure rotational transitions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is not considering a pure rotational transition, but a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the vibrational energy difference, as that's the only option that gives a momentum that matches one of the answer choices.

So, if I compute the photon energy as ħω, which is 4.22e-20 J, then the momentum is 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s, which is 1.407e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, so that's the answer.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy difference.

E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (1)(2) * ħ²/(2I) ) ] - 0 = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ² / I.

Wait, I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which introduces a correction to the rotational energy based on bond vibrations. But I don't think that affects the calculation of the energy difference for the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotation. That would make the photon's energy ħω, leading to option D.

Wait, but why would the problem ignore the rotational transition? Because the question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So it should consider both.

Unless, perhaps, the question is incorrectly assuming that the only transition possible is vibrational, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

I = μ R². μ is 3.015e-27 kg. R is 2e-10 m.

I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² is 1.11e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.11e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy is 9.2e-23 J. Momentum is 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are much larger, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is calculated incorrectly. Oh wait! Because R is given in angstroms, I think I might have miscalculated R in meters.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reduced mass μ is not (Mx * My)/(Mx + My), but perhaps I'm using the wrong value. Let me double-check.

Yes, for a diatomic molecule, the reduced mass is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the units for the bond length R are in a different unit. Wait, the problem says R is 2 angstroms. Yes, that's 2e-10 m.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, but I think I used that correctly.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is actually about the vibrational energy, because the rotational energy is much smaller, but the answer choices correspond to the vibrational transition.

So, if the photon has energy ħω = 4.22e-20 J, then p = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu = 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Moment of inertia**: \( I = \mu R^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \)
- **Planck's constant**: \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Energy Differences:
1. **Rotational transition**: The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

2. **Vibrational transition**: The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) and \( v = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)). However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p_{\text{rot}} \)) does not match any of the provided answer choices.
- The vibrational transition momentum (\( p_{\text{vib}} \)) matches option **D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).
- It is possible that the problem assumes the vibrational transition is the relevant one, despite the rotational transition requiring less energy. This discrepancy may arise from selection rules or other constraints not explicitly stated in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The photon momentum required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy is consistent with the vibrational transition.
