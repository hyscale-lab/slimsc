Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Oh wait, but the main question is about two different properties: tautomerism and optical isomerism. Right, I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds, leading to different structural isomers. And optical isomerism has to do with chiral centers, right? Molecules that are not superimposable on their mirror images, so they can rotate plane-polarized light.

The question is divided into two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think tautomerism requires the presence of adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can shift. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, right? Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketones. Wait, no, benzoquinone is more like a di- or tri-ketone? I think benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic structure with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, making a 1,4-diketone perhaps? Or maybe 1,2? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups in a symmetrical arrangement. So all three are on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring. Wait, 1,3,5-trione would have ketones on carbons 1, 3, and 5, which are all alternate positions—so they're not adjacent. So each is separated by one carbon. So in that case, the structure would have three non-adjacent ketone groups, but each is across from each other.

Tautomerism, like in diketones, happens when you have adjacent carbonyl groups. Because that allows for the movement of a hydrogen between adjacent atoms, leading to a keto-enol tautomer. So if a compound has two adjacent ketone groups, like 1,2-diketone, then tautomerism is possible. For example, benzil is 1,2-diketone and can tautomerize.

Benzoquinone, if it's a 1,4-diketone, then the two ketone groups are not adjacent. Wait, 1,4 on a benzene ring would be across from each other. So the rings would be at positions 1 and 4, which are opposite. So maybe that's not adjacent. So if benzoquinone has ketones in positions that are not adjacent, then it can't tautomerize. Alternatively, if they are adjacent, then it can.

Wait, I might be confusing benzoquinone. Let me think again. Benzoquinone can be 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. Oh right, so there are two forms. The 1,2 has adjacent ketone groups, so that can tautomerize. But 1,4 would have the ketones opposite each other, so they can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent H to shift.

Wait, but the question is about whether the compound shows tautomerism. So if benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't undergo tautomerism. But I'm not sure if benzoquinone is 1,2 or 1,4. Wait, I recall that in organic chemistry, quinones are often 1,4-diketones. For example, para-benzoquinone is 1,4, which can't tautomerize because the ketones are not adjacent. Whereas 1,2 would allow keto-enol tautomerism.

So wait, the two options for A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Which one doesn't show tautomerism. If benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't tautomerize. What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the three ketone groups are at positions 1,3,5. So each is separated by a CH2 group. So each is adjacent in the ring to a CH2, but not directly next to another ketone. So in this case, any two ketones are two carbons apart. So can they undergo tautomerism? I think tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups with a hydrogen in between. So perhaps in this case, each ketone is separated by a CH2, so no adjacent H to shift. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism either?

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe if there are three ketones in a row, like 1,2,3-trione, then they can tautomerize. But 1,3,5 are every other position, so that's not adjacent. So in that case, neither benzoquinone (1,4) nor cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have adjacent ketones, so neither can tautomerize. But the question is about which one does not show tautomerism. Wait, but the question is that one of them doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: tautomerism occurs when there's a possibility for hydrogen shift between adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, in 1,2-diketones, like diketones, tautomerism is possible. But if the two carbonyls are not adjacent, then it's not possible.

So, for benzoquinone, if it's 1,4, then the two ketones are opposite each other on the benzene ring; they are not adjacent. So tautomerism is not possible. So benzoquinone cannot tautomerize. What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? It has three ketones, each separated by a CH2. So no two are adjacent. So tautomerism is not possible. Hmm, but the question states that among these two, the one that does NOT show tautomerism is A. So either both don't show it, which can't be, because the options suggest one or the other.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the structures again.

Benzoquinone, 1,4- would have two ketone groups across from each other on the benzene ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=C=O, with the two ketones at opposite ends.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones in a six-membered ring, each at 1,3,5 positions. So the structure is a ring with O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO- or something like that. Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. 1,3,5-trione would have ketones on carbons 1, 3, and 5. Each of these is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So each ketone is flanked by CH2 groups.

In such a structure, could a hydrogen shift occur between any two carbonyl groups? Let's imagine carbon 1 is a ketone (C=O), carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is another ketone, and so on. So the carbonyls are at every other carbon. So they are not adjacent. So no adjacent hydrogens to shift. Therefore, neither compound can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question says that one of them does not show tautomerism. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that benzoquinone doesn't show it. Maybe benzoquinone is a 1,2-diketone, allowing tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize but the trione can.

Wait, maybe I should look up the structure of benzoquinone. Oh wait, in reality, benzoquinone can exist as 1,2 and 1,4 isomers. The 1,2 isomer is also called para-benzoquinone, but actually, no, 1,2 is ortho, and 1,4 is para. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. In benzene ring numbering, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 1 and 4 are across.

So 1,2-benzoquinone has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons—so it can undergo tautomerism. But 1,4 cannot. So if the question refers to benzoquinone without specifying, perhaps it's referring to 1,4, which can't. But it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that benzoquinone is a 1,4-diketone, so it cannot undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't either. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about part B and come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism happens when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different groups attached to a carbon. Alternatively, meso compounds can't show optical isomerism because they have a plane of symmetry.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-COOH? Or wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Its ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. So the carbonyl is in the middle. So, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-something? Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- CH3 (from the CH2)
- and another CH2.

Wait, no, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-O
   |   |
   OH  CH3

Wait, perhaps better to draw it as:

The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when you make the methyl ester, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3

The central carbon is the second carbon (CH2), but wait, that's a CH2 group, so each carbon is CH2, so no chiral centers. Wait, wait. Wait, the second carbon is connected to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group? Or is the structure different?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2 with OH, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group attached? Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2, so each attached group is:

- OH
- COOCH3
- CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me number the carbons. The propanoate ester would have three carbons: COOCH3 is the first, then a CH2, then another CH2 with OH.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the backbone is:

COOCH3 — CH2 — CH2OH

So the middle carbon is the CH2 between COOCH3 and CH2OH. So that central carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3 group (on one side)
- two CH2 groups (one from the COOCH3, another to the OH)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the central carbon is actually the middle of the three carbons. Wait, no, no. Wait, the molecule is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH

So the central carbon is the middle CH2. So its four groups are:

- COOCH3 (from the left)
- CH2OH (from the right)
- two H's.

Wait, no, wait, each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon is CH2, so attached to:

- COOCH3 group,
- CH2OH group,
- two H's.

So that's only three different groups, and two H's. Therefore, it's not a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH, then the ester group is on the first carbon, and the second carbon has two CH2 groups. So the second carbon is CH2, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the first CH2 after the COOCH3. So that carbon is CH2, so it's attached to COOCH3, another CH2 (which then leads to OH), and two H's. Again, that's not a chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, what about dimethyl fumarate? Fumaric acid is a diacid, and its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumaric acid is a diene with two carboxylic acid groups on each end.

Structure of fumaric acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is a trans-dienoic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, where each COOH is esterified with methanol, leading to:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not right. No, wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, perhaps better to write as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So dimethyl fumarate has the structure:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)

But wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

No, that's not the case. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the double bond is between the two CH groups. So when esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3.

So the structure becomes CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, I'm getting this wrong again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the two COOH groups are at the ends of a double bond. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait, that's succinic acid. No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is a diacid with a double bond between the two central carbons.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each -COOH is converted to -COOCH3. So the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no, the double bond is present. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But that can't be right because the double bond was in the acid. So the ester would have the same double bond. So it's:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no. So it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But the double bond is between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is actually a trans-diepoxy structure. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. The structure of fumarate is:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me look it up in my mind. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester dimethyl fumarate would have:

COOCH3 groups on each end, connected by a double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's succinate. Fumarate would have a double bond, so it's:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. No, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So each end is COOCH3, connected by a double bond.

Wait, no, the actual structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's without a double bond. No, wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). No, actually, fumarate is a trans-diepoxy, so the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Fumarate is a diepoxy compound with a double bond. So dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on either side of a double bond. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain? Hmm.

Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH

So when you esterify both COOH groups with methanol, you get:

CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, that would be a three-carbon structure? Hmm, no, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct either. I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the symmetry.

Now, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond between the two CH groups, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is (COOCH3)₂CH=CH.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, it's (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). So the two COOCH3 groups are on either end of the double bond, but on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps that's the structure. So the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, making it a trans configuration, or opposite?

Wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So when you esterify them, the two COOCH3 groups would be on opposite sides as well.

So the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this structure have a plane of symmetry? Let me see.

If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no, because each has a COOCH3 group, but if they are on opposite sides, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Or perhaps it's not, leading to the possibility of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomerism. So, for example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, then it won't have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has two COOCH3 groups attached to each end of the double bond. If the substituents on each side are the same, and if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and won't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric. So in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (COOCH3)₂, with each COOCH3 attached to a CH on each side of the double bond.

Wait, so if the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond, it's:

COOCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, in that case, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me see. If you imagine a vertical plane through the double bond, the substituents on either side (both COOCH3) are mirror images, so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's a meso compound and doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are in a trans configuration, then the molecule is actually symmetrical. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: if a compound has two identical groups on either side of a double bond, and the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two COOH groups on each end, making it symmetrical.

So in dimethyl fumarate, if the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, would that create a chiral center? No, because each carbon is attached to two identical groups. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, in the structure (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Alternatively, let's imagine the structure. Each of the two central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each CH has a COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in that case, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and two CH groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

In that case, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3, two CH₂ groups, and a hydrogen? No, wait, each of those carbons would have a COOCH3, two CH₂ groups, and a double bond. I think I'm getting too confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. No, that's not right. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the diester, so each COOH becomes COOCH3.

So, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So each of the two middle carbons (in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH group. Each of those CH groups is attached to another COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) has the following groups:

- COOCH3
- another COOCH3 from the other end
- two CH groups.

Wait, no, I'm mixing up the structure. Let me try to imagine it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that's not possible because CH₂=CH₂ is ethene. So dimethyl fumarate would be O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3 with a double bond, making it O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

In this case, each of the middle carbons (the CH in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3, a CH group, and two H's. Wait, but in that case, each of these carbons would have two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH), so they're not chiral centers. But wait, if each of those carbons is attached to two different groups, perhaps they are chiral centers.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- another CH (from the double bond)
- two H's.

So each has two H's, a COOCH3, and a CH. So they’re attached to two identical groups (the H's and the CH), so no, they’re not chiral centers.

Wait, but if the double bond is between two carbons each attached to a COOCH3 group, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound. Wait, what's the structure again. If the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, then the molecule would not be symmetrical. Or if they're on opposite sides, it would be symmetrical.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the structure symmetrical. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that would mean that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism either. But that can't be right because I thought fumarate could form enantiomers.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about this differently. If a molecule has a double bond with identical substituents on each end, and it's trans, then it's symmetrical. So in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3), and the molecule is trans, making it symmetrical. That would mean it's a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

But I'm getting confused. Another approach: let's think about the possibility of enantiomers. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and won't have enantiomers. If not, it can have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a symmetrical structure. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: maybe dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a meso compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetrical.

Wait, let me think of another way. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. So each half mirrors the other, so it's a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, then, which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism?

Earlier, I thought methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being a meso compound, also doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's a problem because the question is asking which one does show optical isomerism. So I must have made a mistake.

Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake with the structures.

Wait, another approach: let's think about whether the compounds have any chiral centers.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (the second CH2) is attached to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3. So, the groups are: two CH2 (same), OH, COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (the two CH2), so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

In dimethyl fumarate: if the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, each of the two middle carbons (connected by the double bond) are attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, but each of these is connected to two CH groups. No, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and two CH groups. Wait, no, each of the double-bond carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- another CH (from the double bond)
- two H's.

So each is attached to two H's, which are identical. So each of these carbons only has three different groups: COOCH3, H, and the other CH. Wait, but that would mean each has three groups, but wait, the double bond restricts rotation, so perhaps each carbon has four substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and the adjacent CH group. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other atoms (the adjacent carbons), so in reality, each has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and the double bond. So no, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps neither compound has a chiral center, but that can't be because the question asks which one does. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound. Let me think about it again. If the substituents on each end are the same, and the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound. But if not, it's not.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, and the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound. So dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then neither of the two compounds in part B exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the question is asking which one does.

I must have made a mistake in analyzing the structures.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual compounds. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl glycolate. Glycolic acid is HOCH2COOH, so the ester would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, each of the carbons in the chain:

- The first carbon is CH2OH.

- The second carbon is CH2 connected to the first and the third.

- The third carbon is COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (the second one) is CH2, attached to two CH2 groups, one OH, and one COOCH3. Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- two H's.

Wait, so the groups are:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So four substituents: two H's, CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. Are any of these identical? The two H's are identical, but the other two groups are different. So the second carbon has two H's and two different groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the H's). So no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about another possibility. Maybe the structure is such that the middle carbon has four different groups. For example, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, no, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me number the carbons again. propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- OH group,
- two CH2 groups,
- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, the middle carbon is attached to:

- The first CH2 (CH2OH)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- two H's.

So, the substituents are:

- CH2OH
- COOCH3
- two H's.

So, the groups are CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. Since two H's are the same, this carbon isn't a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

But then, what about dimethyl fumarate? If it's a meso compound, it won't show optical isomerism. So neither of them do, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another possibility. What if dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound? Let me think.

If the two substituents on the double bond are the same (COOCH3), but the molecule isn't symmetrical, then the molecule could have a chiral center.

Wait, but if the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical, then it's a meso compound. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't.

Wait, but according to my analysis, neither do. So I'm probably wrong. What else could I be missing?

Wait, perhaps in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents. Let me visualize it again. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH2. So attached groups are:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

No, that's three substituents, but it's a CH2 group, so two H's. So no, not a chiral center.

Then, what about dimethyl fumarate? If it's a trans-diesters, could it have a chiral center?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the molecule has two identical groups on each end, making it a meso compound, so no optical isomerism. So the correct answer for part B would be dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't. But the question is which one does show it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Maybe it doesn't have a plane of symmetry, thus allowing for optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually (COOCH3)₂CH=CH. So each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each of these carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- another CH group
- two H's.

So each has three substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and another CH. Wait, but this would imply that each has two identical substituents (the H's), so they're not chiral centers.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to find another approach. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So for part A, the correct answer is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't tautomerize, so A would be benzoquinone. Then, in part B, perhaps dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism, making option D correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so it doesn't. Alternatively, if dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with maleate. Maleate is a cis diacid, and when esterified, its diester can show optical isomerism because it has two identical ester groups on the same side, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, but fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate, being trans, has the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Thus, it's a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, then in part B, neither compound shows optical isomerism, which can't be right because the question is asking which one does.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps it's better to conclude that option D is correct, where A is benzoquinone (which doesn't tautomerize) and B is dimethyl fumarate, which does show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck and proceed to make an educated guess.

So, going back to part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't. So A would be benzoquinone.

In part B, dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So the answer would be D.

The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (Part A) and which compound exhibits optical isomerism (Part B). Here's the analysis:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups with a hydrogen atom that can shift between them. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound can exist as 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) or 1,4-benzoquinone (para). If it is 1,4-benzoquinone, the ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring and are not adjacent. Therefore, tautomerism is not possible for 1,4-benzoquinone.
   
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 on a six-membered ring. These ketones are not adjacent to each other, so tautomerism is not possible.

Thus, both compounds do not show tautomerism. However, the question specifies that only one compound does not show tautomerism. Based on the analysis, **benzoquinone (assuming it is 1,4-benzoquinone)** is the correct answer for Part A.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups) or a lack of internal symmetry (e.g., meso compounds).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (-OH),
   - A methyl group (-CH₃),
   - A carbonyl group (-COOCH₃),
   - And another methyl group (-CH₃).  
   Since the second carbon has two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (COOCH₃)₂CH=CH. This compound is a trans-diestereomer, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. As a result, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Neither compound exhibits optical isomerism. However, the question specifies that only one compound does. Based on the analysis, **dimethyl fumarate** is the correct answer for Part B.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: Dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

However, the question requires selecting an option where:
- A is the compound that does not show tautomerism.
- B is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **D**:  
**A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.**

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Oh wait, but the main question is about two different properties: tautomerism and optical isomerism. Right, I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds, leading to different structural isomers. And optical isomerism has to do with chiral centers, right? Molecules that are not superimposable on their mirror images, so they can rotate plane-polarized light.

The question is divided into two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think tautomerism requires the presence of adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can shift. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, right? Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketones. Wait, no, benzoquinone is more like a di- or tri-ketone? I think benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic structure with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, making a 1,4-diketone perhaps? Or maybe 1,2? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups in a symmetrical arrangement. So all three are on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring. Wait, 1,3,5-trione would have ketones on carbons 1, 3, and 5, which are all alternate positions—so they're not adjacent. So each is separated by one carbon. So in that case, the structure would have three non-adjacent ketone groups, but each is across from each other.

Tautomerism, like in diketones, happens when you have adjacent carbonyl groups. Because that allows for the movement of a hydrogen between adjacent atoms, leading to a keto-enol tautomer. So if a compound has two adjacent ketone groups, like 1,2-diketone, then tautomerism is possible. For example, benzil is 1,2-diketone and can tautomerize.

Benzoquinone, if it's a 1,4-diketone, then the two ketone groups are not adjacent. Wait, 1,4 on a benzene ring would be across from each other. So the rings would be at positions 1 and 4, which are opposite. So maybe that's not adjacent. So if benzoquinone has ketones in positions that are not adjacent, then it can't tautomerize. Alternatively, if they are adjacent, then it can.

Wait, I might be confusing benzoquinone. Let me think again. Benzoquinone can be 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. Oh right, so there are two forms. The 1,2 has adjacent ketone groups, so that can tautomerize. But 1,4 would have the ketones opposite each other, so they can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent H to shift.

Wait, but the question is about whether the compound shows tautomerism. So if benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't undergo tautomerism. But I'm not sure if benzoquinone is 1,2 or 1,4. Wait, I recall that in organic chemistry, quinones are often 1,4-diketones. For example, para-benzoquinone is 1,4, which can't tautomerize because the ketones are not adjacent. Whereas 1,2 would allow keto-enol tautomerism.

So wait, the two options for A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Which one doesn't show tautomerism. If benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't tautomerize. What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the three ketone groups are at positions 1,3,5. So each is separated by a CH2 group. So each is adjacent in the ring to a CH2, but not directly next to another ketone. So in this case, any two ketones are two carbons apart. So can they undergo tautomerism? I think tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups with a hydrogen in between. So perhaps in this case, each ketone is separated by a CH2, so no adjacent H to shift. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism either?

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe if there are three ketones in a row, like 1,2,3-trione, then they can tautomerize. But 1,3,5 are every other position, so that's not adjacent. So in that case, neither benzoquinone (1,4) nor cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have adjacent ketones, so neither can tautomerize. But the question is about which one does not show tautomerism. Wait, but the question is that one of them doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: tautomerism occurs when there's a possibility for hydrogen shift between adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, in 1,2-diketones, like diketones, tautomerism is possible. But if the two carbonyls are not adjacent, then it's not possible.

So, for benzoquinone, if it's 1,4, then the two ketones are opposite each other on the benzene ring; they are not adjacent. So tautomerism is not possible. So benzoquinone cannot tautomerize. What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? It has three ketones, each separated by a CH2. So no two are adjacent. So tautomerism is not possible. Hmm, but the question states that among these two, the one that does NOT show tautomerism is A. So either both don't show it, which can't be, because the options suggest one or the other.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the structures again.

Benzoquinone, 1,4- would have two ketone groups across from each other on the benzene ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=C=O, with the two ketones at opposite ends.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones in a six-membered ring, each at 1,3,5 positions. So the structure is a ring with O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO- or something like that. Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. 1,3,5-trione would have ketones on carbons 1, 3, and 5. Each of these is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So each ketone is flanked by CH2 groups.

In such a structure, could a hydrogen shift occur between any two carbonyl groups? Let's imagine carbon 1 is a ketone (C=O), carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is another ketone, and so on. So the carbonyls are at every other carbon. So they are not adjacent. So no adjacent hydrogens to shift. Therefore, neither compound can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question says that one of them does not show tautomerism. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that benzoquinone doesn't show it. Maybe benzoquinone is a 1,2-diketone, allowing tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize but the trione can.

Wait, maybe I should look up the structure of benzoquinone. Oh wait, in reality, benzoquinone can exist as 1,2 and 1,4 isomers. The 1,2 isomer is also called para-benzoquinone, but actually, no, 1,2 is ortho, and 1,4 is para. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. In benzene ring numbering, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 1 and 4 are across.

So 1,2-benzoquinone has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons—so it can undergo tautomerism. But 1,4 cannot. So if the question refers to benzoquinone without specifying, perhaps it's referring to 1,4, which can't. But it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that benzoquinone is a 1,4-diketone, so it cannot undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't either. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about part B and come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism happens when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different groups attached to a carbon. Alternatively, meso compounds can't show optical isomerism because they have a plane of symmetry.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-COOH? Or wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Its ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. So the carbonyl is in the middle. So, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-something? Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- CH3 (from the CH2)
- and another CH2.

Wait, no, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-O
   |   |
   OH  CH3

Wait, perhaps better to draw it as:

The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when you make the methyl ester, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3

The central carbon is the second carbon (CH2), but wait, that's a CH2 group, so each carbon is CH2, so no chiral centers. Wait, wait. Wait, the second carbon is connected to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group? Or is the structure different?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2 with OH, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group attached? Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2, so each attached group is:

- OH
- COOCH3
- CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me number the carbons. The propanoate ester would have three carbons: COOCH3 is the first, then a CH2, then another CH2 with OH.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the backbone is:

COOCH3 — CH2 — CH2OH

So the middle carbon is the CH2 between COOCH3 and CH2OH. So that central carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3 group (on one side)
- two CH2 groups (one from the COOCH3, another to the OH)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the central carbon is actually the middle of the three carbons. Wait, no, no. Wait, the molecule is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH

So the central carbon is the middle CH2. So its four groups are:

- COOCH3 (from the left)
- CH2OH (from the right)
- two H's.

Wait, no, wait, each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon is CH2, so attached to:

- COOCH3 group,
- CH2OH group,
- two H's.

So that's only three different groups, and two H's. Therefore, it's not a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH, then the ester group is on the first carbon, and the second carbon has two CH2 groups. So the second carbon is CH2, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the first CH2 after the COOCH3. So that carbon is CH2, so it's attached to COOCH3, another CH2 (which then leads to OH), and two H's. Again, that's not a chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, what about dimethyl fumarate? Fumaric acid is a diacid, and its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumaric acid is a diene with two carboxylic acid groups on each end.

Structure of fumaric acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is a trans-dienoic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, where each COOH is esterified with methanol, leading to:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not right. No, wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, perhaps better to write as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So dimethyl fumarate has the structure:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)

But wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

No, that's not the case. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the double bond is between the two CH groups. So when esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3.

So the structure becomes CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, I'm getting this wrong again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the two COOH groups are at the ends of a double bond. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait, that's succinic acid. No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is a diacid with a double bond between the two central carbons.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each -COOH is converted to -COOCH3. So the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no, the double bond is present. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But that can't be right because the double bond was in the acid. So the ester would have the same double bond. So it's:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no. So it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But the double bond is between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is actually a trans-diepoxy structure. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. The structure of fumarate is:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me look it up in my mind. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester dimethyl fumarate would have:

COOCH3 groups on each end, connected by a double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's succinate. Fumarate would have a double bond, so it's:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. No, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So each end is COOCH3, connected by a double bond.

Wait, no, the actual structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's without a double bond. No, wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). No, actually, fumarate is a trans-diepoxy, so the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Fumarate is a diepoxy compound with a double bond. So dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on either side of a double bond. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain? Hmm.

Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH

So when you esterify both COOH groups with methanol, you get:

CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, that would be a three-carbon structure? Hmm, no, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct either. I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the symmetry.

Now, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond between the two CH groups, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is (COOCH3)₂CH=CH.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, it's (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). So the two COOCH3 groups are on either end of the double bond, but on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps that's the structure. So the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, making it a trans configuration, or opposite?

Wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So when you esterify them, the two COOCH3 groups would be on opposite sides as well.

So the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this structure have a plane of symmetry? Let me see.

If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no, because each has a COOCH3 group, but if they are on opposite sides, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Or perhaps it's not, leading to the possibility of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomerism. So, for example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, then it won't have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has two COOCH3 groups attached to each end of the double bond. If the substituents on each side are the same, and if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and won't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric. So in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (COOCH3)₂, with each COOCH3 attached to a CH on each side of the double bond.

Wait, so if the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond, it's:

COOCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, in that case, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me see. If you imagine a vertical plane through the double bond, the substituents on either side (both COOCH3) are mirror images, so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's a meso compound and doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are in a trans configuration, then the molecule is actually symmetrical. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: if a compound has two identical groups on either side of a double bond, and the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two COOH groups on each end, making it symmetrical.

So in dimethyl fumarate, if the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, would that create a chiral center? No, because each carbon is attached to two identical groups. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, in the structure (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Alternatively, let's imagine the structure. Each of the two central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each CH has a COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in that case, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and two CH groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

In that case, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3, two CH₂ groups, and a hydrogen? No, wait, each of those carbons would have a COOCH3, two CH₂ groups, and a double bond. I think I'm getting too confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. No, that's not right. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the diester, so each COOH becomes COOCH3.

So, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So each of the two middle carbons (in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH group. Each of those CH groups is attached to another COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) has the following groups:

- COOCH3
- another COOCH3 from the other end
- two CH groups.

Wait, no, I'm mixing up the structure. Let me try to imagine it as:

But with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is:

O

O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH₂

O

O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that's not possible because CH₂=CH₂ is ethene. So dimethyl fumarate would be O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3 with a double bond, making it O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

In this case, each of the middle carbons (the CH in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3, a CH group, and two H's. Wait, but in that case, each of these carbons would have two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH), so they're not chiral centers. But wait, if each of those carbons is attached to two different groups, perhaps they are chiral centers.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- another CH (from the double bond)
- two H's.

So each has two H's, a COOCH3, and a CH. So they’re attached to two identical groups (the H's and the CH), so no, they’re not chiral centers.

Wait, but if the double bond is between two carbons each attached to a COOCH3 group, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound. Wait, what's the structure again. If the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, then the molecule would not be symmetrical. Or if they're on opposite sides, it would be symmetrical.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the structure symmetrical. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that would mean that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism either. But that can't be right because I thought fumarate could form enantiomers.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about this differently. If a molecule has a double bond with identical substituents on each end, and it's trans, then it's symmetrical. So in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3), and the molecule is trans, making it symmetrical. That would mean it's a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

But I'm getting confused. Another approach: let's think about the possibility of enantiomers. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and won't have enantiomers. If not, it can have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a symmetrical structure. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: maybe dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a meso compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetrical.

Wait, let me think of another way. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. So each half mirrors the other, so it's a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, then, which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism?

Earlier, I thought methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being a meso compound, also doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's a problem because the question is asking which one does show optical isomerism. So I must have made a mistake.

Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake with the structures.

Wait, another approach: let's think about whether the compounds have any chiral centers.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (the second CH2) is attached to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3. So, the groups are: two CH2 (same), OH, COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (the two CH2), so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

In dimethyl fumarate: if the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, each of the two middle carbons (connected by the double bond) are attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, but each of these is connected to two CH groups. No, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and two CH groups. Wait, no, each of the double-bond carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- another CH (from the double bond)
- two H's.

So each is attached to two H's, which are identical. So each of these carbons only has three different groups: COOCH3, H, and the other CH. Wait, but that would mean each has three groups, but wait, the double bond restricts rotation, so perhaps each carbon has four substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and the adjacent CH group. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other atoms (the adjacent carbons), so in reality, each has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and the double bond. So no, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps neither compound has a chiral center, but that can't be because the question asks which one does. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound. Let me think about it again. If the substituents on each end are the same, and the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound. But if not, it's not.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, and the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound. So dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then neither of the two compounds in part B exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the question is asking which one does.

I must have made a mistake in analyzing the structures.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual compounds. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl glycolate. Glycolic acid is HOCH2COOH, so the ester would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, each of the carbons in the chain:

- The first carbon is CH2OH.

- The second carbon is CH2 connected to the first and the third.

- The third carbon is COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (the second one) is CH2, attached to two CH2 groups, one OH, and one COOCH3. Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- two H's.

Wait, so the groups are:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So four substituents: two H's, CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. Are any of these identical? The two H's are identical, but the other two groups are different. So the second carbon has two H's and two different groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the H's). So no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about another possibility. Maybe the structure is such that the middle carbon has four different groups. For example, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, no, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me number the carbons again. propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- OH group,
- two CH2 groups,
- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, the middle carbon is attached to:

- The first CH2 (CH2OH)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- two H's.

So, the substituents are:

- CH2OH
- COOCH3
- two H's.

So, the groups are CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. Since two H's are the same, this carbon isn't a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

But then, what about dimethyl fumarate? If it's a meso compound, it won't show optical isomerism. So neither of them do, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another possibility. What if dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound? Let me think.

If the two substituents on the double bond are the same (COOCH3), but the molecule isn't symmetrical, then the molecule could have a chiral center.

Wait, but if the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical, then it's a meso compound. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't.

Wait, but according to my analysis, neither do. So I'm probably wrong. What else could I be missing?

Wait, perhaps in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents. Let me visualize it again. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH2. So attached groups are:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

No, that's three substituents, but it's a CH2 group, so two H's. So no, not a chiral center.

Then, what about dimethyl fumarate? If it's a trans-diesters, could it have a chiral center?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the molecule has two identical groups on each end, making it a meso compound, so no optical isomerism. So the correct answer for part B would be dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't. But the question is which one does show it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Maybe it doesn't have a plane of symmetry, thus allowing for optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually (COOCH3)₂CH=CH. So each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each of these carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- another CH group
- two H's.

So each has three substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and another CH. Wait, but this would imply that each has two identical substituents (the H's), so they're not chiral centers.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to find another approach. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So for part A, the correct answer is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't tautomerize, so A would be benzoquinone. Then, in part B, perhaps dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism, making option D correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so it doesn't. Alternatively, if dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with maleate. Maleate is a cis diacid, and when esterified, its diester can show optical isomerism because it has two identical ester groups on the same side, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, but fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate, being trans, has the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Thus, it's a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, then in part B, neither compound shows optical isomerism, which can't be right because the question is asking which one does.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps it's better to conclude that option D is correct, where A is benzoquinone (which doesn't tautomerize) and B is dimethyl fumarate, which does show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck and proceed to make an educated guess.

So, going back to part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone is 1,4, then it can't. So A would be benzoquinone.

In part B, dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So the answer would be D.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (Part A) and which compound exhibits optical isomerism (Part B). Here's the analysis:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups with a hydrogen atom that can shift between them. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound can exist as 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) or 1,4-benzoquinone (para). If it is 1,4-benzoquinone, the ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring and are not adjacent. Therefore, tautomerism is not possible for 1,4-benzoquinone.
   
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 on a six-membered ring. These ketones are not adjacent to each other, so tautomerism is not possible.

Thus, both compounds do not show tautomerism. However, the question specifies that only one compound does not show tautomerism. Based on the analysis, **benzoquinone (assuming it is 1,4-benzoquinone)** is the correct answer for Part A.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups) or a lack of internal symmetry (e.g., meso compounds).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (-OH),
   - A methyl group (-CH₃),
   - A carbonyl group (-COOCH₃),
   - And another methyl group (-CH₃).  
   Since the second carbon has two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (COOCH₃)₂CH=CH. This compound is a trans-diestereomer, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. As a result, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Neither compound exhibits optical isomerism. However, the question specifies that only one compound does. Based on the analysis, **dimethyl fumarate** is the correct answer for Part B.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: Dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

However, the question requires selecting an option where:
- A is the compound that does not show tautomerism.
- B is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **D**:  
**A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.**

Answer: D
