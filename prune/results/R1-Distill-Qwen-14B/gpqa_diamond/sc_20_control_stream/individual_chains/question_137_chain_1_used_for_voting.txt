Okay, so I've got this question about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on my accelerator physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations and reaches a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U₀ cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀], where Φ₀ is π/4 and U₀ is 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm. I remember that in cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key here is probably figuring out the time it takes to reach that kinetic energy and then how many times it revolves in that time.

Wait, wait. Synchrocyclotrons are different from regular cyclotrons because the magnetic field isn't constant. Oh right, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time. That's to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating electric field as they gain energy and their orbit radius increases. So the frequency of the electric field must adjust as the particle's mass increases with velocity.

But how does that tie into the number of revolutions? Well, each revolution corresponds to a certain amount of energy gained, perhaps. But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the energy gain.

The voltage U(t) is the electric potential that does work on the proton. Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy. But wait, the voltage is time-dependent, so the acceleration happens when the electric field is in the right direction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the resonance condition. In a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the natural frequency of the particle's motion in the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field increases, the frequency also changes. However, the frequency of the accelerating voltage ν(α) probably adjusts to match the particle's changing frequency.

Wait, the problem says that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe each acceleration corresponds to a particular step in the process. But I'm not entirely sure about that part.

Let me think about the energy. The kinetic energy gained is related to the work done by the electric field. The work done per revolution would be the energy gained each time the particle goes through the potential difference. But wait, in a cyclotron, the particles go through the electric field twice per revolution (since the field alternates direction each half-period). So each full cycle (two half-cycles) provides a certain energy gain.

But wait, the voltage is U(t) = U₀ cos(...). So the maximum potential difference is U₀. But I'm not sure how that translates into energy gain per revolution.

Wait, the potential difference across the gap in the cyclotron is U(t). The particle goes through this potential difference twice per revolution, right? So each time it goes through the gap, it either gains or loses energy based on the sign of the potential. But since the voltage is sinusoidal, the particle will gain energy when the voltage is in the right phase.

Wait, but in the case of a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated every time they cross the gap when the electric field is in the same direction as their motion. So each time they go through the gap (either end of the Dees), they gain some energy. But the number of times they go through the gap would depend on the frequency of the applied voltage and the time they spend in the machine.

But wait, the question is about the number of revolutions. Each revolution is a full orbit around the magnetic field. So the number of revolutions is the number of times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before exiting.

Hmm. So perhaps I need to find the time it takes to reach 950 MeV, and then determine how many orbits that corresponds to. But how?

Wait, the kinetic energy is given as T = 950 MeV. The proton starts with negligible energy, so T ≈ K = (1/2) m v². But wait, for non-relativistic speeds, K = (1/2)mv², but for relativistic speeds, it's K = (γ-1)mc². So I need to check if at 950 MeV, the proton is relativistic.

The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So 950 MeV is a bit above that, which means it's a highly relativistic particle. So I should use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy.

So K = (γ - 1) mc² = 950 MeV.

Given that mc² is 938 MeV, so γ - 1 = 950 / 938 ≈ 1.01278. So γ ≈ 2.01278.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if K = (γ-1) mc², and K=950, then (γ-1) = 950 / 938 ≈ 1.01278. So γ ≈ 2.01278.

But what's the relation between γ and the velocity or the magnetic field in the synchrocyclotron? Hmm.

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is varied with time to keep the resonance condition. The resonance condition is that the frequency of the applied electric field ν matches the cyclotron frequency of the particle as it gains energy. The cyclotron frequency is given by ω = (qB)/(γ m). So as B increases, ω increases, and ν must track that.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. Maybe I should think about how much energy is gained per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps each revolution provides a certain amount of energy gain. Wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the voltage multiplied by the charge, but since it's sinusoidal, maybe each full cycle contributes a certain amount.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t) = U₀ cos(2π ν t + Φ₀), so the time-averaged voltage isn't zero. The phase Φ₀ is π/4, so maybe that shifts the voltage, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is (e U₀ / 2 ), since the voltage goes from peak to peak every period, and the particle goes through two gaps (each gap contributing e U) per revolution. Wait, but not exactly. Let me think.

In a cyclotron, the electric field alternates direction every half-period. So each time the particle goes through a gap, the electric field is in the direction to accelerate it. So for each full cycle (period T), the particle gains energy twice. So each revolution (half a period?) contributes an energy gain.

Wait, perhaps each half-period corresponds to a revolution. Maybe each time the proton completes a half-orbit, it gains some energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled up here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total energy gained as being the number of times the particle is accelerated multiplied by the energy per acceleration.

Wait, the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Two accelerations? So perhaps each acceleration corresponds to a certain energy gain.

Wait, the question says "undergoes two accelerations". Maybe that's a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Because in a cyclotron, the particle is accelerated every time it goes through the gaps, which happens twice per revolution. So in one revolution, the proton is accelerated twice.

Wait, the question says two accelerations. So if the proton makes N revolutions, it would be accelerated 2N times. And each acceleration gives a certain energy gain. So the total energy would be 2N * (e U₀ / 2 ), because each acceleration gives e U₀/2 on average?

Wait, no, the potential difference is U(t), which varies with time. The actual energy per acceleration isn't a fixed amount because the voltage is time-dependent. But if U(t) is varying sinusoidally, perhaps the average energy per acceleration is something else.

Wait, but in the problem, U(t) is given as U0 cos(...), which is a sinusoidal voltage. So perhaps the maximum voltage is U0. But when the proton passes through the gap, the voltage it experiences varies. So the actual energy gain per passage might be e U(t) at the time of passage.

But that complicates things because U(t) is varying. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, the energy gain per revolution is approximately e U0. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total energy and how many times the proton is accelerated. The proton's kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Each acceleration contributes e U0. But wait, in a cyclotron, each half-cycle (passing through one gap) gives an energy gain of e U0. Because the voltage is maximum when the particle is at the gap.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the particle is accelerated each time it goes through a gap, and each time it gains e U0. Because the voltage is maximum when the particle arrives, so the maximum energy is added each time.

Wait, but that would be if the voltage is always at maximum when the particle arrives. But in reality, the voltage is sinusoidal, so sometimes the particle arrives when the voltage is negative, which would decelerate it, but in a cyclotron, I think the phase is chosen so that the particle is accelerated each time it goes through the gap.

Wait, the initial phase is Φ₀ = π/4. So the voltage starts at U0 cos(π/4) ≈ 0.707 U0. Hmm. But I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is determined by the time it takes to reach 950 MeV, and the time per revolution.

Wait, but how to find the time.

Wait, the kinetic energy is 950 MeV, which is about 1.01278 times the rest mass energy, so γ is about 2.01278. So the total energy E = γ m c² ≈ 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time such that the cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage. The cyclotron frequency is ω = (e B)/(γ m). So as B increases, ω increases, so the frequency of the voltage must also increase.

But how does that help me find the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, perhaps the time to reach the desired energy is the time it takes for the particle to make a certain number of orbits. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy per orbit. Each orbit, the particle gains some energy, say ΔE. The total number of orbits N would be approximately the total energy divided by ΔE.

But what is ΔE per orbit?

Wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the energy gained per orbit is roughly e U0. Because each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains e U0. But wait, each orbit has two gaps. So each orbit would give e U0 * 2, perhaps?

Wait, no, because each time the particle goes through a gap, it gains e U0. So for each orbit (which includes two gaps), it gains 2 e U0. But wait, that might not be correct because the actual gain depends on the phase of the voltage when the particle is in the gap.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the average energy gained per revolution. If the voltage is sinusoidal, but the phase is set so that the particle is always accelerated (Φ₀ is set so that the voltage peaks when the particle is in the gap), then each passage through a gap would give maximum energy gain.

But in this case, the phase is π/4. So perhaps the maximum isn't achieved on the first pass, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is N * e U0, where N is the number of times the particle is accelerated. So each time, it gains e U0. So N = T / (e U0).

But wait, T is 950 MeV. Let's compute that.

Wait, e U0 is the charge times the voltage. The charge of a proton is e = 1.6e-19 C. U0 is 190 kV = 190,000 V.

So e U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190,000 V = 1.6e-19 * 1.9e5 = approx 3.04e-14 J.

Convert that to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. So 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approx 1.9e5 eV = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

So each acceleration gives the proton 190 keV of energy.

The total kinetic energy needed is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

So the number of accelerations N_acc is 950,000 keV / 190 keV per acceleration = approx 5000 accelerations.

But wait, the question is about the number of revolutions, not accelerations. Each revolution involves two accelerations (since the particle goes through two gaps per revolution). So the number of revolutions N_rev is N_acc / 2 = 5000 / 2 = 2500.

But looking at the options, option D is 2500. So would that be the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. I'm assuming each acceleration gives 190 keV, but in reality, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...). So the actual energy gained each time is e U(t), which varies. So perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is adjusted in phase so that the particle is accelerated each time it passes through a gap. So the effective energy gain per gap traversal is e U0, as the voltage is maximum when the particle is at the gap.

Wait, but in reality, the phase might not be perfectly matched, but in this problem, Φ₀ is given as π/4. So maybe the initial phase affects the effective energy gain.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective voltage is U_eff = U0 cos(Φ₀). Because when the particle arrives at the gap, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(Φ₀). So the effective energy per acceleration is e U0 cos(Φ₀).

Wait, in that case, each acceleration would give e U0 cos(Φ₀). So the total number of accelerations needed would be T / (e U0 cos Φ₀).

Given that Φ₀ is π/4, cos(π/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

So e U0 cos(Φ₀) = 190 keV * 0.7071 ≈ 134.35 keV per acceleration.

So the number of accelerations N_acc = 950,000 keV / 134.35 keV ≈ 7071. So N_rev = 7071 / 2 ≈ 3535.5. Which is approximately 3536, which is option C.

Hmm, that's conflicting with my first calculation. So which one is correct?

I think the key is whether the effective voltage is U0 or U0 cos(Φ₀). Because the voltage at the time the particle arrives at the gap depends on the phase. So if the phase is π/4, when the particle arrives, the voltage is U0 cos(π/4), so that's about 0.707 U0.

Therefore, each acceleration gives e * (U0 cos Φ₀) of energy.

So total accelerations N_acc = T / (e U0 cos Φ₀) = 950e3 keV / (190e3 keV * cos(π/4)).

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that.

First, compute cos(π/4) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071.

So 190e3 keV * 0.7071 ≈ 134.35e3 keV per acceleration.

So N_acc = 950e3 / 134.35e3 ≈ 7.071.

Wait, wait, 950,000 divided by 134,350 is approximately 7.071. Wait, that can't be right because 7 accelerations would give 940.45 keV, which is way below 950 MeV.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I messed up the units. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the total kinetic energy T is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

Each acceleration gives e U(t) at the moment. But if the phase is such that each acceleration gives e U0 cos(Φ₀), which is 190e3 V * e * cos(Φ₀). Wait, no, wait. Wait, U(t) is in volts. e is 1.6e-19 C. So e * U(t) = e * U0 cos(...), which gives energy in joules, which we convert to eV.

But perhaps I should compute it in terms of eV.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of MeV.

Wait, let me try this approach:

Each acceleration gives an energy gain of e * U0 * cos(Φ₀) in eV.

Wait, but U0 is 190 kV, so e * U0 = 190 keV. So each acceleration gives e * U0 * cos(Φ₀) = 190 keV * cos(π/4) ≈ 134.35 keV.

So the number of accelerations N_acc = total energy needed / energy per acceleration.

Total energy: 950,000 keV.

So N_acc = 950,000 / 134.35 ≈ 7071.02 accelerations.

Each revolution provides two accelerations, so number of revolutions N = 7071.02 / 2 ≈ 3535.5, which rounds to 3536.

Looking at the options, option C is 3536. So that would be the answer.

But wait, earlier when I didn't account for the phase, I got 2500. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, because the phase affects the effective gain per acceleration. Because the particle arrives at the gap when the voltage is at a phase of π/4, which means the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) ≈ 0.707 U0 at that moment. So each acceleration doesn't give the full U0, but 0.707 U0. So the number of accelerations needed is higher, leading to more revolutions.

So the correct number of revolutions would be approximately 3536, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between the applied voltage and the proton's motion. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and reaches a kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied is given as \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relating Energy Gain to Voltage**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy proportional to the voltage at that moment. The energy gained per acceleration is approximately \(e U(t)\), where \(U(t)\) is the voltage at the time of passage. Since \(U(t)\) is sinusoidal, the effective voltage at the gap depends on the phase \(\Phi_0\). For \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\), the effective voltage is \(U_{\text{eff}} = U_0 \cos(\Phi_0) = 190 \, \text{kV} \cdot \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) \approx 134.35 \, \text{kV}\).

2. **Energy Gain Per Acceleration**:  
   The energy gained per acceleration is \(e U_{\text{eff}} \approx 134.35 \, \text{kV}\). Converting this to joules and back to eV confirms that each acceleration provides approximately \(134.35 \, \text{kV}\) of energy.

3. **Total Number of Accelerations**:  
   The total kinetic energy required is \(950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{kV}\). The number of accelerations needed is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{acc}} = \frac{\text{Total Energy}}{\text{Energy per Acceleration}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{kV}}{134.35 \, \text{kV}} \approx 7071
   \]

4. **Number of Revolutions**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, each revolution corresponds to two accelerations (one at each gap). Thus, the number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{rev}} = \frac{N_{\text{acc}}}{2} = \frac{7071}{2} \approx 3536
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes approximately **3536 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron. This corresponds to option **C**.
