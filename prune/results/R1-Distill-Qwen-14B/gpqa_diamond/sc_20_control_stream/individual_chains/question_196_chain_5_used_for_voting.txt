Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember harmonic oscillators from my classical mechanics class, but this is relativistic, so things must be different. Let me try to think this through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a mass m in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with maximum amplitude A. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is found when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)m v_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA² / m). That's option C, but I know that this is the non-relativistic case. Since the question is relativistic, I can't use that directly.

Wait, but in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic energy; there's also rest mass energy. So the total energy would include that. The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. Or wait, actually, in relativity, the energy expressions are different. The relativistic energy for a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But when it's moving, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy.

But wait, this is a harmonic oscillator, so maybe the total energy is quantized? Oh wait, no, maybe it's treated classically because the question doesn't specify quantization. So I can proceed with a classical relativistic approach.

In a classical relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is given by the relativistic formula: (γ - 1) m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the total energy is γ m c², which should equal the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But wait, in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x² and the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but relativistically, p is not mv. Hmm, maybe I should model this.

Wait, let's think about energy conservation in the relativistic case. At maximum amplitude (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)k A². But wait, no: in relativistic cases, the energy isn't just the sum of potential and non-relativistic kinetic. The total energy E is more accurately handled via E = γ m c², which must equal the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy in the relativistic sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the energy equation. The total mechanical energy (which is conserved) is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. So, E = K + U.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c², and the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So the maximum potential energy is when x = A, so U_max = (1/2)k A². At that point, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero (since K = (γ-1) m c², but when v=0, γ=1, so K=0). So the total energy E is U_max = (1/2)k A².

But wait, that can't be right because in relativity, the rest mass energy is m c². So the total energy E should be greater than or equal to m c². But (1/2)k A² could be less than m c², which would cause a problem. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. So E = (1/2) k A² + (γ - 1) m c². But at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (γ') m c², where γ' is the gamma factor at maximum speed. Wait, but earlier, E is (1/2)k A² in the potential case. So setting those equal:

At x=A: E = (1/2)k A² = (γ_rest) m c². But wait, when v=0, γ_rest is 1, so E = m c². But (1/2)k A² must equal E, so (1/2)k A² = m c². Hmm, but that's a specific condition. So if k A² = 2 m c², then the potential energy at maximum displacement equals the rest energy. But that's not necessarily the case here. The problem doesn't state any specific condition on k and A, except that the oscillator is relativistic.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's model the energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, no. The rest mass energy is part of the total energy. So when the oscillator is at rest (x=A, v=0), the total energy is the rest energy plus the potential energy. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A². At x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So then, at x=0, the kinetic energy is E = γ m c². So we have:

γ m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, because (1/2)k A² is the potential energy. So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2 / c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me call the right-hand side as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) +1 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = let's say, factor of D: D = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = D.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1/D.

Square both sides:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1/(D^2).

So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(D^2) = [D^2 - 1]/D^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( (D^2 - 1)/D^2 ) = c sqrt(1 - 1/D^2).

But D is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is [ (2 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c²) ) = let me write D = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

Wait, D = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

So, D^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ] / ( (2 m c²)^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ (D^2 - 1) / D^2 ]

= c² [ ( ( (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2 ) - 1 ) / ( (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2 ) )

Hmm, simplifying that might be a bit complicated. Let me compute D^2 -1.

D^2 -1 = [ (2 m c² +k A²)^2 - (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c²)^2 )

= [ (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² +k² A^4 ) - 4 m² c^4 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

= [ 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck in the algebra. Let me think again. Maybe I can find an expression for v_max in terms of D.

Wait, from earlier:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

Wait, because D = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), so 1/D² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ] )

Let me write it as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(D)^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( (D^2 - 1)/D^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( (D^2 -1)/D^2 ) = c * sqrt( (D^2 -1) ) / D.

But I'm not sure if this leads me to any of the options.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ), but that looks different.

Wait, let me look at each option again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))² )

Wait, that denominator looks like (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)), but in our case, we have (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)), so that's different.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Hmm, that denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)), which is the inverse of our D, which is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about the expression for D:

D = 1 + [k A²/(2 m c²)].

So, 1/D = 1 / ( 1 + [k A²/(2 m c²)] ).

Then, 1/(D²) = [1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c^2))]^2.

So, the expression for v_max is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))]^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, which one matches this.

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + x)]^2, where x = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1 - [1/(1+x)]² = [ (1+x)^2 -1 ] / (1+x)^2

= [1 + 2x + x² -1 ] / (1 + x)^2

= (2x + x²)/(1 +x)^2.

Wait, but that's not particularly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be rewritten.

Wait, perhaps I can express v_max in terms of D.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the reciprocal. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² - 1 ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ] )

The numerator simplifies as (1 + 2 (k A²)/(2 m c²) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) -1 )

= 2 (k A²)/(2 m c²) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2

= (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

But I'm not sure that's useful. Maybe I should look for an option that has this expression.

Looking at option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Ah, wait, that's exactly what I have here.

So option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which matches what I derived.

Wait, but let me compute the expression I have.

Wait, my expression is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))]^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options again.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

That denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is the inverse of what we have. So it's not matching.

Option D seems to match.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I should express v_max in terms of the velocity.

Wait, from the expression v_max = c * sqrt( (D^2 -1) / D^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( ( ( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 - 1 ) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ) -1 = [ (k A²)/(m c^2) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) ]

So, numerator is (k A²)/(m c^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

Denominator is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 = 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

So, when we take the ratio, it's (k A²/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4)) / [1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ]

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to stick with the earlier conclusion.

So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is conserved and includes the rest mass energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy. At maximum amplitude (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic. Thus, the total energy \( E \) is:  
   \[
   E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), the total energy is purely kinetic:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2 / c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   By equating the two expressions for \( E \), we get:  
   \[
   \gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( m c^2 \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]  

3. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2 / c^2}} \), we substitute \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2 / c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}}
   \]  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]  

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**.  

Answer: D
