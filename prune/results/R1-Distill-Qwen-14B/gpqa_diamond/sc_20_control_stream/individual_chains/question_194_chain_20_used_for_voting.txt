Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Since beta is 1/(kT), and each state contributes its Boltzmann factor.

First, I should probably figure out all the possible states for the three spins. Each spin has two possibilities, +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. I'll list them all.

Let me think: each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. So the states are:
1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now I need to calculate the energy E for each state. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. Let's compute each term.

Wait, each term S_i S_j can be either (1)(1)=1, (1)(-1)=-1, etc. So for each pair, the product is ±1.

Let me compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

Starting with state 1: all +1.
S1S2 = 1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1.
Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: 1-1-1 = -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that again. Each product:
S1S2 = (1)(1)=1
S1S3=(1)(-1)=-1
S2S3=(1)(-1)=-1
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no: E = -J * sum. So sum is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1
S1S3 = (1)(1)=1
S2S3 = (-1)(1) = -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

State4: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= (+1)
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1. E = J.

State5: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2= (-1)(1) = -1
S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1
S2S3= (1)(1)= 1
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1. E= J.

State6: (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1
S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1
S2S3= (1)(-1)= -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State7: (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1
S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1
S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1
Sum:1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State8: (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. E= -3J.

Wait, that's interesting. So the states either have E=-3J or E=J.

Looking at all the states:

States 1 and 8 have E=-3J.

All other states (2-7) have E=J.

So how many states have E=-3J? Only two: state1 and state8.

And the remaining 6 states have E=J.

Thus, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E).

Each state contributes exp(-beta E). So for the two states with E=-3J, each contributes exp(-beta*(-3J))= exp(3J beta).

Wait, wait, beta is 1/(kT), and the energy is E. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E).

So for E = -3J, exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 J beta).

For E = J, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta * J) = exp(-J beta).

So the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3 J beta) + 6 * exp(-J beta).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because 2 is multiplied with e^{-3Jβ}, but our term is e^{3J beta}.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that matches.

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ}+6e^{-2Jβ} → No, exponents are 2J beta.

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ}+2e^{-2Jβ} → No.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by calculating the energy \( E \) for all possible states. The energy is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, as each spin can independently be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). By evaluating \( E \) for each state, we find:

1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

From this, two states have \( E = -3J \), and the remaining six states have \( E = J \).

The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta(-3J)} = e^{3J\beta} \). For the six states with \( E = J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta J} \). Thus:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are \( 2J\beta \) instead of \( 3J\beta \) and \( J\beta \).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are \( 2J\beta \) instead of \( 3J\beta \) and \( J\beta \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
