Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's take it step by step. So, the question is about binary star systems and determining which one is more massive. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their radial velocities can tell us something about their masses.

So, the problem states there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and the periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations in system_1 have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are A to D, with some decimal values.

Wait, I think the key here is understanding how the radial velocities relate to the masses of the stars. Oh right! In a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so it moves slower. But wait, the radial velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. Because the more massive star doesn't move as much, right?

So, the formula I've heard about is that the velocity amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_secondary / (M_primary + M_secondary)) multiplied by some orbital parameters. Oh wait, more accurately, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is given by K1 = (v1) and K2 = (v2), where v is the velocity. And from Kepler's laws, the mass function relates K, the period, and the masses.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mass ratio. The ratio of the masses is equal to the inverse ratio of the velocity amplitudes. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So, if star A has mass M_A and velocity K_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity K_B, then M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A.

Wait, let me think again. The center of mass requires that M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, where a is the semi-major axis. And since velocity is proportional to (2πa)/P, so K_A = (2πa_A)/P, K_B = (2πa_B)/P. So, K_A / K_B = a_A / a_B. But M_A a_A = M_B a_B → K_A / K_B = a_A / a_B = M_B / M_A → K_A * M_A = K_B * M_B → M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A.

So the mass ratio is the inverse ratio of the velocity amplitudes. So for each system, I can find the mass ratio, then the total mass, and compare the two systems.

Let me write that down.

For system 1:

K1a = 10 km/s (primary star's RV amplitude)
K1b = 5 km/s (secondary star's RV amplitude)

So, the mass ratio q1 = M1b / M1a = K1a / K1b = 10/5 = 2.

So M1a = M1b / 2.

Wait no, wait. Because M1a is the mass of the first star, M1b the second. Since the more massive star has a smaller K. So if K1a is larger than K1b, then M1a is smaller than M1b. Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A. So for system 1, M1a / M1b = K1b / K1a = 5 /10 = 0.5 → So M1a = 0.5 * M1b. So the mass ratio is M1a : M1b = 1:2.

So the total mass M1 = M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Alternatively, you could write M1a = (K1b / K1a) * M1b. So for system 1, the masses are in the ratio 1:2.

Similarly, for system 2:

K2a =15 km/s, K2b=10 km/s.

So the mass ratio q2 = M2b / M2a = K2a / K2b =15/10 = 1.5.

So M2a = M2b / 1.5 → M2a = (2/3) M2b.

So, M2a : M2b = 2:3.

Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3) M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But wait, how do we relate the total masses of the systems?

Wait, but the periods are given. So the period comes into play with Kepler's third law, because the total mass of the system affects the orbital period. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, but since a isn't given, perhaps we can relate the masses using the periods and the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion and the system's total mass. The formula is K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_companion) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation that (M1 + M2) * P² = (4π² a³)/(G), where a is the separation. But since we don't have a, maybe we can find the ratio of the masses using the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Wait, the velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_companion) / ( (P * (M1 + M2))^(1/3) ) / c )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the mass function. The mass function for each component is:

f(M) = (M2³ sin³i) / ( (M1 + M2)² )

But I'm not sure about the inclination angle i. However, since both systems are eclipsing binaries, their inclination is likely close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So, the mass function can be determined.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach: The total mass of the system can be found with the formula that relates the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula for the mass function is f(M) = (K³ P) / (2942), where K is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) in solar masses.

But wait, f(M) is only a function of the mass of the companion and the inclination. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume i ≈ 90 degrees, so f(M) equals (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but with sin i ~1.

So for each system, f(M) = (M_companion³ ) / ( (M_total)^2 )

Let's compute f(M) for both systems.

But wait, wait. Each system has two stars, and we have the RV amplitudes for both. Let me think about system_1: Star A has K1a=10 km/s, Star B has K1b=5 km/s.

The mass function for Star A is f(M) = (M2³) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (M_B³) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 ). But how is this connected to the RV amplitude?

Wait, the mass function for Star A is f_A = (M_B³ sin³i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 (1 + M_A / M_B )² )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the mass function for each star is f_A = (M_B³) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 ), assuming i=90 degrees.

Wait, but the mass function is for each component, but I think the correct approach is that when you have both stars' velocities, you can model each as the mass function. So perhaps using the combined information.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model each system's total mass in terms of their RV data and periods.

Let me think for system_1.

In system_1, the two stars have K1a=10 and K1b=5. The period is P1=2 years.

The mass function for each star is:

f_A = (M_B³ sin³i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) = (K_A P )² ( (1 + M_A/M_B )² ) / ( (2π G)² )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for K:

K = [ (G (M_B) ) / ( (M_A + M_B) (1 - e²) ) ]^(1/2) * ( sin i ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/2) * (1/(year)) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the mass ratio and the period.

Wait, since I'm looking for the ratio of the total masses, perhaps I can find M1_total / M2_total.

But how?

Wait, another approach: The more massive a system is, the longer the period for the same separation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the period is related to the total mass via Kepler's third law.

But without knowing the separation, perhaps I can relate the mass of the systems through their RV amplitudes and periods.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_companion) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.

The formula is K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c³) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_companion * sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

Assuming i is 90 degrees, sin i =1.

So, K = [ (G P ) / (2π c³) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_companion) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

But I'm not confident about the exact formula. Let's perhaps express the ratio of the masses.

Wait, for each star, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the mass of that star, given the same period and separation. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, let me think in terms of the relation between the two stars in a binary. The two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity. Therefore, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass.

So, for each system, the ratio of the two velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses.

So, for system_1:

K1a / K1b = (M1b / M1a )

So, 10 /5 =2 → M1b = 2 M1a.

So, the masses are in a 1:2 ratio, M1a : M1b.

The total mass is M1 = M1a + M1b = 3 M1a.

Similarly, for system_2:

K2a =15, K2b=10 → K2a/K2b=3/2 → M2b = (3/2) M2a.

So, the masses are M2a : M2b = 2:3.

Total mass is M2 = 5 M2a.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is the entire story because the period also affects the velocities. How?

Because the period is the orbital period, which depends on the total mass. So the period P is related to the total mass M of the system and the separation a.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G M)

But if the separation a is the same for both systems, then the period would be longer for more massive systems. But I don't know if a is the same for both systems. So that's a problem.

Wait, no, the separation isn't given. So perhaps we can't make that assumption. So, maybe I need another approach.

Wait, but I can relate the velocities and the period. The orbital speed is related to the circumference and the period.

The orbital speed v = 2π a / P.

But a is the semi-major axis, which is the same for both stars in the system, considering the binary orbit. So, for each star, a1 and a2 are such that a1 + a2 = a (the separation).

But the velocity of each star is v1 = 2π a1 / P and v2=2π a2 / P.

From the center of mass condition, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

So the velocities are v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (M2 a)/( (M1+M2) P )

Similarly, v2 = 2π (M1 a) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

But a can be expressed from Kepler's third law:

a³ = (G (M1 + M2) P²) / (4π²)

So, a = [ (G (M1 + M2) P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Substituting into v1:

v1 = [ 2 π (M2 a) ] / [ (M1 + M2) P ]

Substituting a:

v1 = [ 2 π M2 ] / [ (M1 + M2) P ] * [ (G (M1 + M2) P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression. Let me cube the a term:

v1 = [2 π M2 ] / [ (M1 + M2) P ] * [ ( G (M1 + M2) P² ) / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ]

Let me factor out the terms:

Let me write it as:

v1 = (2 π M2) / ( (M1 + M2) P ) * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Take the term inside the cube root:

= [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

v1 = (2 π M2) / [ (M1 + M2) P ] * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me separate the terms:

= (2 π M2) / [ (M1 + M2) P ] * [ G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) ]

Simplify each part:

= (2 π M2) / [ (M1 + M2) P ] * [ G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) ]

Let me multiply the terms:

Numerator: 2 π M2 * G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3)

Denominator: (M1 + M2) P * 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

Breaking down:

= [ 2 * G^(1/3) M2 (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) π ] / [ (M1 + M2) * 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P ]

Simplify the exponents:

(M1 + M2)^(1/3) / (M1 + M2) = (M1 + M2)^(-2/3)

P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3)

π / π^(2/3) = π^(1/3)

So,

= [ 2 G^(1/3) M2 (M1 + M2)^(-2/3) P^(-1/3) π^(1/3) ] / [4^(1/3) ]

Simplify constants:

2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1) / 2^(2/3) )= 2^(1 - 2/3) = 2^(1/3)

So,

v1 = 2^(1/3) G^(1/3) M2 (M1 + M2)^(-2/3) P^(-1/3) π^(1/3 ) 

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to relate K (velocity amplitude) with the masses and the period.

Alternatively, since we have the ratio of the velocities, perhaps we can find the mass ratio and then the total mass for each system. But how?

Wait, earlier, I found that for system_1, the mass ratio is M1a : M1b = 1 : 2. So, the total mass M1 = 3 M1a.

Similarly, for system_2, M2a : M2b = 2:3 → M2 =5 M2a.

But then, how do the periods come into play?

Wait, from Kepler's third law, the period P is related to the total mass M. So, for each system, P² is proportional to (a³)/(M), where a is the separation. But since a isn't given, perhaps we can't directly compare the total masses without more data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses using the periods and velocity amplitudes.

Wait, from the formula for K, the semi-amplitude, which is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_companion ) / ( (M_total) (1-e²) ) ]^(1/2) * ( sin i ) / ( sqrt( (M_total + M_companion) / M_companion ) )

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Perhaps another approach.

Wait, another formula I found online (but I can't cite it, but I remember from studies): the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (1 + M / M_0 )^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, another approach.

Wait, for a binary system, the two stars orbit each other with a separation a. The velocity of each star is v1 = (2 π a1) / P, v2 = (2 π a2)/P. Since a = a1 + a2, and M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

So, v1 = (2 π a1 ) / P = (2 π (M2 a) ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

Similarly, v2 = (2 π (M1 a) ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

Also, from Kepler's third law: a³ = G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² )

So, substitute a into the v expressions.

v1 = (2 π M2 )/( (M1 + M2) P ) * [ ( G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the cube root term:

= [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

= G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

Now, substitute back into v1:

v1 = (2 π M2 )/( (M1 + M2) P ) * [ G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [2 π M2 G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) ] / [ (M1 + M2) P * 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

(M1 + M2) in the denominator is (M1 + M2)^1, so numerator has (M1 + M2)^(1/3) → overall (M1 + M2)^(-2/3)

P in the denominator is P^1, numerator has P^(2/3) → overall P^(-1/3)

For π: numerator is π^1, denominator is π^(2/3) → overall π^(1/3)

So,

v1 = 2 π M2 G^(1/3) / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * 4^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ] * (π^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should factor the constants.

Let me arrange the terms:

v1 = [2 π ] * [ M2 ] * [ G^(1/3) ] / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ] * [ 4^(1/3) ) ]^(-1) * [ P^(1/3) ) ]^(-1) * [ π^(1/3) ]

Hmm, maybe this is getting too messy. Let me try to group the constants.

2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) = 2^(1/3)

π^(1) * π^(1/3) = π^(4/3)

So,

v1 = [ 2^(1/3) * π^(4/3) * M2 * G^(1/3) ] / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ]

Alternatively,

v1 = [ (2 G π^4 )^(1/3) * M2 ] / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ]

But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I can find a ratio between the two systems.

Let me denote for system_1: M1 = M1a + M1b = M1a + 2 M1a = 3 M1a

Similarly, for system_2: M2 = M2a + M2b = M2a + 1.5 M2a = 2.5 M2a

Wait, from earlier reasoning, for system_1, M1b = 2 M1a → M1 = 3 M1a.

For system_2, M2b = 1.5 M2a → M2 = 2.5 M2a.

But how do I relate the periods to the total masses?

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's find the ratio of the total masses using their periods and the velocity amplitudes.

For each system, the velocity amplitude K is given, and the period P is known.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_companion sin i ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( c ) ) * ( P )^(-1/3 )

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the following: For each system, the product of the velocity amplitude and the cube root of the period can be used to find the mass function.

Wait, I found a formula elsewhere: The mass function for a binary system is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2942), where K is in km/s, P in years. And f(M) is in solar masses.

So, f(M) = (K^3 P) / 2942.

But since the systems are eclipsing, sin i is approximately 1. So, the mass function f(M) is given by f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But for system_1, we have two velocity amplitudes: K1a and K1b. So, what can I do with them?

Wait, each star's mass function is based on the other star. So, for star A in system_1, the mass function is f_A = (M_B^3) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) = (K1a^3 P1) / 2942.

Similarly, for star B in system_1, f_B = (M_A^3) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) = (K1b^3 P1) / 2942.

So, for system_1:

f_A = (10^3 * 2) / 2942 ≈ (1000 * 2) /2942 ≈ 2000 /2942 ≈ 0.679 Msun.

f_B = (5^3 * 2 ) / 2942 → (125 *2 ) /2942 → 250 /2942 ≈0.0849 Msun.

But f_A = (M_B^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

Similarly, f_B = (M_A^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

So, from system_1, f_A = (M_B^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) = 0.679.

f_B = (M_A^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) = 0.0849.

Let me take the ratio f_A / f_B = [ (M_B^3)/(M_total²) ] / [ (M_A^3)/(M_total²) ) ] = (M_B^3)/(M_A^3) ) = ( M_B / M_A )^3.

So, ( f_A / f_B ) = ( M_B / M_A )^3 → (0.679 / 0.0849 ) = ( M_B / M_A )^3.

Calculating 0.679 / 0.0849 ≈8.0.

So, (M_B/M_A)^3 ≈8 → M_B/M_A = 2 → M_B = 2 M_A.

Which confirms our earlier finding that M1b=2 M1a.

So, the total mass M1 = M_A + M_B = 3 M_A.

Similarly, for system_2:

K2a=15, K2b=10, P=1 year.

Compute f_A and f_B.

f_A = (15^3 *1 ) / 2942 = (3375) /2942 ≈ 1.147 Msun.

f_B = (10^3 *1 ) / 2942 ≈ 1000 /2942 ≈0.340 Msun.

So, f_A = (M_B^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) =1.147.

f_B = (M_A^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 ) =0.340.

Taking the ratio f_A/f_B = (M_B^3/M_A^3 ) = (1.147)/(0.340) ≈3.373 → cube root of 3.373 ≈1.5 → M_B =1.5 M_A.

So, M2b=1.5 M2a → M2 = M2a + M2b = M2a + 1.5 M2a =2.5 M2a.

Now, we have M1=3 M1a and M2=2.5 M2a.

But we need to find the ratio M1/M2.

But wait, how do we relate M1a and M2a? Because without knowing the actual masses, perhaps I can find the ratio using the periods and the mass functions.

Wait, another approach: since the mass functions are given, and the mass functions are f(M) = (M_companion^3 )/( (M_total)^2 ), perhaps we can relate the two systems.

But for system_1, f_A =0.679 = (M_B^3) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

We know M_B=2 M_A, so M_total=3 M_A.

So f_A = ( (2 M_A)^3 ) / ( (3 M_A)^2 ) ) = (8 M_A^3 ) / (9 M_A^2 ) ) = (8/9) M_A.

So 0.679 = (8/9) M_A → M_A = 0.679 * (9/8) ≈ (6.111)/8 ≈0.764 Msun.

So M1 =3 M_A =3 *0.764 ≈2.292 Msun.

Similarly, for system_2:

f_A=1.147 = (M_B^3 ) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

We have M_B=1.5 M_A, so M_total=2.5 M_A.

f_A = ( (1.5 M_A)^3 ) / ( (2.5 M_A)^2 ) ) = (3.375 M_A^3 ) / (6.25 M_A^2 ) ) = (3.375/6.25) M_A = 0.54 M_A.

So, 1.147 =0.54 M_A → M_A =1.147 /0.54 ≈2.124 Msun.

So M2=2.5 M_A=2.5 *2.124≈5.31 Msun.

Wait, that can't be right because system_1 would then be less massive than system_2, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, but according to this, system_1 is 2.292 Msun, system_2 is5.31 Msun → system_1 is less massive. Which would mean the factor is less than 1. But the options are B and D as below 1, and A and C above 1.

Wait, but that would suggest system_1 is less massive than system_2, so the factor by which system_1 is more massive is less than 1. So, the options would be A, B, D.

But according to this calculation, M1=2.292, M2=5.31 → M1/M2≈0.4318.

Looking at options, option A is ~0.4, D is ~0.7. So 0.43 is closer to option A (0.4).

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.

In system_1:

f_A =0.679 = (M_B^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

But earlier, we found M_B =2 M_A.

So,

( (2 M_A)^3 ) / ( (3 M_A)^2 ) )= (8 M_A^3)/(9 M_A^2 )= (8/9) M_A =0.679 → M_A =0.679*(9/8)=0.679 *1.125= approx 0.763 Msun.

So M1=3 *0.763≈2.289 Msun.

In system_2:

f_A=1.147 = (M_B^3 )/( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

We have M_B=1.5 M_A, so:

( (1.5 M_A )^3 ) / ( (2.5 M_A )^2 ) ) = (3.375 M_A^3 ) / (6.25 M_A^2 ) )= (3.375/6.25 ) M_A =0.54 M_A.

Setting equal to f_A=1.147 → 0.54 M_A=1.147 → M_A ≈2.124 Msun.

So M2=2.5 *2.124 ≈5.31 Msun.

Thus, M1/M2=2.289/5.31≈0.431.

So, the factor is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A (~0.4). So, system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So, system_1 is about 0.4 times more massive than system_2.

Wait, but wait, the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, M1 =0.43 M2 → which means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So, it's less massive. So, the factor would be around 0.4.

But let me think again: perhaps the mass function approach is correct, but maybe I need to compare the total masses. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass function approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach with the velocity amplitudes and mass ratios, ignoring the period, was incorrect because the period is also dependent on the total mass.

Hmm, perhaps the ratio of the velocities can give the mass ratio, but the periods will affect the actual masses.

Wait, but when using the mass function, the period and velocity amplitudes are considered. So, perhaps the calculation is correct, and system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43, which is approximately option A.

But wait, the question states that the periods are 2 years and 1 year for system_1 and system_2 respectively. So, system_1 has a longer period, which suggests it's more massive?

Wait, longer period implies larger a (separation) for the same mass, or larger mass for the same a. So, from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4π² a³)/(G M). So, for a given a, a larger M would lead to a smaller P. But in our case, system_1 has a longer P, which could imply either a larger a or a smaller M.

But without knowing a, it's hard to say. So, perhaps the mass function approach is the correct way, which gives system_1 as less massive than system_2.

So, the answer would be approximately 0.4 times, which is option A.

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data about the binary star systems. Both systems exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year for system_1 and system_2, respectively. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, while for system_2, they are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The goal is to compare the total masses of the two systems.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Ratio from Velocity Amplitudes**:
   - In a binary system, the velocity amplitude of a star is inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship arises because the more massive star has a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity.
   - For system_1:
     - \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
     - The mass ratio is \( \frac{M_{1b}}{M_{1a}} = \frac{K_{1a}}{K_{1b}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \).
     - Thus, \( M_{1b} = 2 M_{1a} \), and the total mass of system_1 is \( M_1 = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 3 M_{1a} \).
   - For system_2:
     - \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
     - The mass ratio is \( \frac{M_{2b}}{M_{2a}} = \frac{K_{2a}}{K_{2b}} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \).
     - Thus, \( M_{2b} = 1.5 M_{2a} \), and the total mass of system_2 is \( M_2 = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = 2.5 M_{2a} \).

2. **Mass Function and Total Mass**:
   - The mass function \( f(M) \) relates the RV amplitudes, periods, and masses. For an eclipsing binary, \( \sin i \approx 1 \), so:
     \[
     f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{2942}, \quad f(M) = \frac{M_{\text{companion}}^3}{(M_{\text{total}})^2}.
     \]
   - For system_1:
     - Using \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \):
       \[
       f(M)_{1a} = \frac{10^3 \cdot 2}{2942} \approx 0.679 \, M_\odot.
       \]
     - Using \( K_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \):
       \[
       f(M)_{1b} = \frac{5^3 \cdot 2}{2942} \approx 0.085 \, M_\odot.
       \]
     - The ratio \( \frac{f(M)_{1a}}{f(M)_{1b}} = \frac{0.679}{0.085} \approx 8 \), which confirms \( M_{1b} = 2 M_{1a} \).
     - Substituting \( M_{1a} \approx 0.764 \, M_\odot \), the total mass of system_1 is:
       \[
       M_1 = 3 M_{1a} \approx 3 \cdot 0.764 = 2.292 \, M_\odot.
       \]
   - For system_2:
     - Using \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \):
       \[
       f(M)_{2a} = \frac{15^3 \cdot 1}{2942} \approx 1.147 \, M_\odot.
       \]
     - Using \( K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \):
       \[
       f(M)_{2b} = \frac{10^3 \cdot 1}{2942} \approx 0.340 \, M_\odot.
       \]
     - The ratio \( \frac{f(M)_{2a}}{f(M)_{2b}} = \frac{1.147}{0.340} \approx 3.373 \), which confirms \( M_{2b} = 1.5 M_{2a} \).
     - Substituting \( M_{2a} \approx 2.124 \, M_\odot \), the total mass of system_2 is:
       \[
       M_2 = 2.5 M_{2a} \approx 2.5 \cdot 2.124 = 5.31 \, M_\odot.
       \]

3. **Mass Ratio of System_1 to System_2**:
   - The ratio of the total masses is:
     \[
     \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{2.292}{5.31} \approx 0.43.
     \]
   - This indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

### Conclusion:
System_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.43, which is closest to option **A (~0.4)**.
