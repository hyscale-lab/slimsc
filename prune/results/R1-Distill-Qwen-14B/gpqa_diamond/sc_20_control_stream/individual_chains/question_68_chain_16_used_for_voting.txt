Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So mu_z is gamma multiplied by S_z. Got it. The magnetic field initially is along +Z. So the particle is aligned with the field, which makes sense because that's the lowest energy state.

Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off. Oh, wait, no, the original field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So initially, the particle was in a B field along Z, then it's switched to a B field along Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, oscillation frequency? So when the field changes direction, the system is no longer in equilibrium. It must precess around the new field direction. I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the field direction. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, especially regarding how this affects the components of the spin.

So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S. S is a vector operator with components Sx, Sy, Sz. Spin-1/2 means each component has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but that might come into play later.

When the magnetic field is along +Z initially, the particle's spin would be aligned or anti-aligned with the field. But when the field is switched to +Y, the system will start precessing around the Y-axis. This precession will cause the expectation values of Sx, Sy, and Sz to oscillate over time. Wait, but the question is about the z-component's average oscillation.

Hmm. So initially, when the field was along Z, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was in the eigenstate |↑z>, so S_z was ħ/2. But when the field is turned to Y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of S_y. So it will evolve over time, and the expectation values of S_z will oscillate.

I think the key here is to model the time evolution under the new magnetic field. The Hamiltonian after the field changes would be H = -mu·B, since magnetic potential energy is -mu·B. Oh wait, wait, wait. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to spin S. So mu = gamma * S, so H would be -gamma S · B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that mu equals gamma * Sz. Wait, is that the case? Oh wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma multiplied by the spin component in the z-direction? That would imply that mu is along the z-axis only, but that can't be right in a general field. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check.

The problem says: mu equals gamma * Sz. Oh, then mu is a vector, but only has a z-component, given by gamma Sz. Wait, that's a bit confusing because in general, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator, but perhaps here it's expressed as a vector in the direction of the field? Or maybe it's a simplified model. Hmm, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z, which would mean it's only in the z-direction. But when the field is along Y, that would complicate things, because the magnetic moment interacts with the field via the dot product.

Wait, no, I think I might have misunderstood. Oh, wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S, where S is a vector. So that mu has components gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz. That would make more sense because the magnetic moment would then align with the spin.

Wait, the problem says mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu is a vector where the only component is in z. That seems odd because then mu would not depend on the direction of the spin. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says "mu = gamma * Sz". It's possible that mu is a vector, and in this case, it's along the same direction as S, so perhaps mu = gamma S, where S is the vector spin operator. So that mu has components gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz. That's probably the correct interpretation. Because otherwise, if mu only has a z-component, then it would not interact with a B field along y.

So the initial condition is that the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian before the change is H_initial = - mu · B_initial. Since B_initial is along Z, H_initial = -gamma S_z B. But then the field is turned off and another along +Y is turned on, same magnitude B. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma S · B_y direction. So H = -gamma B (S · y-direction unit vector) ?

Wait, the B field is along +Y, so the unit vector is in y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S is the spin operator, so S has components Sx, Sy, Sz. So H = -gamma B Sy.

Hmm. The time evolution of the system would be governed by this Hamiltonian. So the time dependence is given by the Schrödinger equation. The state |ψ(t)⟩ is given by the time evolution operator, which is exp(-i H t / ħ).

But the question is about the expectation value of S_z, ⟨S_z⟩, as a function of time. Because the particle's magnetic moment's z-component's average value is oscillating.

Alternatively, maybe the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, which would make the initial magnetic moment along the initial field. But when the field points in Y, the magnetic moment is only in Z, so it would interact with the B field in Y via S_z and S_y? Wait, that seems conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that mu is a vector whose components are gamma times the spin components. So mu = gamma S, which is a vector. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B = gamma S · B. But B is along Y, so H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but let's think about the spin precession. When the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the system will precess about the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time, I believe.

The frequency of oscillation in such cases is determined by the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, in a magnetic field along Z, the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), but when the field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y. The precession frequency is related to the energy splitting.

The energy splitting in a magnetic field B is proportional to B. The frequency of oscillations in the expectation value is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. So let's compute the energy levels when the field is along Y.

The new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E = - gamma B * (± ħ/2 ) = ± (gamma B ħ / 2 ) * (-1) ? Wait, wait no. Let me compute.

Wait, H = - gamma B Sy. Sy in the eigenbasis has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So when multiplied by -gamma B, the eigenvalues become E = - gamma B ( ± ħ/2 ). So E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), since the negative of ± is ∓.

Wait, no: If Sy has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, then H = -gamma B Sy would have eigenvalues -gamma B*(+ħ/2) and -gamma B*(-ħ/2) → -gamma B ħ/2 and +gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy difference between the two levels is (E_+ - E_-) = gamma B ħ/2 - (- gamma B ħ/2 )= gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillations is the energy difference divided by ħ, so (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B. Wait, that's the energy difference. So the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, but that would suggest the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B. Hmm, but wait, I'm not so sure. Because when the state is a superposition of the eigenstates, the expectation value oscillates sinusoidally with a frequency determined by the energy difference.

Wait, let me model this more carefully. Suppose the particle starts in the state |↑z⟩, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is suddenly changed to Y, the state remains |↑z⟩, but now the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

The initial state is |↑z⟩. Let's express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H. To find the time evolution, we can write |↑z⟩ as a combination of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

Wait, |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are the eigenstates of Sy, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The state |↑z⟩ can be written as a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let me recall that:

|↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) / sqrt(2)

Is that correct? Let me think about the basis states. The |+y⟩ state is (|+x⟩ + |−x⟩)/sqrt(2), but wait, perhaps I should look at the actual transformation between the bases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the state in the eigenbasis of H, which is Sy.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

Expressing |↑z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|↑z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |−y⟩.

To find a and b, we can use the fact that the eigenstates in different bases can be found via rotation.

Alternatively, I might recall that:

|+y⟩ = (|+x⟩ + |−x⟩)/sqrt(2)
|−y⟩ = (|+x⟩ − |−x⟩)/sqrt(2)

But perhaps that's not the quickest way. Another approach is to realize that the spin states can be rotated from each other.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that |↑z⟩ is equal to ( |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2). Let me check.

Expressing |↑z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let me use the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates can be written as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/sqrt(2)
|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − |−z⟩)/sqrt(2)

So solving for |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|+z⟩ = ( |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

That's correct. So the initial state |↑z⟩ is (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2).

So the state after the field change is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution is given by each eigenstate evolving with a phase factor exp(-i E t / ħ). So:

|ψ(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2)
E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2)

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{-i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify exponents:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we need to find the expectation value of S_z at time t.

⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

But |ψ(t)⟩ is expressed in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, so perhaps it's easier to compute this expectation value by expanding.

Alternatively, express S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, the matrix representation of S_z in the basis |+y⟩, |−y⟩.

In the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, the spin matrices can be expressed as rotations. Let me think. The Sz operator in the y-basis can be found using the rotation from the z-basis to the y-basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ states. Let me recall that:

S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) [something] |+y⟩ ?

Wait, perhaps more straightforwardly, express S_z in terms of the raising and lowering operators.

S_z = (1/2)( |+z⟩⟨+z| - |−z⟩⟨−z| )

But in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, |+z⟩ is (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2), and |−z⟩ is (|+y⟩ − |−y⟩)/sqrt(2).

So,

S_z = (1/2)( |+y + ⟩⟨+y +| − |+y − ⟩⟨+y −| )

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Let me compute the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

The matrix elements are:

⟨+y | S_z | +y ⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨+y | (|+z⟩⟨+z| - |−z⟩⟨−z| ) |+y⟩

But |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2), so:

⟨+y | +z ⟩ = 1/sqrt(2), ⟨+y | −z ⟩ = 1/sqrt(2)

So,

⟨+y | S_z | +y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ |⟨+y | +z ⟩|^2 - |⟨+y | −z ⟩ |^2 ]

= (ħ/2) [ (1/√2)^2 - (1/√2)^2 ] = 0.

Similarly,

⟨+y | S_z | −y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ ⟨+y| +z ⟩ ⟨−y| +z ⟩^* - ⟨+y| −z ⟩ ⟨−y| −z ⟩^* ]

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too stuck here. Another approach: the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ can be found by expanding |ψ(t)⟩ in the eigenstates of S_z and then taking the expectation value.

Alternatively, since |ψ(t)⟩ is a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, perhaps we can compute ⟨S_z⟩ by expressing S_z in terms of the ladder operators.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let's think about the time evolution. The state |ψ(t)⟩ is a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, each with a phase factor. 

The expectation value of S_z is given by:

⟨S_z⟩ = (1/2) [⟨ψ(t)| +z⟩⟨+z|ψ(t)⟩ - ⟨ψ(t)| -z⟩⟨−z|ψ(t)⟩ ]

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, S_z can be represented as a matrix in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis. Let me find that matrix.

In the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, the spin matrices can be found by rotating the standard spin matrices. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the spin matrices in different bases are related by rotation matrices.

The standard spin matrices for Sx, Sy, Sz are known, but when you rotate the coordinate system, the matrix elements change accordingly.

For example, a rotation by 90 degrees around the x-axis will take the z-axis to the y-axis. So perhaps the S_z matrix in the y-basis is obtained by rotating the standard Sz matrix.

The rotation of spin matrices can be done using the rotation operator. For a rotation around the x-axis by angle theta, the rotation operator is R_x(theta) = exp( -i theta Sx / ħ )

But perhaps a 90-degree rotation around x (theta=pi/2) would take the z-axis to the y-axis. Let me think.

Wait, a 90-degree rotation around x will transform the z-axis into the y-axis. So the transformed Sz matrix would be Sy. No, wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think more carefully.

The rotation matrices for the coordinate system are such that a rotation by theta around x will take the standard basis vectors (x,y,z) to new vectors. But for spin, the operator transformation is given by:

R† S R, where R is the rotation operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix for S_z in the y-axis basis can be found through a rotation. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the basis states |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are eigenstates of Sy, and express S_z in this basis.

The matrix elements of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis can be found using the fact that:

S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ ] |+y⟩ + [ ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ] |−y⟩.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the expectation value of S_z in the state |ψ(t)⟩.

Express |ψ(t)⟩ as (e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } ⟨+y| + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ⟨−y| ] S_z (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ]

Multiply the terms:

= (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t} ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{i 0} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{0} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t} ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ ]

As I calculated before, ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0, and ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ = 0.

So those terms drop out.

Now, the remaining terms:

= (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ]

But S_z is hermitian, so ⟨a| S_z | b⟩ = ⟨b| S_z |a⟩^*.

So,

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩^*.

Let me compute ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Express |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)
|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

So,

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = [ ⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ] / sqrt(2) * S_z * [ |+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩
S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩

So,

= [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) / sqrt(2) ] * ( (ħ/2) |+z⟩ - (ħ/2) |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

= (ħ/2) [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) ( |+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ) ] / 2

Multiplying terms inside:

⟨+z| |+z⟩ = 1
⟨+z| |−z⟩ = 0
⟨−z| |+z⟩ = 0
⟨−z| |−z⟩ =1

So,

= (ħ/2) [ (1 - 0 + 0 -1 ) ] / 2

= (ħ/2) (0) /2 = 0.

Wait, that's zero? That can't be right because that would make ⟨S_z⟩ zero, which contradicts the expectation that it oscillates.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express this.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ again.

Alternatively, I can note that in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, the matrix for S_z is:

[ 0 , 1 ] [ something ]

Wait, perhaps I should think about the matrix elements for S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Using the standard rotation matrices for spin operators, a rotation about x by 90 degrees brings the z-axis into the y-axis. So, the S_z matrix in the rotated (y-axis) basis would be the same as the S_y matrix in the original (z-axis) basis. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that a spin-1/2 particle's spin matrices can be expressed in any direction. For example, the spin matrices in the direction of a unit vector (a, b, c) would be proportional to a Sx + b Sy + c Sz, but normalized.

But maybe that's more complicated. Another approach: perhaps I can find the matrix elements by using the fact that |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are superpositions of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

So, to compute ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩:

= [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) / sqrt(2) ] S_z [ (|+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ]

= (1/2) [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) ( S_z |+z⟩ - S_z |−z⟩ ) ]

S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩
S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩

So,

= (1/2) [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) ( (ħ/2)|+z⟩ + (ħ/2)|−z⟩ ) ]

= (ħ/4) [ ⟨+z| +z ⟩ + ⟨+z| −z ⟩ + ⟨−z| +z ⟩ + ⟨−z| −z ⟩ ]

= (ħ/4) [ 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 ]

= (ħ/4)(2) = ħ/2.

So, ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was zero. I must have made a mistake earlier. So this term is ħ/2.

Similarly, ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ would be the complex conjugate, but since it's real, it's also ħ/2.

So, going back to the expression for ⟨S_z⟩:

⟨S_z⟩ = (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t} (ħ/2) + e^{-i gamma B t} (ħ/2) ]

= (ħ/4) [ e^{i gamma B t} + e^{-i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait a second—this is for the expectation value of S_z, which is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨mu_z⟩, would be gamma * ⟨S_z⟩.

Which would be gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, in terms of angular frequency, the argument of the cosine is omega t, where omega is the angular frequency. So in this case, the argument is gamma B t, meaning the angular frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩ is gamma B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but I should double-check. So the expectation value ⟨mu_z⟩ is gamma times (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, let me think again about the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency omega is given by gamma B, right? So that seems consistent.

But wait, in some derivations I've seen, the precession frequency omega is equal to gamma B. So that would match.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's spin precesses around the new field direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator: **μ = γS**, where **S** has components **S_x**, **S_y**, and **S_z**.  
   - Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z**, say **|↑_z⟩**, with **S_z = ħ/2**.  
   - The magnetic field is suddenly turned off in the +Z direction and turned on in the +Y direction, with the same magnitude **B**.  

2. **New Hamiltonian**:  
   - After the field switches to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes **H = -μ · B = -γB S_y**.  
   - The eigenstates of **S_y** are **|+y⟩** and **|−y⟩**, with eigenvalues **±ħ/2**.  

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   - The initial state **|↑_z⟩** is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of **S_y**:  
     \[
     |↑_z⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y⟩ + |−y⟩).
     \]
   - Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:  
     \[
     |ψ(t)⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-iE_-t/ħ} |−y⟩ \right),
     \]
     where **E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)** and **E_- = γB(ħ/2)**.  

4. **Expectation Value of S_z**:  
   - The expectation value of **S_z** is computed as:  
     \[
     ⟨S_z⟩ = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^{iγBt} + e^{-iγBt} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2}.
     \]
   - Simplifying, this becomes:  
     \[
     ⟨S_z⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{4} \cos(γBt).
     \]

5. **Expectation Value of μ_z**:  
   - The magnetic moment's z-component is **μ_z = γS_z**, so:  
     \[
     ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩ = γ \cdot \frac{\hbar}{4} \cos(γBt).
     \]
   - The oscillation frequency of **⟨μ_z⟩** is determined by the argument of the cosine term, which is **γB**.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is **γB**, corresponding to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So mu_z is gamma multiplied by S_z. Got it. The magnetic field initially is along +Z. So the particle is aligned with the field, which makes sense because that's the lowest energy state.

Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off. Oh, wait, no, the original field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So initially, the particle was in a B field along Z, then it's switched to a B field along Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, oscillation frequency? So when the field changes direction, the system is no longer in equilibrium. It must precess around the new field direction. I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the field direction. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, especially regarding how this affects the components of the spin.

So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S. S is a vector operator with components Sx, Sy, Sz. Spin-1/2 means each component has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but that might come into play later.

When the magnetic field is along +Z initially, the particle's spin would be aligned or anti-aligned with the field. But when the field is switched to +Y, the system will start precessing around the Y-axis. This precession will cause the expectation values of Sx, Sy, and Sz to oscillate over time. Wait, but the question is about the z-component's average oscillation.

Hmm. So initially, when the field was along Z, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was in the eigenstate |↑z>, so S_z was ħ/2. But when the field is turned to Y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of S_y. So it will evolve over time, and the expectation values of S_z will oscillate.

I think the key here is to model the time evolution under the new magnetic field. The Hamiltonian after the field changes would be H = -mu·B, since magnetic potential energy is -mu·B. Oh wait, wait, wait. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to spin S. So mu = gamma * S, so H would be -gamma S · B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that mu equals gamma * Sz. Wait, is that the case? Oh wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma multiplied by the spin component in the z-direction? That would imply that mu is along the z-axis only, but that can't be right in a general field. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check.

The problem says: mu equals gamma * Sz. Oh, then mu is a vector, but only has a z-component, given by gamma Sz. Wait, that's a bit confusing because in general, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator, but perhaps here it's expressed as a vector in the direction of the field? Or maybe it's a simplified model. Hmm, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z, which would mean it's only in the z-direction. But when the field is along Y, that would complicate things, because the magnetic moment interacts with the field via the dot product.

Wait, no, I think I might have misunderstood. Oh, wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S, where S is a vector. So that mu has components gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz. That would make more sense because the magnetic moment would then align with the spin.

Wait, the problem says mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu is a vector where the only component is in z. That seems odd because then mu would not depend on the direction of the spin. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says "mu = gamma * Sz". It's possible that mu is a vector, and in this case, it's along the same direction as S, so perhaps mu = gamma S, where S is the vector spin operator. So that mu has components gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz. That's probably the correct interpretation. Because otherwise, if mu only has a z-component, then it would not interact with a B field along y.

So the initial condition is that the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian before the change is H_initial = - mu · B_initial. Since B_initial is along Z, H_initial = -gamma S_z B. But then the field is turned off and another along +Y is turned on, same magnitude B. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma S · B_y direction. So H = -gamma B (S · y-direction unit vector) ?

Wait, the B field is along +Y, so the unit vector is in y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S is the spin operator, so S has components Sx, Sy, Sz. So H = -gamma B Sy.

Hmm. The time evolution of the system would be governed by this Hamiltonian. So the time dependence is given by the Schrödinger equation. The state |ψ(t)⟩ is given by the time evolution operator, which is exp(-i H t / ħ).

But the question is about the expectation value of S_z, ⟨S_z⟩, as a function of time. Because the particle's magnetic moment's z-component's average value is oscillating.

Alternatively, maybe the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, which would make the initial magnetic moment along the initial field. But when the field points in Y, the magnetic moment is only in Z, so it would interact with the B field in Y via S_z and S_y? Wait, that seems conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that mu is a vector whose components are gamma times the spin components. So mu = gamma S, which is a vector. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B = gamma S · B. But B is along Y, so H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but let's think about the spin precession. When the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the system will precess about the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time, I believe.

The frequency of oscillation in such cases is determined by the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, in a magnetic field along Z, the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), but when the field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y. The precession frequency is related to the energy splitting.

The energy splitting in a magnetic field B is proportional to B. The frequency of oscillations in the expectation value is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. So let's compute the energy levels when the field is along Y.

The new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E = - gamma B * (± ħ/2 ) = ± (gamma B ħ / 2 ) * (-1) ? Wait, wait no. Let me compute.

Wait, H = - gamma B Sy. Sy in the eigenbasis has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So when multiplied by -gamma B, the eigenvalues become E = - gamma B ( ± ħ/2 ). So E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), since the negative of ± is ∓.

Wait, no: If Sy has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, then H = -gamma B Sy would have eigenvalues -gamma B*(+ħ/2) and -gamma B*(-ħ/2) → -gamma B ħ/2 and +gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy difference between the two levels is (E_+ - E_-) = gamma B ħ/2 - (- gamma B ħ/2 )= gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillations is the energy difference divided by ħ, so (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B. Wait, that's the energy difference. So the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, but that would suggest the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B. Hmm, but wait, I'm not so sure. Because when the state is a superposition of the eigenstates, the expectation value oscillates sinusoidally with a frequency determined by the energy difference.

Wait, let me model this more carefully. Suppose the particle starts in the state |↑z⟩, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is suddenly changed to Y, the state remains |↑z⟩, but now the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

The initial state is |↑z⟩. Let's express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H. To find the time evolution, we can write |↑z⟩ as a combination of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

Wait, |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are the eigenstates of Sy, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The state |↑z⟩ can be written as a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let me recall that:

|↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) / sqrt(2)

Is that correct? Let me think about the basis states. The |+y⟩ state is (|+x⟩ + |−x⟩)/sqrt(2), but wait, perhaps I should look at the actual transformation between the bases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the state in the eigenbasis of H, which is Sy.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

Expressing |↑z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|↑z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |−y⟩.

To find a and b, we can use the fact that the eigenstates in different bases can be found via rotation.

Alternatively, I might recall that:

|+y⟩ = (|+x⟩ + |−x⟩)/sqrt(2)
|−y⟩ = (|+x⟩ − |−x⟩)/sqrt(2)

But perhaps that's not the quickest way. Another approach is to realize that the spin states can be rotated from each other.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that |↑z⟩ is equal to ( |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2). Let me check.

Expressing |↑z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let me use the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates can be written as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/sqrt(2)
|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − |−z⟩)/sqrt(2)

So solving for |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|+z⟩ = ( |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

That's correct. So the initial state |↑z⟩ is (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2).

So the state after the field change is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution is given by each eigenstate evolving with a phase factor exp(-i E t / ħ). So:

|ψ(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2)
E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2)

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{-i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify exponents:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we need to find the expectation value of S_z at time t.

⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

But |ψ(t)⟩ is expressed in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, so perhaps it's easier to compute this expectation value by expanding.

Alternatively, express S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, the matrix representation of S_z in the basis |+y⟩, |−y⟩.

In the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, the spin matrices can be expressed as rotations. Let me think. The Sz operator in the y-basis can be found using the rotation from the z-basis to the y-basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ states. Let me recall that:

S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) [something] |+y⟩ ?

Wait, perhaps more straightforwardly, express S_z in terms of the raising and lowering operators.

S_z = (1/2)( |+z⟩⟨+z| - |−z⟩⟨−z| )

But in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, |+z⟩ is (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2), and |−z⟩ is (|+y⟩ − |−y⟩)/sqrt(2).

So,

S_z = (1/2)( |+y + ⟩⟨+y +| − |+y − ⟩⟨+y −| )

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Let me compute the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

The matrix elements are:

⟨+y | S_z | +y ⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨+y | (|+z⟩⟨+z| - |−z⟩⟨−z| ) |+y⟩

But |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt(2), so:

⟨+y | +z ⟩ = 1/sqrt(2), ⟨+y | −z ⟩ = 1/sqrt(2)

So,

⟨+y | S_z | +y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ |⟨+y | +z ⟩|^2 - |⟨+y | −z ⟩ |^2 ]

= (ħ/2) [ (1/√2)^2 - (1/√2)^2 ] = 0.

Similarly,

⟨+y | S_z | −y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ ⟨+y| +z ⟩ ⟨−y| +z ⟩^* - ⟨+y| −z ⟩ ⟨−y| −z ⟩^* ]

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too stuck here. Another approach: the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ can be found by expanding |ψ(t)⟩ in the eigenstates of S_z and then taking the expectation value.

Alternatively, since |ψ(t)⟩ is a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, perhaps we can compute ⟨S_z⟩ by expressing S_z in terms of the ladder operators.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let's think about the time evolution. The state |ψ(t)⟩ is a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, each with a phase factor. 

The expectation value of S_z is given by:

⟨S_z⟩ = (1/2) [⟨ψ(t)| +z⟩⟨+z|ψ(t)⟩ - ⟨ψ(t)| -z⟩⟨−z|ψ(t)⟩ ]

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, S_z can be represented as a matrix in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis. Let me find that matrix.

In the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, the spin matrices can be found by rotating the standard spin matrices. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the spin matrices in different bases are related by rotation matrices.

The standard spin matrices for Sx, Sy, Sz are known, but when you rotate the coordinate system, the matrix elements change accordingly.

For example, a rotation by 90 degrees around the x-axis will take the z-axis to the y-axis. So perhaps the S_z matrix in the y-basis is obtained by rotating the standard Sz matrix.

The rotation of spin matrices can be done using the rotation operator. For a rotation around the x-axis by angle theta, the rotation operator is R_x(theta) = exp( -i theta Sx / ħ )

But perhaps a 90-degree rotation around x (theta=pi/2) would take the z-axis to the y-axis. Let me think.

Wait, a 90-degree rotation around x will transform the z-axis into the y-axis. So the transformed Sz matrix would be Sy. No, wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think more carefully.

The rotation matrices for the coordinate system are such that a rotation by theta around x will take the standard basis vectors (x,y,z) to new vectors. But for spin, the operator transformation is given by:

R† S R, where R is the rotation operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix for S_z in the y-axis basis can be found through a rotation. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the basis states |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are eigenstates of Sy, and express S_z in this basis.

The matrix elements of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis can be found using the fact that:

S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ ] |+y⟩ + [ ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ] |−y⟩.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the expectation value of S_z in the state |ψ(t)⟩.

Express |ψ(t)⟩ as (e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } ⟨+y| + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ⟨−y| ] S_z (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ]

Multiply the terms:

= (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t} ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{i 0} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{0} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t} ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ ]

As I calculated before, ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0, and ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ = 0.

So those terms drop out.

Now, the remaining terms:

= (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ]

But S_z is hermitian, so ⟨a| S_z | b⟩ = ⟨b| S_z |a⟩^*.

So,

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩^*.

Let me compute ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Express |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)
|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

So,

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = [ ⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ] / sqrt(2) * S_z * [ |+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩
S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩

So,

= [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) / sqrt(2) ] * ( (ħ/2) |+z⟩ - (ħ/2) |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

= (ħ/2) [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) ( |+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ) ] / 2

Multiplying terms inside:

⟨+z| |+z⟩ = 1
⟨+z| |−z⟩ = 0
⟨−z| |+z⟩ = 0
⟨−z| |−z⟩ =1

So,

= (ħ/2) [ (1 - 0 + 0 -1 ) ] / 2

= (ħ/2) (0) /2 = 0.

Wait, that's zero? That can't be right because that would make ⟨S_z⟩ zero, which contradicts the expectation that it oscillates.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express this.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ again.

Alternatively, I can note that in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, the matrix for S_z is:

[ 0 , 1 ] [ something ]

Wait, perhaps I should think about the matrix elements for S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Using the standard rotation matrices for spin operators, a rotation about x by 90 degrees brings the z-axis into the y-axis. So, the S_z matrix in the rotated (y-axis) basis would be the same as the S_y matrix in the original (z-axis) basis. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that a spin-1/2 particle's spin matrices can be expressed in any direction. For example, the spin matrices in the direction of a unit vector (a, b, c) would be proportional to a Sx + b Sy + c Sz, but normalized.

But maybe that's more complicated. Another approach: perhaps I can find the matrix elements by using the fact that |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are superpositions of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

So, to compute ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩:

= [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) / sqrt(2) ] S_z [ (|+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ]

= (1/2) [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) ( S_z |+z⟩ - S_z |−z⟩ ) ]

S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩
S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩

So,

= (1/2) [ (⟨+z| + ⟨−z| ) ( (ħ/2)|+z⟩ + (ħ/2)|−z⟩ ) ]

= (ħ/4) [ ⟨+z| +z ⟩ + ⟨+z| −z ⟩ + ⟨−z| +z ⟩ + ⟨−z| −z ⟩ ]

= (ħ/4) [ 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 ]

= (ħ/4)(2) = ħ/2.

So, ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was zero. I must have made a mistake earlier. So this term is ħ/2.

Similarly, ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ would be the complex conjugate, but since it's real, it's also ħ/2.

So, going back to the expression for ⟨S_z⟩:

⟨S_z⟩ = (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t} (ħ/2) + e^{-i gamma B t} (ħ/2) ]

= (ħ/4) [ e^{i gamma B t} + e^{-i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait a second—this is for the expectation value of S_z, which is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨mu_z⟩, would be gamma * ⟨S_z⟩.

Which would be gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, in terms of angular frequency, the argument of the cosine is omega t, where omega is the angular frequency. So in this case, the argument is gamma B t, meaning the angular frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩ is gamma B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but I should double-check. So the expectation value ⟨mu_z⟩ is gamma times (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, let me think again about the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency omega is given by gamma B, right? So that seems consistent.

But wait, in some derivations I've seen, the precession frequency omega is equal to gamma B. So that would match.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's spin precesses around the new field direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator: **μ = γS**, where **S** has components **S_x**, **S_y**, and **S_z**.  
   - Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z**, say **|↑_z⟩**, with **S_z = ħ/2**.  
   - The magnetic field is suddenly turned off in the +Z direction and turned on in the +Y direction, with the same magnitude **B**.  

2. **New Hamiltonian**:  
   - After the field switches to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes **H = -μ · B = -γB S_y**.  
   - The eigenstates of **S_y** are **|+y⟩** and **|−y⟩**, with eigenvalues **±ħ/2**.  

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   - The initial state **|↑_z⟩** is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of **S_y**:  
     \[
     |↑_z⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y⟩ + |−y⟩).
     \]
   - Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:  
     \[
     |ψ(t)⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-iE_-t/ħ} |−y⟩ \right),
     \]
     where **E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)** and **E_- = γB(ħ/2)**.  

4. **Expectation Value of S_z**:  
   - The expectation value of **S_z** is computed as:  
     \[
     ⟨S_z⟩ = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^{iγBt} + e^{-iγBt} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2}.
     \]
   - Simplifying, this becomes:  
     \[
     ⟨S_z⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{4} \cos(γBt).
     \]

5. **Expectation Value of μ_z**:  
   - The magnetic moment's z-component is **μ_z = γS_z**, so:  
     \[
     ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩ = γ \cdot \frac{\hbar}{4} \cos(γBt).
     \]
   - The oscillation frequency of **⟨μ_z⟩** is determined by the argument of the cosine term, which is **γB**.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is **γB**, corresponding to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
