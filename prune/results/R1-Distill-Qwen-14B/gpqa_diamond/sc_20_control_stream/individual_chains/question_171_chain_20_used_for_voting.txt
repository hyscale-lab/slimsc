Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrophilic substitution reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when six substances undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. Each substance is a benzene derivative, so substituents attached to the ring will influence where the bromine adds.

I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effect of the substituents determines where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will attack. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) are meta directors, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) are ortho/para directors. 

Wait, but wait, some substituents are stronger directors than others. So the activating or deactivating nature of the substituent also affects the reactivity of the ring. Activating groups (like EDGs) make the ring more reactive, so substitution occurs more readily. Deactivating groups (like EWGs) make the ring less reactive. But regardless of activating or deactivating, the directing effect is what's important for where the substitution happens.

But in this question, we're looking at the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, the percentage of para product will determine how much of the para-isomer is formed.

Let me list out each substituent and think about their directing effects:

1) С6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an EDG, so it's ortho/para directing. So, the bromine can add either ortho, meta, or para to the methyl group. Wait, no, methyl is EDG, so it's ortho/para. So, the major products would be ortho and para. But since the substituent is bulky, perhaps para is more favored? Or maybe the substituent is activating, so the ring is more reactive, so bromine adds more in activated positions.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of para isomer. So when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the para product is one of the major possibilities.

But wait, the exact distribution between ortho and para depends on the substituent's ability to direct. Bulky groups might favor para because ortho positions are too crowded. For example, a bulky EDG like -CH2CH3 (ethyl) might lead to more para product because ortho is hindered. So, in this case, substance 5 is C6H5-C2H5 (benzyl ethyl?), or wait, no, it's ethylbenzene? No, wait: 5 is C6H5-C2H5, which would be ethyl attached to benzene. So, ethyl is an EDG, ortho/para director. But being a bulky group, maybe the para is the major product.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, how much does the para product form compared to ortho or meta.

Let me go step by step for each substituent:

Substance 1: C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
Substituent: methyl (-CH3). Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Since the ring is activated, substitution occurs easily. But with a methyl group, which is bulky, the ortho positions are more hindered, so the para isomer is more favored. So the major product is the para bromotoluene.

So the weight fraction of para is high.

Substance 2: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxyethyl? Wait, no, wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. So it's an ester group: -COOEt (ethyl ester). The substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an ester. Wait, the group is -COOEt. Wait, no, the structure is benzene ring with a carbonyloxyethyl group?

Wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. So that's benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (O=C-O-Et). The substituent is an ester group, like OAc (acetate) but with ethyl. So the substituent is an ester group, which is -COOEt.

Wait, ester groups are EWGs because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So substituents like -COOR are meta directors. Because they are deactivating (since EWG) and meta directing. So when a substituent is meta directing, the incoming electrophile will add to the meta position relative to it.

So in this case, the substituent is meta directing, so the para isomer would not be a major product. Wait, but wait, meta is the main product, so the para would be minor. Alternatively, maybe for some substituents, the meta is the only product, but with multiple substituents, perhaps some ortho and para can form.

Wait, no, substituents that are meta directing don’t produce para products. Or do they? I think if a substituent is meta directing, the electrophile adds to the meta position. So the para is not a major product. So, the para isomer would have a lower weight fraction.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. If the substituent is meta-directing, then the most product is in the meta position. So the para product would be much less. So the weight fraction of the para isomer would be low. So in substance 2, the para isomer is minimal.

Substance 3: C6H5-Cl
Substituent: Cl atom. Chlorine is an EWG, but since it's attached to a benzene ring, it's ortho/para directing because of its lone pairs. Wait, yes, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So it's a weakly deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive, but substitution occurs at ortho and para positions.

So, for Cl, the para product is a major product, but less than if it's an activating group. So the para isomer would have a high weight fraction.

Substance 4: C6H5-NO2
Substituent: nitro group (-NO2). Nitro is a strong EWG, so it's a meta director. So the incoming Br would add to the meta position. So the para product is not formed much. So the weight fraction of para is low.

Wait, but wait. Actually, nitro is a meta director. So when you have nitrobenzene undergoing electrophilic substitution, the Br adds mainly to the meta position relative to NO2. So para product would be minor, so the fraction is low.

Substance 5: C6H5-C2H5
Substituent: ethyl (-CH2CH3). This is an EDG, so it's ortho/para directing. Now, ethyl is bulkier than methyl. So, in such cases, the para position is more favored because the ortho positions are more crowded. So para product is the major one. So the weight fraction of para is high.

Substance 6: C6H5-COOH
Substituent: -COOH (carboxylic acid group). This is a strong EWG, so it's a meta director. So, the Br will add to the meta position, so the para product is minor. Therefore, the weight fraction of para is low.

Now, I need to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the substance with the smallest fraction comes first, then next, etc.

So, let me list the substituents and their para fractions:

1) CH3: Para is major, so high fraction.

2) COOEt: Meta directing, so para is low.

3) Cl: Para is major, so high.

4) NO2: Meta, para is low.

5) C2H5: Para is major, but maybe more than methyl because ethyl is bulkier. So higher than substance 1.

Wait, but in substitution, the directing effect is that EDGs are ortho/para. So for both 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl), the para is a major product.

But I thought that bulkier groups like ethyl would lead to more para substitution because the ortho is hindered, making the para more favored. So for ethylbenzene (substance 5), the para product is higher than toluene (substance 1). So, the weight fraction in 5 would be higher than 1.

Wait, but when the substituent is bulky, the para product is more favored. So for toluene (methyl), the para is major but perhaps not as much as ethyl.

So, for substance 5, the para fraction is higher than 1. So, which has higher para fraction: 5 > 1.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Substituents that are ortho/para directing: such as methyl, ethyl, Cl.

Methyl is an EDG, so it's activating. So in toluene, the ring is more reactive, substitution is more likely. But since methyl is not too bulky, both ortho and para are possible. But methyl is less bulky than ethyl, so perhaps in ethylbenzene, the ortho is more hindered, leading to more para.

So, for para fractions:

Substance 5 (ethyl) > Substance 1 (methyl) > Substance 3 (Cl) ?

Wait, no. Wait, Cl is a deactivating group (EWG) but ortho/para director. So compared to activating groups, the Cl-substituted benzene is less reactive, but the para product is still formed.

So, in terms of para fraction, the order would be: the more activating the substituent (more EDG), the more the para product.

Wait, but Cl is a weaker EDG than methyl. Because methyl is EDG (activating), Cl is EDG (activating) but less so than methyl? Or wait, no, Cl is actually a deactivating group because it's an EWG. Wait, no: Cl has lone pairs, which can donate electrons through resonance, which makes it an ortho/para director, but it's a deactivating group because the inductive effect of Cl is electron-withdrawing.

So, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So, compared to activating groups (like methyl, ethyl), the para fraction might be lower for Cl than for methyl or ethyl.

Wait, but directionally, Cl directs to ortho and para, so the para is present, but the overall reactivity is lower. So the para fraction would be significant but perhaps less than in the case of methyl or ethyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to rank the substituents based on their para product.

Let me list each substance and their substituent's effect on para product:

Substance | Substituent | Para Product Weight Fraction
--- | --- | ---
1 | CH3 (EDG, ortho/para) | High (since activating)
2 | COOEt (EWG, meta) | Low (para is minor)
3 | Cl (EWG, ortho/para) | Moderate (para is a product, but group is deactivating)
4 | NO2 (EWG, meta) | Very Low (para is minor)
5 | C2H5 (EDG, ortho/para) | Very High (bulkier, so more para)
6 | COOH (EWG, meta) | Low (para is minor)

Wait, so for each substituent:

- 2: COOEt (ester) is EWG, meta director. Para is minor → low fraction.
- 4: NO2 is EWG, meta. So para is minor → low.
- 6: COOH is EWG, meta. So also low.
- 3: Cl is EWG, ortho/para. So para is a major product, but less than activating groups → moderate.
- 1: CH3 is EDG, activating, ortho/para. Para is major → high.
- 5: C2H5 is EDG, activating, ortho/para, but bulkier → para is very high.

So the para fractions from highest to lowest:

5 > 1 > 3 > [others with lower fractions].

Wait, but wait, Cl is a deactivating group. So for Cl, the para product is formed but maybe in lower amounts than for activating groups. For example, toluene (1) has a high para fraction, ethylbenzene (5) has even higher, Cl (3) has moderate, and the others (2,4,6) have low.

So the order of increasing para fractions would be: the ones with the lowest para first, then higher.

So looking for the substances in order from least para to most:

Lowest para:

4 (NO2) → 6 (COOH) → 2 (COOEt) → 3 (Cl) → 1 (CH3) → 5 (C2H5).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

Which substituents have the least para product? Those that are meta directors. So 2,4,6: their para fractions are low.

Among these, perhaps substituents like NO2 are stronger deactivators, so less reactive, but their directing leads to meta. So their para fraction would be the lowest.

Then, substituents like COOEt and COOH (substance 2 and 6) are also meta directors, so their para fractions are low. But how do they compare? Both are EWGs, but maybe NO2 is a stronger EWG than COOEt and COOH. Wait, carboxylic acid is a stronger EWG than esters. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, nitro groups are stronger deactivators than ester or carboxylic acid groups. So the para fraction for 4 (NO2) would be lower than 6 (COOH), which in turn is lower than 2 (COOEt). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait, the strength of deactivation would affect the reactivity. But for the purpose of para fraction, perhaps the stronger deactivating groups (like NO2) would lead to less substitution overall, but that's not directly about the para fraction. Because in any case, for meta directors, the majority of substitution is meta, so the para is a minor product.

Wait, but perhaps for substituents that have some ortho/para-directing but are deactivating (like Cl), the para fraction is higher than for meta directors.

So, the order from least to most para fraction would be:

Substance 4 (NO2, meta, low para) → substance 6 (COOH, meta, low) → substance 2 (COOEt, meta, low) → substance 3 (Cl, ortho/para, moderate) → substance 1 (CH3, ortho/para, high) → substance 5 (C2H5, ortho/para, highest).

Wait, but wait. Wait, in this case, the para fraction would be:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So the order from lowest to highest is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but wait, I'm not confident about the order between 6, 2, and 4 for meta directors. Let's think again.

Wait, for substituents that are meta directing, each will have a lower para fraction than the ortho/para directors. For example, 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) are all meta directors. So their para fractions are lower than the ortho/para directors (3,1,5).

But among the meta directors, which has the least para fraction? Since they are all meta directing, their para fractions are low, but perhaps the more deactivating the group, the lower the para fraction. Because the ring is less reactive, so substitution is less likely, but regardless, the para fraction comes from where the substituent directs.

Wait, but for meta directors, the substituent directs the incoming group to the meta position, so the para is not a major product. So the para fractions for 2,4,6 are all low. But how do they compare among themselves?

I think the strength of the EWG affects the reactivity. Stronger EWG → less reactive ring → less substitution, but the substituent's directing effect is about where substitution occurs.

Wait, but if the substituent is a strong EWG, the ring is less reactive, so the overall substitution is less, but the position depends on the director. So for example, nitro is a stronger EWG than COOEt. So, when you have nitro, substitution occurs at meta, but perhaps for weaker EWGs, like COOEt, the ring is more reactive, but still directs to meta.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for meta directors, the para fraction is low. But how low? For example, for substance 4 (NO2), which is a strong EWG, the para product would be very minor. For substance 6 (COOH), which is a strong EWG, perhaps the para product is a bit more than nitro but still minor. And for substance 2 (COOEt), which is less deactivating than COOH, maybe the para product is even more?

Or perhaps it's the opposite, because the stronger EWG leads to less substitution, making the para product even less.

Alternatively, maybe all meta directors have the same para fraction. But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction is determined by whether the substituent is ortho/para or meta directing. So for meta directors, the para fraction is nearly zero. But that's not true because sometimes ortho and para products can form, but they are minor.

Wait, no, the substituent directs the incoming electrophile. For meta directors, the main product is meta, but small amounts of ortho and para can form, especially in certain conditions.

But in the case of this question, we're assuming that the reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. So perhaps only the major product is considered, and others are negligible.

Wait, the question states, "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which is a bit confusing. Does that mean that each reaction produces a single product, or that the question is considering only the major product? I think it's the latter. So when each substituent undergoes substitution, the product is mainly in the position directed by the substituent.

So for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is negligible, so their weight fraction is negligible. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is a major fraction.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the para fractions would be:

Substance | Para Fraction
--- | ---
2 (COOEt) | nearly 0
4 (NO2) | nearly 0
6 (COOH) | nearly 0
3 (Cl) | major (para)
1 (CH3) | major (para)
5 (C2H5) | major (para)

Hmm, but that can't be right because then 2,4,6 would have the same fraction, but the question expects them to be arranged in increasing order. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps substituents that are meta directors may not produce any para product. So, their para fractions are zero. But no, in reality, some para products can form, albeit in minor amounts.

But the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So, perhaps each substituent leads to a single product, which is the main product. That would mean that for substituents that are meta directors, the product is the meta isomer. So, the para isomer is not formed, so the fraction is zero. Similarly, for ortho/para directors, the product is para (for the majority) or ortho.

But that doesn't make sense because the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, perhaps the products can only form in the positions directed by the substituent. So for meta directors, the product is meta, so the para fraction is zero. For ortho/para directors, the product can be either ortho or para.

But in that case, the para fraction would be as follows:

Substance 1 (CH3) → para is major, but perhaps 50% or less, depending on the substituent's bulk.

Substance 3 (Cl) → para is major, but since Cl is less activating than methyl, perhaps the para fraction is lower than toluene.

Substance 5 (C2H5) → para is major, perhaps higher than methyl.

Substances 2,4,6 → para fraction is zero.

If that's the case, then the substances 2,4,6 would have the lowest para fractions (zero), and substances 1,3,5 would have some para fractions.

But the question is about arranging all six substances in order of increasing para fraction. So, the ones with zero para fraction (2,4,6) would come first, followed by those with some para.

But the options don't have all three of 2,4,6 at the beginning. Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4,2,6 are first.

Option B: 6<2<4<5<1<3.

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Option D: 3<5<1<6<2<4.

Hmm, but according to my earlier analysis, 2,4,6 have zero para, so they should come first, but none of the options have them all at the start. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question allows for some para product even when the substituent is a meta director. For example, -COOEt is a meta director, but a small amount of para product can form.

So, for each substituent, the para fraction is as follows:

- meta directors: low para fractions.

- ortho/para directors: higher para fractions.

So, for each substance, the para fraction is as follows:

1) CH3 → para is major → high.

2) COOEt → meta → low.

3) Cl → para is major → high.

4) NO2 → meta → very low.

5) C2H5 → para is major → high.

6) COOH → meta → low.

So, the para fractions would be:

Substance 4 (NO2) → very low.

Substance 2 (COOEt) → low.

Substance 6 (COOH) → low.

Substance 3 (Cl) → moderate (since Cl is ortho/para but deactivating).

Substance 1 (CH3) → high.

Substance 5 (C2H5) → highest.

Now, arranging from lowest to highest para fraction:

4 (NO2) has the least, then 2 (COOEt), then 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5) as the highest.

So the order is 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 <5.

Looking at the options, Option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. So that's option A.

Wait, but why is 6 after 2? Because COOH is a stronger EWG than COOEt, so perhaps the para fraction is lower than for COOEt. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, for substituents that are meta-directing, the para fraction is low, but the strength of the EWG would determine how low.

Wait, perhaps substituents that are stronger EWGs result in lower para fractions because the ring is less reactive, but the meta director leads to more meta substitution. But for the purpose of para fractions, the main determinant is the directing effect.

So, for 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), all have low para fractions, but perhaps in the order of 4 <6 <2, because NO2 is a stronger EWG than COOH, which is stronger than COOEt. So, the para fraction would decrease as the EWG strength increases.

So, the order would be 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So the sequence is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. Looking at the options, this is option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, no. Option C says 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, but in my analysis, the next after 2 is 3 (Cl), then 1, then 5.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. Which would correspond to option C?

Wait, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. Hmm, no. Because according to my analysis, 3 (Cl) is after 2 and before 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction for Cl is higher than for COOEt and COOH but lower than for methyl and ethyl.

So, in terms of increasing order:

4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction.

Then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

Then comes 3 (Cl), which is ortho/para, but deactivating.

Then 1 (CH3), which is EDG, so higher para.

Then 5 (C2H5), EDG and bulky, so highest.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Hmm, no, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So in that case, 3 is last. But in my analysis, 3 comes before 1 and 5.

So perhaps my analysis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the directing effect for Cl is ortho/para, but the ring is less reactive, so the para fraction is lower than for activating groups.

So, for substituent 3 (Cl), the para fraction is moderate. Then, for activating groups (1,5), the para fractions are higher.

So, the order would be 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Which is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No. Option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. Hmm, perhaps the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each substituent's effect again.

Substance 4: NO2 is a strong EWG, meta director. So, para product is negligible → para fraction is very low.

Substance 6: COOH is a strong EWG, meta director. Para fraction is low but higher than NO2? Or lower?

Wait, stronger EWGs (like NO2) are more deactivating. So, the ring is less reactive, so substitution is less favorable, but the para fraction is based on where the substituent directs. Since both NO2 and COOH are meta directors, their para fractions are low, but perhaps NO2 leads to less para product than COOH.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: in the case of substituents that are meta directors, the para fraction is the same? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps all meta directors have para fractions that are lower than any ortho/para directors, but among themselves, their order depends on some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the para fractions for meta directors are all close to zero, so in the overall order, they come first. Then, the ortho/para directors follow, ordered based on their activating strength and bulk.

So, for the meta directors (2,4,6), their para fractions are low. So, the order among them could be based on the substituent's strength as an EWG. Stronger EWGs have lower para fractions.

So, nitro (4) is a stronger EWG than COOH (6), which is stronger than COOEt (2). So, the order would be 4 <6 <2. So, these three would be first.

Then, the ortho/para directors (3,1,5) follow. Among these, Cl is deactivating, so its para fraction is lower than activating groups.

So, Cl (3) has a lower para fraction than CH3 (1) and C2H5 (5). But between CH3 and C2H5, the ethyl group being bulkier leads to a higher para fraction.

So, the order for ortho/para directors would be 3 <1 <5.

Putting it all together, the overall order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which corresponds to option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3. Wait, no, because option C says 4<6<2<1<5<3. Wait, no, in the order I have, 3 comes after 2, so the order is 4,6,2,3,1,5.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No.

Option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of 2,6,4. Let me think again.

If 4 is the lowest, then 6, then 2, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So the correct order is 4<6<2<3<1<5.

Looking at the options, none of them match this. Oh wait, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, that's not matching. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, but why would 2 come after 4 and before 6? Because 2 is an ester group, which is less deactivating than nitro and carboxylic acid.

Wait, NO2 is a stronger EWG than COOEt, which is stronger than COOH? Hmm, no, COOH is a stronger EWG than esters. Because in carboxylic acids, the -COOH group has a stronger -I effect than esters.

So, the order of EWG strength is: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, their para fractions would be from lowest to highest: 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt).

So, the correct para fractions for meta directors are 4 <6 <2.

Then, the ortho/para directors: 3 (Cl) has lower para fraction than 1 (CH3), which is lower than 5 (C2H5).

So, the overall order: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options again, none of the options match this. Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, option C says 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, because after 2, it's 1, but according to my analysis, 3 (Cl) should come before 1.

So, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, which is not any of the options. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction for Cl is lower than for COOEt. So, after 4 <6 <2 comes 3, then 1, then 5.

Looking again at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, that's not correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4.

None of these exactly match my current understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial analysis is incorrect. Maybe for substituents that are meta directors, the para fraction is zero. So, the para fractions for 2,4,6 are zero, and thus they all come first, followed by the ortho/para directors in increasing order of their para fractions.

But then, the order would be 2,4,6 (all zero) followed by 3,1,5.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The correct answer is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about the activating or deactivating nature of the substituents and how that affects the para product.

So, activating groups (EDGs): increase reactivity, so para product is major. Deactivating groups (EWGs): decrease reactivity, but can still direct.

Substituents that are EDG and ortho/para directors: para product is major.

Substituents that are EWG and meta directors: para product is minor.

So, the order of increasing para fractions would be: meta directors (EWG) < ortho/para directors (EDG).

So, the order would be substances 2,4,6 (lowest para fractions) followed by 3,1,5 (increasing para fractions).

But the options don't have all three meta directors first.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So, the order would be 4 (NO2) <2 (COOEt) <6 (COOH) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Wait, this would suggest that 6 has a higher para fraction than 2, which doesn't make sense because COOH is a stronger EWG than COOEt, leading to lower para fractions.

So, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of substituent effects.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to approach this is to think about the meta directors: their para fractions are low, but among them, which has the lowest.

Nitro is the strongest EWG, so para fraction is the lowest.

Then, COOH is next, followed by COOEt.

So, 4 <6 <2.

Then, among the ortho/para directors, Cl is a deactivating group, so its para fraction is lower than the activating groups (CH3 and C2H5). So, 3 <1 <5.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But I don't think that's correct because 3 (Cl) should come before 1 and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm running out of time to think, so I'll make a best guess. The correct order is 4 (NO2) para fraction is the lowest, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 3 (Cl) as an ortho/para but deactivating, then 1 (CH3), and finally 5 (C2H5) as the highest.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option A.

The question involves determining the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for six benzene derivatives undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of the substituents and their influence on the formation of the para-isomer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Electron-donating groups (EDGs)** (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para directors and activating, leading to higher para fractions.
   - **Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** (e.g., -NO2, -COOH, -COOEt) are meta directors and deactivating, resulting in lower para fractions.
   - **Substituents like -Cl** are ortho/para directors but deactivating, leading to moderate para fractions.

2. **Relative Para Fractions**:
   - **Meta directors** (-NO2, -COOH, -COOEt) have low para fractions, with stronger EWGs (e.g., -NO2) having the lowest.
   - **Ortho/para directors** (-CH3, -C2H5) have higher para fractions, with bulkier groups (e.g., -C2H5) favoring para substitution more due to steric hindrance.
   - **-Cl** is an ortho/para director but deactivating, resulting in a moderate para fraction.

3. **Order of Increasing Para Fractions**:
   - **Lowest para fractions**: Substances 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOEt), with 4 < 6 < 2.
   - **Moderate para fraction**: Substance 3 (-Cl).
   - **Higher para fractions**: Substances 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5), with 5 > 1.

### Final Order:
The substances are arranged in increasing order of para fractions as follows:
**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.  
  Incorrect, as it places 2 before 6, which contradicts the stronger EWG nature of -COOH compared to -COOEt.
- **Option B**: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3.  
  Incorrect, as it places 4 (strongest EWG) after 6 and 2.
- **Option C**: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.  
  Incorrect, as it places 3 (moderate para fraction) after 1 and 5, which are ortho/para directors with higher para fractions.
- **Option D**: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4.  
  Incorrect, as it places meta directors (6, 2, 4) after ortho/para directors.

### Conclusion:
The correct order based on the analysis is **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**, but none of the options match this. The closest match is **Option A**, which is selected as the answer.
