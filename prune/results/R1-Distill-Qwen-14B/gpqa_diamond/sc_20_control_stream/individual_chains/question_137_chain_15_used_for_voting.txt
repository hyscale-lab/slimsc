Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, synchrocyclotron... I remember that's a type of particle accelerator. Right, cyclotrons use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a bit different because they have a varying magnetic field, I think. Or maybe it's the electric field that's varying? Oh wait, no, in cyclotrons the magnetic field is constant, and the particles spiral outwards as they gain energy. Synchrocyclotrons might have a different setup.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. Then it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the proton goes through two stages of acceleration, each providing some energy? Or perhaps it's about two different modes of acceleration within the synchrocyclotron?

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The initial phase Φ0 is π/4, and U0 is 190 kV. U0 is the amplitude of the voltage, right?

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. Revolutions would correspond to how many times the proton goes around the circular path in the accelerator before exiting or reaching the target energy.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution depends on the magnetic field. But synchrocyclotrons might have a different approach because the magnetic field varies to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. Oh right, the key is that the frequency of the voltage matches the natural cyclotron frequency of the particle as it gains energy. So the phase of the voltage is adjusted as the proton's speed increases, allowing it to keep accelerating each half-cycle.

The general formula for the number of revolutions is probably related to the energy gained and the accelerating voltage. But wait, let's think about the energy. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is related to the work done by the electric field. Each time the proton goes through a half-cycle of the voltage, it gains energy from the electric field.

Wait, protons are accelerated when the electric field is in the same direction as their motion. The voltage is oscillating, so the electric field alternates. The maximum energy gain would occur when the proton is accelerated during the peak of the voltage. But for each oscillation cycle, perhaps the proton can gain energy twice? Because in a cosine wave, the voltage is at maximum and minimum once per cycle.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated every time the electric field is in phase with their velocity. For a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is kept matched so that each time the particles go around, they get a kick from the electric field.

I think the number of revolutions is linked to the total energy gained. So the energy per revolution is the product of the charge, the voltage, and some factor, perhaps. Or maybe the energy per revolution depends on the voltage and the number of times it's accelerated.

Wait, the kinetic energy gained by the proton is equal to the integral of the electric field over the distance, but in this case, it's an oscillating electric field. Alternatively, the work done by the electric field would determine the energy gain.

The voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν t + Φ0]. So the electric field E is related to the gradient of the voltage, but perhaps more importantly, the energy gain per unit charge (ΔE = q ΔV) happens when the proton is accelerated through the voltage.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the particles move in a circular path, and the electric field is applied radially. So the potential difference they experience as they go around once is the voltage U(t). So each time they go around, they experience a varying potential.

Wait, but each time the proton completes a half-cycle, they gain energy. Or perhaps each full cycle allows for a certain amount of energy gain.

Let me think. The energy gained per revolution would be approximately the product of the charge, the voltage, and some factor. Since the voltage is oscillating, maybe the average energy gain per revolution is q * U0 / 2.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me try to recall the formula. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is given by the integral of the power over time, where power is F · v. But maybe a simpler approach exists.

Alternatively, for each half-cycle of the voltage, the proton is accelerated once. Since the voltage is sinusoidal, each time the voltage is at its maximum, the proton would gain a certain amount of energy.

Wait, another approach: the maximum energy gain per half-cycle is e * U0, but since the voltage is applied across the gap, the proton can gain energy e * U0 each time it's accelerated.

Wait, but the total energy is 950 MeV. Let's compute how much energy each half-cycle contributes.

The charge of the proton is e = 1.602×10^-19 coulombs.

So each maximum acceleration gives the proton e * U0. Wait, but wait. The voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the maximum voltage is U0, which is 190 kV. So each time the proton goes through a half-cycle (i.e., when the voltage is at peak), it gains e * U0.

Wait, but the voltage is applied alternately, so perhaps every time the electric field aligns with the proton's velocity, it gains e * U0. But how often does that happen?

Wait, the frequency of the voltage is ν. The phase is given, but the frequency is probably important here.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the natural frequency of the proton as it orbits. So the number of revolutions the proton makes would be related to the ratio of the total energy to the energy per revolution.

So, the total energy is T1 = 950 MeV.

Each revolution (or each half-revolution?) gives some energy. Let me think: the energy gain per revolution could be e * U0. But wait, maybe that's not correct because the voltage is applied in a way that the proton only gets a kick once per orbit.

Wait, perhaps each orbit, the proton gains e * U0. So the number of orbits N is T1/(e U0). But let me compute that.

First, compute e*U0 in MeV.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So e*U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = approximately 3.044e-14 joules. Convert that to electron volts:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 3.044e-14 J = 3.044e-14 / 1.602e-19 eV ≈ 1.9e5 eV = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

Wait, because U0 is 190 kV, so e*U0 is 190 keV. Which is 0.190 MeV.

So each revolution, the proton gains 0.190 MeV.

Wait, but the total energy to reach is 950 MeV. So the number of revolutions N would be 950 MeV / 0.190 MeV per revolution.

Wait, 950 / 0.19 is approximately 5000. Because 0.19 * 5000 = 950.

Wait, 0.19 * 5000 = 950, yes. So 5000 revolutions.

Looking at the options, option B is 5300, option C is 3536, option D is 2500. Hmm, none is exactly 5000. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution is not e U0, but something else. Because the actual energy gained per orbit might not be exactly e U0, but depends on the phase and how much of the voltage is applied each time.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Φ0). The initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So at t=0, the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707 U0.

But wait, the proton starts with negligible KE, so initially, its velocity is minimal, and the time for each orbit is very large. Wait, but as the proton gains energy, its velocity increases, so the time for each orbit decreases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν is adjusted to match the proton's cyclotron frequency as it moves.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the energy gained per revolution.

Wait, another approach: The kinetic energy T is related to the number of times the proton is accelerated. Each acceleration gives e U0. But wait, if the voltage is applied as a cosine, then the maximum energy transfer occurs when the voltage is at its peak. But to reach maximum efficiency, the voltage must be in phase with the proton's velocity each time it passes the gap.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find a formula or relationship.

In a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes. The voltage is applied in a way that the electric field is in phase with the particle's velocity as it passes through the gap.

The energy gained per revolution can be approximated as e U0, but perhaps the actual formula is a bit more involved.

Wait, another thought: the kinetic energy gained is equal to the integral of the work done by the electric field. So the power is F · v, and F = e E. So the power is e E · v.

The electric field E is related to the voltage gradient. But the voltage is changing with time, so it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the fact that the kinetic energy is the integral of the work done over time. The work done is the integral of F · dx, which for a force F in the direction of motion is F * distance. But since the electric field is changing, perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, the number of revolutions N can be calculated using the formula:

N ≈ (T) / (e U0) )

Wait, but earlier I did that and got N= 950 / 0.19 = 5000. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of two. Because each time the proton goes through a full cycle (two half-cycles), does it gain two times e U0? Or perhaps each half-cycle contributes e U0.

Wait, let me think again. The voltage U(t) is a cosine function, so it takes two time units to complete a cycle. Each time the voltage is at maximum, the proton is accelerated once. So perhaps every time the voltage is at a peak, the proton gains e U0.

But how many peaks are there per revolution? Because each revolution takes a certain time, but the number of peaks per revolution would be one per cycle of the voltage.

Wait, maybe not. The phase of the voltage is such that each time the proton completes a revolution, the voltage is at a phase that allows maximum acceleration.

Wait, but each time the proton completes a revolution, it is accelerated by the voltage once. So the number of times it is accelerated is equal to the number of revolutions.

Therefore, each revolution allows the proton to gain e U0 energy. So the number of revolutions N is T1/(e U0).

But wait, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and we need to reach 950 MeV.

So:

N = (950 MeV) / (e U0 in MeV)

As computed earlier, e U0 is 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So N = 950 / 0.19 = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest options are B)5300 and C)3536.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the voltage is applied twice per revolution. Wait, because the electric field changes direction each half-cycle, so perhaps the proton is accelerated twice per revolution? Or perhaps each revolution corresponds to two applications of the voltage.

Wait, for a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap. In a standard cyclotron, each time the particle goes around, it's accelerated once. But in a synchrocyclotron, because the magnetic field is adjusted, the frequency is kept matched, allowing acceleration each half-cycle.

Wait, actually, in a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the gap, it's accelerated once. So if the voltage completes a full cycle (two half-cycles) while the particle goes around once, perhaps each revolution allows two accelerations.

Wait, but that depends on whether the frequency of the voltage matches the rotation frequency. So if the voltage's frequency ν is twice the rotation frequency, then each revolution would have two peaks. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the number of revolutions N is:

N = (T1) / (e U0) ) * (gamma factor), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the energy gained per revolution is e U0. So N = T1/(e U0). So 950 MeV divided by 0.190 MeV per revolution is 5000. But the options don't have that. So maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is only half of that. Wait, the voltage is U0 cos(...), so the maximum is U0, but the average energy gain per revolution might be e * U0 / 2.

Wait, if the voltage alternates, then some of the time the particle is going against the electric field, which would decelerate it. Or perhaps the acceleration occurs only when the voltage is at a certain phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is e U0 times the cosine term's average.

Wait, maybe the energy per revolution is e U0 (1/2), because over a full cycle, the average value is zero, but the maximum is U0. So the energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is (e U0) multiplied by the number of times the voltage is applied per revolution.

Wait, this is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should look for a standard formula related to synchrocyclotrons.

Wait, I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by N = (E)/(e U0) ), where E is the kinetic energy. But I'm not certain.

But according to that, N would be 950 / (0.19) = 5000. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial phase plays a role. The phase Φ0 is π/4. So the voltage starts at 0.707 U0. So perhaps the first acceleration isn't at maximum. But over time, the phase is adjusted so that the maximum is achieved. So maybe the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions, just the timing.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is (E)/(e U0). Let me compute that.

E = 950 MeV

e U0 = 190 keV = 0.190 MeV

N = 950 / 0.190 = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is option B)5300, which is approximately 5000 but a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e U0. Let me double-check.

U0 = 190 kV = 190,000 V.

e U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190,000 V) = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = 3.0438e-14 J.

Convert to eV:

3.0438e-14 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = approx 1.9e5 eV = 190,000 eV = 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So that part is correct.

Thus, N=5000. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, maybe the formula isn't N = E/(e U0). Maybe it's N = (E)/(e U0) ) * (something). For example, if each revolution provides e U0/2, then N would be 950 / 0.095 = 10,000, which is not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial energy is not zero but negligible, and the first few accelerations are necessary. But that wouldn't change the total, I think.

Wait, perhaps there are two stages, as mentioned in the problem: the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, wait, the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So perhaps each acceleration provides a certain amount of energy.

Wait, but I'm not quite sure how that fits in. The problem says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV." Hmm. So maybe it goes through two stages of acceleration, each with some process.

Wait, perhaps each stage is a different mode of acceleration, but I'm not familiar with that. Or maybe it's a typo and it's two steps, but it's unclear.

Wait, another thought: in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field strength is varied to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the applied voltage frequency. The number of revolutions the proton makes is determined by the time it takes to reach the desired energy.

The energy gained is related to the number of times the proton has been accelerated, which depends on the number of times it has gone around the ring and the voltage has been applied.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions N is given by the equation:

N = (E) / (e U0) ) × (something else).

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Hmm, 5300 is close to 5000. Perhaps I made a miscalculation due to relativistic effects or something else. But the problem says the proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so maybe relativistic effects can be ignored. So the initial velocity is non-relativistic.

Wait, another approach: the cyclotron frequency is given by ω = (e B)/(m c), but in a synchrocyclotron, the B field varies to keep ω in sync with the applied voltage's frequency.

The time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(e B). But as B increases, T decreases.

Wait, but the energy gained per revolution would be e U0, so integrating over time would give N = E / (e U0).

But again, that brings me back to 5000.

Wait, perhaps the actual formula is N = (E)/(e U0) ) × (some factor), like 2, because each cycle gives two accelerations. Wait, if each revolution is accompanied by two acceleration events (each half-cycle), then N would be E / (e U0 / 2) ) = 2 E/(e U0).

So 2 * 5000 = 10,000. But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the ratio of the kinetic energy to the product of the charge and the voltage, but considering that the voltage is applied as a cosine.

Wait, perhaps the average energy gain per revolution is e U0 × (1/2), because the voltage is a cosine wave and the average is zero. But that can't be right because the voltage is being applied in a way that the maximum is achieved each time.

Wait, maybe the effective energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by the square of the amplitude or something else. I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the time it takes to reach the desired energy is the number of revolutions multiplied by the period of the voltage. So N × (1/ν) = (magnetic field's effect on the time per revolution)... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a formula or a standard result.

After some Googling in my memory, I recall that in a synchrocyclotron, the number of times the proton is accelerated is equal to the ratio of the final energy to the maximum energy per acceleration.

Each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains e U0. So if the final energy is E, the number of revolutions N is E/(e U0).

But in this case, E is 950 MeV and e U0 is 190 keV, so N is 950 / 0.19 = 5000. Still, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied twice per revolution, so the number of accelerations is 2N. Then the total energy would be 2N * e U0.

So 2N * e U0 = 950 MeV.

N = 950 / (2 * 0.19) = 950 / 0.38 = 2500.

Ah! 2500 is option D. So perhaps each revolution allows two accelerations, so the number of accelerations is twice the number of revolutions, hence N = E/(2 e U0).

That would give 950 MeV / (2 * 0.190 MeV) ) = 950 / 0.38 = 2500. So option D is 2500.

But wait, why would each revolution have two accelerations? Because in a cosine wave, the voltage reaches maximum twice per cycle (at π/2 and 3π/2?), but maybe the proton is accelerated twice per cycle.

Alternatively, each time the voltage reaches a peak, the proton gains energy. So if the voltage completes a full cycle (2π) while the proton goes around once, then in one revolution, the voltage goes through a full cycle, providing two opportunities for acceleration (each peak once). So each revolution gives two accelerations, each giving e U0, so 2 e U0 per revolution.

Wait, but that would double the energy per revolution. Then N would be E/(2 e U0).

Wait, but in that case, for E=950 MeV, N=950/(2*0.190)= 2500.

Which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase is π/4, so the first acceleration doesn't happen at the peak. But that shouldn't affect the total number, just the initial timing.

Wait, but the initial phase is π/4, which might mean that the first acceleration doesn't contribute the full e U0. But that would complicate things; perhaps the problem expects us to ignore that because the initial energy is negligible, and the majority of the accelerations occur when the voltage is at maximum.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (E)/(e U0) ) × (something related to the phase), but I don't know.

Given the options, the closest plausible answer would be 2500, option D. Because 950/(2 * 0.19)=2500. So I think the correct answer is D) 2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the relationship between the energy gained and the accelerating voltage. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and reaches a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied is given by \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   Each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains energy due to the electric field. The energy gained per revolution is approximately \(e U_0\), where \(e\) is the proton's charge. Converting \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) to energy in MeV:
   \[
   e U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 0.190 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Total Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total number of revolutions \(N\) is the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0}.
   \]
   Substituting \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(e U_0 = 0.190 \, \text{MeV}\):
   \[
   N = \frac{950}{0.190} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Adjustment for Voltage Application**:  
   The voltage is applied as a cosine wave, meaning the proton is effectively accelerated twice per revolution (once at each peak of the voltage). This implies that the total number of revolutions is halved:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{2 \cdot e U_0}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   N = \frac{950}{2 \cdot 0.190} = \frac{950}{0.38} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   The number of revolutions the proton makes is \(N = 2500\), which corresponds to option D.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron.
