Alright, let's try to solve this problem. Okay, so we have a system of three spins, each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So, first, I think I should figure out all the possible states of the system and calculate the energy for each.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Because for each state, the energy depends on the products of the spins.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

For each term, S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, or some other number.

Wait, let's see. Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me consider the possible number of pairs that are aligned (i.e., S_i S_j = +1) or anti-aligned. For three spins, each spin pairs with two others.

If all three spins are the same, say all +1 or all -1, then each product S_i S_j is +1. So sum is 3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

If two are same and one different, say two +1 and one -1. Let me pick a state, say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no: E is -J multiplied by that sum. So if the sum is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, but let me calculate for each state:

State 1: all +1.

E = -J*(1 +1 +1) = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

E = -J*( (1*1) + (1*-1) + (1*-1) ) = -J*(1 -1 -1) = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

E = -J*( (1*-1) + (1*1) + (-1*1) )= -J*( -1 +1 -1 ) = -J*(-1) = J.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=1.

Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

E = -J*(-1) = J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Same as state2, sum is 1-1-1=-1. E= J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State8: all -1.

Sum is 1 +1 +1 =3. E= -3J.

Wait, so all states where all spins are the same (states 1 and 8) have E=-3J.

All other states (states 2-7) have E= J.

So, how many states have E=-3J? Two: all up or all down.

And the other six states have E= J.

Wait, but wait: in each of the states 2-7, the sum is -1, so E= J. So each of them contributes exp(β J). Because E= J, so exp(-β E) = exp(-β J) ?

Wait wait, no. The energy is E = ... So in the partition function, it's exp( -β E ) multiplied by 1 for each state.

So for each state, the term is e^{- β E}.

So for the two states with E=-3J, the term is e^{3 β J}.

For the other six states, each has E= J, so term is e^{ - β J }.

So the partition function Z is sum of all these terms.

So Z = 2 * e^{3 β J} + 6 * e^{ - β J }.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option A: Z=2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ}

Option B: Z=2e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}

Option C: Z=2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ}

Option D: Z=6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ}

So the partition function I found is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which matches option B.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, in the two states with E=-3J, the energy is E=-3J, so in the exponent it's -β E = 3β J.

In the other six states, E= J, so exponent is -β J. So each of these contributes e^{- β J}.

So Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{- β J}.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins. Each state corresponds to a unique combination of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). For simplicity, we categorize the states based on their energy values rather than enumerating all 8 states individually.

### Step 2: Determine energy for each state
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), which can take the following values:
1. **All spins aligned**: \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \).  
   In this case, \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

2. **Two spins aligned, one spin opposite**: For example, \( S_1 = S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \).  
   Here, \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

There are two states with \( E = -3J \) (all spins aligned) and six states with \( E = J \) (two spins aligned, one spin opposite).

### Step 3: Calculate the partition function
The partition function is the sum over all states of \( e^{-\beta E} \). For the two states with \( E = -3J \), each contributes \( e^{3\beta J} \). For the six states with \( E = J \), each contributes \( e^{-\beta J} \). Thus:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect coefficients and exponents).

The correct answer is **Option B**.
