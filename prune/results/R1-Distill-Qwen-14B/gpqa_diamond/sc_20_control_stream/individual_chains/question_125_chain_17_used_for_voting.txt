Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kx, and in the potential, k would be mω².

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm, right, the third excited state. Wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy level, which is the first state. Then the first excited state is the next one up, second excited, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth energy level, right?

I remember that for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but because it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions. So the energy depends on the sum of these quantum numbers. Oh wait, no, actually, I think the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number. Wait, no, that's for one dimension. Oh right, wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħ ω. But because the oscillator is isotropic, states with the same sum of n_x, n_y, n_z have the same energy. So the energy levels are quantized in terms of the total quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Another approach: The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω, where n is the total number of quanta, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh, but n is a non-negative integer, starting from 0. So the ground state is n=0: E = (0 + 3/2) ħ ω. Then n=1: E=(1 + 3/2) ħ ω, which is (5/2) ħ ω, that's the first excited state. Then n=2: 7/2 hbar omega, second excited. n=3: third excited state would be E=(3 + 3/2) ħ ω? Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. So that's n=0, E = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state would have n=1, so E= (1 + 3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω. The second excited state is n=2, E=7/2 ħω. The third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 ħ ω. Oh wait, wait. No, maybe I'm getting confused about how the excited states are counted. Because the ground state is n=0, so the first excited state is n=1, second excited is n=2, third excited is n=3. So yes, the third excited state is n=3. So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, each energy level is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So, the ground state is n=0: 3/2. First excited: n=1 → 5/2. Second excited: n=2 →7/2. Third excited: n=3 →9/2. So the energy is (9/2) ħω. So looking at the options, option A and C have this energy, (9/2) ħω. So their energies match.

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, what's the degeneracy of the third excited state (n=3). The degeneracy is the number of distinct states (eigenfunctions) with the same energy. For a 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy is given by (n +1)(n +2)/2, or wait, is it (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers, n_x + n_y + n_z = n. That's a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1) )= (n+2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, it would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 =10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, so the third excited state is n=3, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So looking at the options, option A says 10. So option A's first part is (9/2) ħω, second part 10. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option C has the same energy but 3 eigenfunctions. So that would be incorrect. Option B and D have different energies, so they're out. So the correct choice is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy, which is determined by the number of ways to distribute \( n \) quanta among the three spatial dimensions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy of the Third Excited State**:
   - The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), with energy \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The first excited state corresponds to \( n = 1 \), with energy \( E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The second excited state corresponds to \( n = 2 \), with energy \( E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The third excited state corresponds to \( n = 3 \), with energy \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

2. **Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**:
   - The degeneracy is determined by the number of ways to distribute \( n = 3 \) quanta among the three dimensions, which is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the degeneracy is:
     \[
     \text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
     \]
   - For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is:
     \[
     \text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
     \]

3. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option A: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches both the energy and the degeneracy.
   - Option C: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \) has the correct energy but incorrect degeneracy.
   - Options B and D have incorrect energy expressions, so they are invalid.

### Conclusion:
The energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
