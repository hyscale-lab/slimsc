Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle and the allowed partial waves. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron, maybe) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. We're told that Pauli statistics require the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state to satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, wait, I think that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that equation again. It says T equals S plus L plus 1, all modulo 2. So T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Oh right, because Pauli's exclusion principle applies, and the total wavefunction must be anti-symmetric. So the product of the spatial, spin, and isospin parts must be anti-symmetric. The overall parity also comes into play because particle X has a certain parity.

The initial state is 1S0. So, in the term symbol notation, 2S+1 L J. Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So S is 0 (since 2S+1 is 1), which makes sense for a spin singlet. The L is 0, so it's an S state. And J is 0. So initial total angular momentum is 0.

When they emit particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1, the final state of the two nucleons must combine with X in a way that conserves parity and angular momentum. Also, the problem says to consider conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

The question asks which partial wave is not permitted. The options are different transitions: 1S0 → 7D1 + p, etc. Each option gives the initial and final state, and the type of particle emitted (p, s, f... which correspond to orbital angular momentum l=1,0,3? Wait, no. Wait, the letters are s, p, d, f, which correspond to l=0,1,2,3. So for example, particle X being emitted in a p state would have l=1.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0. So the initial orbital angular momentum L is 0. After emission, the NN system has some orbital angular momentum L', and the emitted particle X has angular momentum l. So the sum of L' and l must match the initial angular momentum. Wait, the initial total angular momentum is J=0.

But wait, the total angular momentum J is the vector sum of the orbital angular momentum (L), the spin (S), and the isospin (T) of the NN system. Wait, but in the initial state, since it's 1S0, the orbital angular momentum is L=0, and spin S=0 (because 2S+1=1 implies S=0). So initially, the NN system has J=0 (since J = L + S + T... no, wait, J is the sum of L, S, and T? Or is J the sum of the individual spins and orbital angular momentum? Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think.

Wait, in the term symbol, the J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L) and the total spin (S) of the nucleons. So initial state: L = 0, S = 0, so J = 0. After the emission, the NN system will have a new state with T, S, L, and thus a new J. But the total angular momentum in the final state must match the initial because of conservation. Oh wait, but the system is emitting a particle, so the total angular momentum should be the sum of the NN state's J and the X's angular momentum. But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me approach this step by step.

The main points I need to consider are:

1. Conservation of angular momentum: The initial angular momentum (J=0) must equal the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (J') and the emitted particle X's angular momentum (l). But wait, X has intrinsic angular momentum, which is its orbital angular momentum l. Wait, but particles like photons (but X is a nucleon? Or maybe a pion? Or some meson?) Hmm, but the problem says X is a particle emitted by the NN system. Let me think about the angular momentum.

Assuming that the emission is via a transition where the NN system changes its state, and a particle X is emitted. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final total angular momentum is J_initial = J_NN + L_X, where J_NN is the angular momentum of the new NN state and L_X is the angular momentum of X. But wait, no: in emission, the process must conserve total angular momentum. So J_initial (which is 0) must equal the vector sum of J_NN and L_X. But angular momentum is a vector, so we have to consider the possible values based on addition. Alternatively, perhaps the parity must also be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the parity. The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is 1. The parity of the final state must be the same, considering that the emitted particle X has parity -1.

Wait, the parity of the system after emission is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative. So parity_initial = 1 (since 1S0 has L=0). After emission, parity_final = (-1)^L_NN * (-1)^l_X * (-1)^{T_X} (Wait, no, particle X's parity is intrinsic. So I think the parity of the entire final state (NN + X) should equal the initial parity. Or wait, considering that the X is emitted, the parity would be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Hmm. Let me think.

The initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = 1.

The final state consists of the NN state (parity P_NN) and the emitted particle X (parity P_X = -1). So P_final = P_NN * P_X. But because the entire system's parity must be conserved (assuming no change in the overall parity of the system except for the emitted particle), so P_initial = P_final. So 1 = P_NN * (-1). Therefore, P_NN must be -1.

So the parity of the NN state after emission must be -1. Since the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_NN}, we have (-1)^{L_NN} = -1. Therefore, L_NN is odd. So L_NN must be 1, 3, etc. But looking at the options, the possible L_NN in the final states are D (L=2?), wait wait, no. Wait, the options give the final state as 7D1, 3S1, etc. Wait, the notation is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. Wait, the final NN state is given in the left part of the option. So for option A, it's 7D1. So their L is 2 because D is l=2. So parity of the NN state would be (-1)^2 = 1. But wait, earlier we concluded the NN state must have parity -1, so that would require L to be odd. So for option A, the final NN state has L=2 (even) → parity 1. Then the total parity would be 1 * (-1) = -1, which would not equal the initial parity of 1. So this would violate parity conservation. Hmm, but wait the initial parity is 1. So the product P_NN * P_X must equal 1. So if P_NN is parity of the NN state, then P_NN * (-1) = 1 → P_NN = -1. So the NN state must have parity -1. So the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L_NN = -1. So L_NN must be odd.

Looking at the options:

A) 7D1 → L=2 → parity 1 → which gives P_final = 1 * (-1) = -1. Which is not equal to initial parity 1. So this can't be allowed. So option A is invalid.

But wait, that's just parity. Let's check other options.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 → parity 1 → P_final = 1*(-1) =-1 → again, not 1. So this is also invalid. Hmm, but that's a problem because the initial parity is 1. So both A and B result in P_final = -1, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recap.

In the initial state, the NN system has parity P_initial = 1. After emission, the system consists of the NN state and the emitted particle X. So the total parity is P_NN * P_X. Because parity is multiplicative. So initial parity is 1. So 1 = P_NN * (-1), since X has parity -1. Therefore, P_NN must be -1.

So the parity of the NN state after emission must be -1, which implies that L_NN is odd. So L_NN is 1, 3, etc.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 3D3 → L=2 → parity 1. So again, P_final = 1*(-1)= -1. Not allowed.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 → parity (-1)^1 = -1. So P_final = (-1)*(-1) = 1, which matches the initial parity. So D is allowed.

Wait, but all the options except D have even L, making their parity 1, leading to P_final = -1, which is not allowed. So which of these options are possible?

Wait, but let me check each option's parity.

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 → parity 1. So P_final =1*(-1) = -1 → not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 → parity 1. P_final = -1 → not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2 → parity 1 → P_final = -1 → not allowed.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 → parity (-1)^1 = -1. P_final = (-1) * (-1) = 1 → allowed.

So according to the parity condition, only option D is allowed. But the question is which partial wave is NOT permitted. So all options except D would have wrong parity, but the question provides only four options. Wait, no, the question is about which is not permitted, so the wrong options are those where the parity is wrong. But earlier I thought that only D has correct parity, so the others would be forbidden. But the question is asking which partial wave is NOT permitted. So if all except D are forbidden, but the options are given, then the answer would be the one that doesn't satisfy the parity condition.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine.

The initial parity is 1.

After emission, the total parity is P_NN * P_X. So 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So P_NN = (-1)^L_NN = -1 → L_NN is odd.

So the final state must have L being odd. So D is the only option where L is odd (L=1, since it's P state). So all other options have even L, which would make P_NN = 1, leading to P_final = -1, which doesn't match initial parity. Therefore, options A, B, C would have the wrong parity and are forbidden. But the options are given as options for which partial wave is not allowed. So the question is, which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct forbidden ones would be A, B, and C. But the options don't have that. Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p → final L=2 (D state)

B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p → final L=0 (S state)

C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f → final L=2 (D state)

D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s → final L=1 (P state)

So only D has L=1 (P state) which is allowed for parity. The others have L=0,2, which are even, making P_NN positive, leading to P_final -1, which is not allowed. Thus, the options A, B, C are not permitted. But the question is about which is not permitted, so the correct answer would be each of A, B, C is forbidden, but the question's options are presented as four choices, and the answer is the one that is not allowed. So the problem is asking which one is not permitted. So the correct answer is that options A, B, C are not permitted. But the question is phrased as which of the following is not permitted. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the angular momentum conservation. Because the initial state has J=0, and the final state's total angular momentum must also be zero. So J_initial = J_final. Let's calculate J for each option.

The initial state's J is 0.

The final total angular momentum is the sum of the NN state's J and the emitted X's angular momentum, which is l. But wait, no: when a system emits a particle, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J=0 must equal the vector sum of the final NN's J' and the X's angular momentum. But the emitted particle X's angular momentum is l, which is an integer (0,1,2,..) and its direction can vary. So to find allowed transitions, we can consider that the initial J (0) must be matched by the possible J' and l such that they can sum to zero.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible values of J' and l. Since initial J=0, the final J' and l must satisfy J' = l, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the vector sum, so J_initial = J_NN + L_X. But since J_initial is 0, J_NN and L_X must be equal and opposite vectors. Which is only possible if J_NN = L_X, and they are in opposite directions. But since J_NN and L_X are both non-negative integers, the only possibility is J_NN = L_X and they add vectorially to zero. So J_NN must equal L_X, and their directions opposite, which only happens if J_NN = L_X =0. But that's not possible for any of the options except perhaps D? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular momentum can only be conserved if the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l is equal to the change in the NN system's L. The initial L is 0, and the final L is L_NN. So the change in L is L_NN - 0 = L_NN. The emitted particle X must have orbital angular momentum l such that L_NN = l, because angular momentum is conserved. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because orbital angular momentum can be in any direction. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of possible L and l combinations that can lead to initial L=0.

Wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is L=0. After emission, the NN has L_NN, and X has l. So the vector sum of L_NN and l must equal the initial L, which is 0. So L_NN + l = 0 vectorially. Which is only possible if L_NN = l and they are in opposite directions, but since L_NN and l are magnitudes, not vectors, this isn't possible except when both are 0. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Another approach: the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the NN system has L. The initial orbital angular momentum is 0. So the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L + l. But since the initial is 0, we have L + l =0, which is only possible if L = l = 0. But that can't be right because the options have higher L and l.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the initial orbital angular momentum is 0, and the final state's orbital angular momentum is the sum of the NN's L and the X's l. But the initial and final must have the same orbital angular momentum. Wait no, because the X is emitted, taking away some angular momentum. So the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the NN's L and X's l must be zero. That is, L_NN + l = 0. Since L_NN and l are non-negative integers, the only possibility is L_NN = l = 0. But looking at the options, the emitted particles have l=1 (p), l=0 (s), etc. So this can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be based on the conservation of total angular momentum, which includes both the orbital and spin parts. But I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to focus back on the parity condition. Earlier, I concluded that only option D has the correct parity because it has L=1 (odd), leading to P_NN=-1, so P_final=1, which matches the initial parity. So the other options (A, B, C) have L even, leading to P_NN=1, making P_final = -1, which doesn't match initial parity.

So the partial waves not permitted would be those where the parity doesn't match. Among the options, all except D have even L and thus would lead to P_final=-1, which is wrong.

But the question is which partial wave is NOT permitted. So the forbidden ones are A, B, and C. But the options only have four choices, with each option representing a possible transition. So the question is which of these four is not allowed. So the correct answer would be the options that don't satisfy the parity condition.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the Pauli statistics equation they provided: T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

The final state has T=0. So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

In the initial state, the two nucleons are in a spin singlet (S=0) and L=0. After emission, the NN state will have a new S' and L'. We need to ensure that the Pauli condition holds.

Looking at each option:

Option D: Final state is 3P0. So the term symbol is 3P0. Breaking that down: 3=2S+1 → S=1. P is L=1. J=0. So S=1, L=1.

Now, T must be 0. So according to the condition, T = S + L +1 mod 2.

S=1, L=1 → 1+1 = 2 → 2 mod 2 = 0. So T = 0 + 1 → 1 mod 2. But the final T is given as 0. So this would require 1 ≡ 0 mod 2, which is false. So this can't be allowed. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Because earlier, based on parity, option D seems allowed, but based on the Pauli condition, it's not allowed.

Wait, let me recalculate. The Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T = (S + L + 1) mod 2. Given T=0, so 0 = (S + L + 1) mod 2 → S + L +1 ≡ 0 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd.

In option D: S=1, L=1 → 1 +1=2 → even. So 2 mod 2=0. So 0≡1? No. So this option doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So it's not allowed.

But earlier, the parity condition suggested that option D is allowed. So which one is correct?

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine this.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition applies to the emitted particle's quantum numbers. Or maybe I'm getting the quantum numbers wrong.

Wait, the problem states: "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

So for the final NN state, T, S, L.

So for option D: T=0, S=1, L=1.

So T = 0 = (1 + 1 + 1) mod 2 → 3 mod 2 is 1 → 0 ≠ 1. So condition not satisfied. Thus, option D is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought parity allowed option D. So now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step for each option.

Let's list each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p → final NN state is 7D1. The term symbol: 7=2S+1 → S=3. D → L=2. J=1.

So for final state, S=3, L=2, T=0.

Check Pauli condition: T = (S + L +1) mod 2 → 0 = (3 +2 +1) mod 2 →6 mod 2 =0 → 0=0 → condition holds.

Now check parity: initial parity is 1. X is a p particle, which has l=1 (p has l=1, so parity of X is (-1)^1 = -1). The parity of the NN state is (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = 1. So total parity: 1 * (-1) = -1. But initial parity is 1 → this doesn't match. So parity not conserved. So option A is forbidden.

Option B: 3S1 + p → final state is 3S1. Term symbol: 3 → S=1, L=0, J=1.

Check Pauli condition: T=0 = (1 +0 +1) mod 2 → 2 mod 2=0 → 0=0 → condition holds.

Parity: NN state L=0 → parity 1. X is p → l=1 → parity -1. So total parity is 1*(-1) =-1. Doesn't match initial 1 → forbidden.

Option C: 3D3 + f → final state is 3D3. 3=2S+1 → S=1. D→ L=2. J=3.

Pauli condition: T=0 = (1 +2 +1) mod 2 → 4 mod 2=0 → condition holds.

Parity: NN state L=2 → parity 1. X is f → l=3 → parity (-1)^3 =-1. So total parity is 1*(-1) =-1. Doesn't match initial 1 → forbidden.

Option D: 3P0 → final state is 3P0. 3=2S+1 → S=1. P→ L=1. J=0.

Pauli condition: T=0 = (1 +1 +1) mod 2 → 3 mod 2=1 → 0≠1 → condition not satisfied. So option D is forbidden.

Wait, so all options are forbidden? But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Pauli condition.

The Pauli condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

So for option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1+1=3 → mod 2 →1. So T must be 1. But the problem states that T(NN)=0. So this condition is not met. Thus, option D is forbidden.

But earlier, I thought that the parity condition allowed only option D. But according to the Pauli condition, option D is forbidden.

So now I'm really confused. Let me go back and make sure I'm applying the conditions correctly.

Wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So for the final state, T must equal (S + L +1) mod 2.

In all options, let's compute (S + L +1) mod 2 and see if it equals T.

But T is given as 0. So we need (S + L +1) mod 2 to equal 0.

So (S + L +1) ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So for each option, check if S + L is odd.

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → odd → condition holds. So T=0= (3+2 +1) mod 2 → 6 mod 2=0 → condition holds. But parity is wrong.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → odd → condition holds. But parity is wrong.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 1+2=3 → odd → condition holds. But parity is wrong.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → even → condition not met. Thus, option D is forbidden.

So according to the Pauli condition, only option D is forbidden. But earlier, the parity condition forbids A, B, C.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. How can that be?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me read the problem statement again.

The question says: Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So for each option, compute T = S + L +1 mod 2. If T is 0, then (S + L +1) must be even.

But in all options except D, the condition holds. Let me calculate:

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2+1=6 → even → T=0 correct.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0+1=2 → even → T=0 correct.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →1+2+1=4 → even → T=0 correct.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →1+1+1=3 → odd → T=1 ≠0 → condition not met. So D is forbidden.

So Pauli condition allows A, B, C but forbids D.

But the parity condition requires that the NN state has L odd, which is only D. So in A, B, C, the L_NN is even, leading to P_NN=1, which when multiplied by X's parity (-1) gives P_final= -1, which doesn't match initial parity=1. So those options are forbidden by parity.

Only D has L=1 (odd), leading to P_NN=-1, so P_final= (-1)*(-1)=1, which matches. But according to Pauli condition, D's T would be 1, but the problem says T=0. So D is forbidden.

So this is a paradox. Both conditions are not satisfied by any options. But the problem states that the final state has T=0, so perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbols.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the term symbols. Let me re-examine each option's final state:

Option A: 7D1 → 7=2S+1 → S=3. D→ L=2. J=1.

Option B: 3S1 → 3=2S+1 → S=1. S→ L=0. J=1.

Option C: 3D3 → S=1. L=2. J=3.

Option D: 3P0 → 3=2S+1 → S=1. L=1. J=0.

So for each option, compute (S + L +1) mod 2:

A: 3+2+1=6 →0.

B:1+0+1=2→0.

C:1+2+1=4→0.

D:1+1+1=3→1.

So D is the only option where T would be 1, but the problem states T=0. So D is forbidden due to Pauli condition.

But the parity condition says that only D has correct parity. So which is more important? Both conditions must be satisfied.

So option D would violate the Pauli condition but satisfy the parity. The other options satisfy Pauli but violate parity.

But the problem asks which is not permitted. So we're looking for the option that doesn't satisfy any of the conditions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that both conditions must be satisfied. So the correct option must satisfy both parity and Pauli conditions. Let's see:

Only option A: S=3, L=2 → S + L =5 → odd → condition holds. Parity: L=2 → P_NN=1 → P_final= -1 → doesn't match initial. So it's forbidden.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → S+L=1 → condition holds. Parity: P_NN=1 → P_final=-1 → forbidden.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → S+L=3 → condition holds. Parity: P_NN=1 → P_final=-1 → forbidden.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → even → condition not met. Parity: correct → P_final=1.

So which is more important? Both conditions must be met. So the only option that meets both is none, but that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the Pauli condition. Wait, the problem says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

Wait, perhaps T, S, L are vectors, but I'm treating them as scalars. Or perhaps the sum is S·L or something else. But the problem states it as T = S + L +1 mod 2. So it's a scalar equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the term symbols.

Wait, another approach: the parity of the NN state after emission must be -1. So L must be odd. So the only possible option is D, which has L=1. But Pauli condition forbids D.

So perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, let me re-calculate the Pauli condition for option D. S=1, L=1. So S + L +1=1+1+1=3 → 3 mod 2=1. So T=1, but the problem states T=0. So condition not met. So D is forbidden.

But according to parity, D is the only allowed option. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity calculation. Let me re-examine that.

The initial parity is 1. The final parity is P_NN * P_X. X has parity -1, so P_final= P_NN * (-1). To have P_final=1, P_NN must be -1. So (-1)^L_NN =-1 → L_NN must be odd. So only D has L=1.

But according to the Pauli condition, D is forbidden.

So the only conclusion is that option D is allowed by parity but forbidden by Pauli condition, making it impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is that all options are forbidden, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the emitted particle's spin and isospin are also involved. But the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1, but nothing about spin or isospin. So perhaps I should only consider the orbital angular momentum and parity.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to find the correct answer.

The question is: which partial wave is not permitted (i.e., which option is forbidden).

From parity: Only D has L=1 (odd), so P_NN=-1 → P_final=1, which is allowed. So parity permits D. But Pauli condition requires T=0, but for D, T=1. So Pauli forbids D.

Thus, D is forbidden.

But earlier I thought that the parity condition allows D, but the Pauli condition forbids it. So the correct answer is D is forbidden.

But let me check the options again. The question is which is not permitted due to conservation laws.

So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions of parity conservation and the Pauli exclusion principle. The initial state is a 1S0 state, which has angular momentum \( J = 0 \), orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \), and spin \( S = 0 \). The intrinsic parity of the initial state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = 1 \). After the emission of particle \( X \), the final state of the NN system must satisfy both parity conservation and the Pauli condition \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), where \( T \) is the isospin of the final NN state, \( S \) is the total spin, and \( L \) is the orbital angular momentum.

   - The parity of the final state is given by \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \), where \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^L \) is the parity of the NN state and \( P_X = (-1)^l \) is the parity of the emitted particle \( X \), with \( l \) being the orbital angular momentum of \( X \).
   - Since \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \), we must have \( P_{\text{final}} = 1 \). Given \( P_X = -1 \), this implies \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \). Therefore, \( (-1)^L = -1 \), meaning \( L \) must be odd.

2. **Pauli Condition**:
   - The Pauli condition \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) must be satisfied for the final NN state. Since \( T = 0 \), this implies \( S + L + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), or equivalently, \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Thus, \( S + L \) must be odd.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( 7D1 \), where \( S = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)) and \( L = 2 \) (from \( D \)).  
  - Parity: \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^2 = 1 \), so \( P_{\text{final}} = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match the initial parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), so \( T = 0 \).  
  - **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

- **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( 3S1 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L = 0 \) (from \( S \)).  
  - Parity: \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^0 = 1 \), so \( P_{\text{final}} = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match the initial parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), so \( T = 0 \).  
  - **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

- **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( 3D3 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L = 2 \) (from \( D \)).  
  - Parity: \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^2 = 1 \), so \( P_{\text{final}} = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match the initial parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), so \( T = 0 \).  
  - **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

- **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
  - The final NN state is \( 3P0 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L = 1 \) (from \( P \)).  
  - Parity: \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^1 = -1 \), so \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1) \cdot (-1) = 1 \), which matches the initial parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), so \( T = 1 \), which does not match the given \( T = 0 \).  
  - **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to Pauli condition violation.

### Final Answer:
The only partial wave that satisfies both parity conservation and the Pauli condition is **none** of the options. However, based on the analysis, **Option D** is the most restrictive and violates the Pauli condition.
