Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says. 

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The chemist has provided Mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D. 

So, starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and a peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular ion is the molecular weight, right? So the molecular formula would have a molecular weight of 156. The 158 peak is probably an isotope. Let me think, chlorinated compounds often show a molecular ion and a chlorine isotope peak. Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and about 25% for 37Cl. So the molecular ion would be M and M+2. Let me calculate the possible isotopic pattern.

If the molecular formula has one Cl atom, then the molecular ion would appear at M and M+2. The abundance ratio would be approximately 3:1, because for each Cl atom, the chance of a 37Cl is 25%, so the M+2 peak would be about 25% of M? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio of the molecular ion peaks depends on the number of Cl atoms. Let's think: for one Cl, the molecular ion would be at m/z = molecular weight (with 35Cl) and m/z +2 (with 37Cl). The abundance would be 75% for M and 25% for M+2. Alternatively, if there are two Cl atoms, the M and M+2 would be more prominent, with the ratio being 9:6:1 for two Cl atoms because each Cl contributes a 35 and 37, so possible combinations. But in this case, the peaks are at 156 (100%) and 158 (32%). So 32% is about a third of 100%, which suggests maybe one Cl atom because 25% is close to a third. Wait, but 32 is roughly 25% multiplied by 4, no. Alternatively, maybe another isotope effect. Or perhaps the molecular formula has one Cl. So molecular weight is 156, which includes Cl (atomic weight ~35.5). So 156 - 35.5 is about 120.5 for the rest of the molecule.

Looking at the IR data: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually suggest O-H or N-H stretches. But since we're dealing with a solid, and the options are organic, it's more likely an O-H stretch. A broad peak around 3500 suggests a hydroxyl group, possibly in a carboxylic acid (which has a broad O-H stretch) or maybe an alcohol. But looking at the options, let's see:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. Option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which would have a phenolic O-H. Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which is another carboxylic acid. Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester, O-CO-O, but I think chloroformate esters might have different functional groups.

The IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1, but when deprotonated, it can be a bit higher. Wait, but in the pure acid form, the carbonyl in the IR would be in that region. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is around 1740-1720. Wait, no, actually, esters are a bit higher, around 1740. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700, maybe a little higher. Esters are around 1740, maybe. But wait, sometimes if the acid is in a different environment, it could be a bit higher. Then, looking at the NMR.

The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a strong singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes if it's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR, the OH proton is usually a broad peak or not observed if it's exchanging. Wait, but in the data given, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet. So perhaps it's not an -OH, but another type of proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm, but maybe in some cases, like para-substituted, it could be a bit higher. Or perhaps it's a ketone? No, because ketones don't have protons. Or maybe an acidic proton, like in a phenol. But then the peak would be broad, wouldn't it? Hmm.

Wait, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet, which suggests no neighboring protons. So maybe it's a carbonyl group attached to something else. Wait, another possibility: a meta-directing group. Alternatively, the 11 ppm could be a carbonyl oxygen adjacent proton, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H, with coupling between the two sets. So the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. 

Looking at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl in position 4, COOH in position 1 (since benzoic acid is position 1). So the substituents are Cl and COOH, which are meta to each other? Wait, no, 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl at position 4 relative to COOH at position 1. Wait, but that's not possible because positions 1 and 4 are across the ring. Oh wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So 4-chloro would be para to COOH? Hmm, but the COOH is a strong deactivating group, so the Cl would be in the para position. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the ring has substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the NMR for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH would be in position 1, Cl in position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents (COOH and Cl) are in positions 1 and 4, so the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4, so the remaining positions 2,3,5,6. But in that case, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, but in the NMR, the peaks are for 2H each, which suggests that the ring has two sets of two equivalent protons. So perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, making the ring have two doublets each with 2H.

Wait, let me think. If the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons across from each other are equivalent. So, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is in position 1, Cl in position 4. The ring protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, COOH is a strong deactivating group, so the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. In such a case, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each of these would show as a doublet. Wait, but wait, in para substitution, perhaps the coupling is between the two sets. So, for example, the H in position 2 would couple with H in position 6, and H in position 3 would couple with H in position 5. But in the NMR, each set is a doublet. So in the case of para substituents, the aromatic protons would show as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the given data. 

So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each 2H. But wait, what about the substituents? The COOH group is in position 1, Cl in position 4. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the 2,6 protons would be one doublet, and 3,5 another.

So the NMR would have two doublets, each 2H. That matches the data.

Looking back at the 1H NMR data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So the higher field doublet is at 7.72, and the lower is at 8.02. That suggests that the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups which deshield the protons. The more deshielded protons (higher ppm) are likely closer to the substituent. 

Wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH group is in position 1, and Cl in position 4. The protons adjacent (ortho) to COOH would be positions 2 and 6, which are closer to the electron-withdrawing COOH group. Those protons should be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the para positions. So the 2,6 protons would be more deshielded than 3,5. So in the NMR, the 2,6 protons would be the higher ppm doublet. So 8.02 corresponds to 2 and 6, and 7.72 corresponds to 3 and 5.

Now, the 11.0 ppm peak. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the COOH proton would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR data given, the 11.0 is a singlet, not a broad peak. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is not deprotonated in the solution, so the -OH appears as a broad peak, but in the given NMR, perhaps it's not observed, or perhaps in the data provided, it's the aldehyde proton.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl in position 3, OH in position 2, and an aldehyde group in position 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because numbering for benzaldehyde would have the aldehyde in position 1. So in 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde, the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). That would have a para-substituted ring? No, it's meta?

Wait, let's draw the structure. Benzaldehyde has the aldehyde group in position 1. Then, 2-hydroxy would be in position 2, and 3-chloro in position 3. So positions 1,2,3 are substituted. That would make the ring have three substituents. The NMR would have more complex splitting. Let's see: if the substituents are in positions 1,2,3, the aromatic ring would have three substituents, leading to more complex coupling patterns. The given NMR only shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests only two substituents on the ring. So option A might not fit, because it has three substituents.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That would be OCl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure is ClCO-O-Ph. Wait, no. Chloroformate esters have the structure R-O-CO-Cl. So phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no, more accurately, it's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituents on the benzene would be the OCOCl group. So the benzene would have one substituent, a OCOCl group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group.

In the NMR, phenyl chloroformate would have a singlet for the aromatic protons if they're all equivalent, but that's not the case. Wait, if the substituent is in a position that makes the ring para-substituted, but wait, the substituent is one group, so the ring would be mono-substituted. So the aromatic protons would be a triplet perhaps, but in mono-substitution, the ring protons would be split into a pattern with two doublets.

Wait, no, mono-substituted benzene rings have a more complex splitting. For example, if the substituent is in position 1, the ring protons in positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, and position 4 is unique. But in the NMR, the data shows two sets of 2H, suggesting that the substituent is in a position that makes the ring have two sets of equivalent protons. That's more likely with a para-substituted ring, which is two substituents opposite each other. But phenyl chloroformate has only one substituent, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H, so that suggests the ring has two substituents in para positions. So phenyl chloroformate has only one substituent, which would not produce this pattern. So option C might not fit.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So the substituents are COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the ring has substituents in adjacent positions, which would cause the aromatic protons to have a different splitting pattern. Let's see: in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is position 1, Cl is position 2. The ring protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent due to symmetry? Or not? Wait, the substituents are in positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), which are adjacent. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2, making the ring have an ortho substitution. The protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But in that case, the substituents are adjacent, so the ring would not have mirror symmetry, leading to more complex splitting. The NMR would show more than two doublets. So the given NMR data of two doublets each 2H suggests substituents in para positions, so option D might not fit.

Wait, but let's think about the possibility of the 11.0 ppm peak. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, but in the data presented, the 11.0 is a singlet. So maybe that's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol, as in option A, which would have a phenolic O-H. But phenolic O-H is usually broad as well. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 11.0 ppm is not an O-H but another type of proton. Let me think. Another possibility is an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but can be higher if the aldehyde is in an electron-deficient environment. So if the aldehyde is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like in a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents that pull electrons, the aldehyde proton could be upfield or downfield. Wait, actually, if there's an electron-withdrawing group, like Cl, in the ortho position, the aldehyde proton might be deshielded and appear downfield. But 11 ppm seems a bit high for an aldehyde.

Alternatively, the 11.0 ppm could be a carbonyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like in an ester or acid. But wait, no, carbonyls are C=O; they don't have protons attached. So perhaps the 11.0 is a hydroxyl group, but not a broad peak. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe the 11.0 ppm is an exchangeable proton that's not observed because of rapid exchange, but sometimes in DMSO or certain solvents, the -OH peak can appear as a sharp singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an -OH but another group.

Wait, going back to the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156. The molecular formula would then have a molecular weight of around 156. Let's calculate the possible formula.

Assuming the formula is C8H7ClO2: let's calculate the molecular weight. C=12, H=1, Cl=35.5, O=16.

So 8*12 = 96, 7*1=7, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. Adding up: 96 +7=103; 103+35.5=138.5; 138.5+32=170.5. That's way over 156.

Wait, let me think again. The molecular ion is 156. Let's see the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, 2*16=32. So 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Close enough, considering rounding. So the molecular weight is approximately 156.5, which would match the molecular ion at 156 (if considering that the exact mass might round to 156). So that's a match.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B: C7H5ClO2, same molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as B and D. But the structure would be different.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular weight for option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So phenyl group is C6H5, chloroformate is ClCOO. So the formula would be C6H5ClCOO? Wait, that's C7H6ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 6=6, Cl=35.5, 2*16=32. So 84+6=90, 90+35.5=125.5, +32=157.5. So molecular ion would be 158, but the given molecular ion is 156. So option C's molecular weight is about 157.5, which doesn't match the mass spec. So option C is probably not the right answer.

So between options A, B, D. All have molecular weight around 156.5, which would give a molecular ion at around 156 or 157. The mass spec has a peak at 156 (100%) and 158 (32%). Wait, 158 is about 156 +2. Hmm, but if the molecular formula has one Cl, the M+2 would be due to Cl's isotopes. So the M peak is at 156, M+2 at 158. So the abundance ratio would be roughly 3:1. Because for each Cl atom, 75% of the time it's 35Cl (so M appears at 156), and 25% 37Cl (so M+2 at 158). So the ratio should be approximately 156:158 ~ 3:1. But the data shows 156 is 100%, 158 is 32%. Wait, 32% is about a quarter. So 156 is 100%, and 158 is 25% (since 100% is the base peak), but in the data it's 32%. Hmm, this might be a bit confusing. Maybe the molecular formula has two Cl atoms. Let me check the options.

Options B and D have one Cl each. Option A has one Cl. Option C has one Cl. Wait, but if the molecular formula has two Cl atoms, the M and M+2 would have a ratio that reflects the possible combinations. For two Cl atoms, the possible isotope peaks would be M (two 35Cl), M+2 (two 37Cl, but that's 37Cl is about 25% abundance, so the chance is (0.25)^2 = 6.25%, so M+2 would be about 6% of the base. Also, there's M and M+4, but that's more complicated. But our data shows a M+2 at 32%, which is 1/3 of M. That doesn't fit with one Cl or two Cls. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula doesn't have Cl. Let me think, but that's unlikely because all the options have Cl except maybe option C, but I thought C's formula was C7H6ClO2, which would have Cl. No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula has bromine? But the options don't include bromine. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is something else.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C8H6ClO2? Let's compute: 8*12=96, 6=6, Cl=35.5, 2*16=32. Total = 96+6=102+35.5=137.5+32=169.5. That's too high. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C9H10ClO2? No, that's likely over.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2 (like options B and D). Then molecular weight is 156.5. So the M is at 156.5, which would round to 157. But the data shows M at 156. Hmm, perhaps the exact mass is such that 156 is the correct mass. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is different. Let's think about the options again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2? Let's compute: 8*12=96, 7=7, Cl=35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 96+7=103, +35.5=138.5, +32=170.5. That's too high; the molecular ion is at 156.

Wait, perhaps option C is not a fit because the molecular weight doesn't match. So focusing back on options B and D.

Now, the IR: a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1, but if it's a deprotonated acid (as in the solid form), maybe the carbonyl is a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is around 1740. Wait, but 1720 is in the middle. So if the substance is a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but perhaps in a different environment it's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride, but the options don't include that.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl around 1700. But the given IR has 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, could it be an ester? But the options don't have that. Wait, option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. The carbonyl in an ester is usually around 1740. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit lower. Maybe in this case, the substituents are causing a downshift. But then, the NMR doesn't fit, as discussed earlier.

Another thought: the broad peak in the IR from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Benzoic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3500. So that's consistent with options B and D.

Now, the NMR data: 11.0 ppm singlet (1H). If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, but in the data it's a singlet. Unless the -OH is exchanged and appears as a sharp peak, which can happen under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would have a phenolic O-H. Phenolic O-H protons are usually broad and appear around 9-12 ppm. But in the given NMR, it's a singlet at 11.0. So perhaps that's the O-H. But why is it a singlet? Because the O-H is exchange broadened, but in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is not observed, and the 11.0 is another proton.

Wait, another possibility: the 11.0 ppm is an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high, but possible if it's in a strongly deshielded environment.

Looking again at option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzene ring with -CHO in position 1, -OH in position 2, and Cl in position 3. The aromatic protons would be positions 4,5,6. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: benzaldehyde is position 1. 2-hydroxy would be position 2. 3-chloro would be position 3. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3. That would leave positions 4,5,6 with H's, but in this case, the ring would have three substituents, leading to more complex splitting than just two doublets. So the NMR data given would not match option A because the aromatic region would have more than two sets of protons.

So, going back to options B and D. Both are benzoic acids with Cl in different positions. So their NMR would differ in the aromatic region.

In option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6, with substituents at 1 and 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The coupling would be J around 8-9 Hz.

In the given data, the two doublets are at 8.02 ppm (J ~?) and 7.72 ppm. The higher ppm (8.02) would be more deshielded, so those protons are closer to the substituents. Since COOH is a stronger deactivating group than Cl, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm. So in option B, the 2 and 6 protons would be at higher ppm, appearing as a doublet at around 8.02. The 3 and 5 protons, which are meta to COOH and para to Cl, would be less deshielded and appear at lower ppm, around 7.72.

So that fits the NMR data.

But then, what about the 11.0 ppm peak? If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak. However, in the NMR data, the 11.0 is a singlet. That seems contradictory. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is not observed because it's under the solvent peak or due to exchange. Or perhaps the data is such that the O-H is not showing because it's a salt or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the 11.0 ppm is the aldehyde proton in option A. But as discussed, option A's NMR doesn't fit the aromatic data. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, let's think about option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The substituents are in positions 1 and 2. The protons at 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. Protons at 4 and 6 would be para to COOH and meta to Cl. But the splitting would be more complex because the substituents are adjacent. The aromatic protons might not split into just two doublets. So the given NMR data suggests two doublets, which would more likely be para-substituted, as in option B.

So putting it all together:

- Mass spec: M = 156, M+2=158. Fits with one Cl, so molecular formula likely C7H5ClO2. Options B and D fit.

- IR: Broad peak around 3500 (O-H, likely carboxylic acid), strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl).

- NMR: Aromatic protons as two doublets (para substitution), 11.0 ppm singlet (possibly O-H, but in data it's a singlet, which is confusing, but perhaps in the problem it's not an -OH).

Wait, but in benzoic acid, the O-H is a broad peak. If in the NMR, the 11.0 is a sharp singlet, perhaps it's not the O-H. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is not observed, such as in the case of a deprotonated acid (like the sodium salt), but the problem states it's a white solid, which could be the acid itself.

Alternatively, the 11.0 ppm peak might not be an O-H. Let me think, could it be another group? Maybe an aldehyde. If the compound were something like benzaldehyde derivative, but the IR has a strong carbonyl which would be the aldehyde. However, the IR also has a broad peak, which would suggest O-H.

Wait, but the 11.0 ppm is a singlet. Maybe it's a carbonyl group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenolic O-H, but why is it a singlet?

Wait, in option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The O-H would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but the data shows a sharp singlet at 11.0. That seems contradictory. Unless the O-H is not present, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the 11.0 ppm is not an O-H. Let me think about the molecular formula again. The molecular formula for option B is C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is 156.5.

If the 11.0 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different functional group.

Wait, another thought: the 11.0 ppm could be an NH group, but the options don't have amines. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR data again: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). The integration is 1H, so it's a single proton. That could be a carbonyl group, but in that case, it's not attached to a proton. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid, but again, the O-H is usually broad.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: 156.5 → M at 156. Fits.

- IR: O-H (broad), C=O (around 1700-1720). The given IR is 1720, which could be a bit high for a carboxylic acid, but possible.

- NMR: Two doublets for aromatic protons (matches para substitution). The O-H would be a broad peak, but in the data it's a singlet. However, perhaps in the given data, the O-H is not observed, or perhaps it's present as a singlet due to deuterated solvent or being a sharp peak. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement has a mistake, but I have to work with the given data.

Option B's structure would have a COOH group and a Cl in para positions, leading to two sets of aromatic protons as observed.

Alternatively, option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: same as B.

- IR: same.

- NMR: The aromatic protons would not split into two doublets because substituents are adjacent, leading to more complex splitting. So the given NMR doesn't fit option D.

So based on the NMR data, option B seems more likely, despite the confusion about the 11.0 ppm peak.

Wait, perhaps the 11.0 ppm is the O-H of the carboxylic acid. But why is it a singlet? Because it's exchanging rapidly, the peak could appear as a singlet in some cases. Alternatively, in certain conditions or with certain solvents, the O-H might appear as a sharp peak. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Considering all the data, the most consistent answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The key spectral information provided includes:

   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)**.  
   The molecular weight is approximately 156, and the M+2 peak at 32% suggests the presence of one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ~75% for ³⁵Cl and ~25% for ³⁷Cl). This aligns with a molecular formula of **C₇H₅ClO₂**, which corresponds to a molecular weight of ~156.5.

2. **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**:  
   - A **broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
   - A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, consistent with a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.

3. **Proton NMR (¹H NMR)**:  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A sharp singlet integrating to 1H, which could correspond to an O-H proton of a carboxylic acid.  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
  This compound has three substituents on the benzene ring (CHO, OH, and Cl), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR. The given NMR data shows only two doublets, which does not match the expected pattern for this structure.  

- **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
  This compound has a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4. The aromatic protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 would split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with the para-substitution pattern observed in the NMR. The broad O-H stretch in the IR and the sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm in the NMR are also consistent with the carboxylic acid functionality.  

- **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
  This compound has a single substituent (OCOCl) on the benzene ring, which would not produce the two doublets observed in the NMR. Additionally, the molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₆ClO₂) is ~157.5, which does not match the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156.  

- **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
  This compound has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 2. The substituents are adjacent (ortho), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR. The given NMR data does not match this expected pattern.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, particularly the NMR and IR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight, isotopic pattern, and functional group assignments all align with this structure.
