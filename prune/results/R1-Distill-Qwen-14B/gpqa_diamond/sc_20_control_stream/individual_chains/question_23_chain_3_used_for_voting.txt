Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. The question involves a reaction with hydrogen bromide (HBr) and a specific compound. Hmm, I need to figure out the products formed.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Wait, let me draw that structure in my mind. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group. Breaking that down: the butenyl chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4, I think, because it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but that's butenyl. Let me correct that: the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Or wait, no. But-3-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but in this case it's but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if starting from the attached end). So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, because but has four carbons, so numbering starts from the point of attachment. Let's see: for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, no. Let's number from the point where the oxygen is attached. So the first carbon is attached to O, then the next is carbon 2, then 3. Wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but that can't be because butenyl would have four carbons. So the structure is: the oxygen is connected to a CH2, then another CH2, then a CH, which is double bonded to the next CH2. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3? Wait, no, but that's confusing.

Wait, but the structure is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group has a double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is:

O
|
CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2-CH(CH2-CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps not. Let me think. The but-3-en-1-yl group is:

The first carbon is attached to the oxygen. Then the second is CH2, the third is CH2, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, so the structure is:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, making it CH2CH2CH=CH2, but that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain. So it's:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure becomes O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, but wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So on the second carbon (from the O), there are two methyl groups. So the structure is:

O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, because the but-3-en-1-yl group has four carbons, with the double bond starting at C3. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me try again. The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl chain is:

CH2 (attached to O) - C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2?

Wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that would be longer than four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should think of but-3-en-1-yl as:

Carbon 1 (attached to O): CH2. Carbon 2: CH2. Carbon 3: CH. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But this molecule is 2,2-dimethyl, so on carbon 2, there are two methyl groups. So the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2?

Wait, that can't be right because the butenyl chain is four carbons. Let me count again: the four carbons are attached to the O as 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. So 1: CH2-O. 2: CH2. 3: CH. 4: CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, no, but-3-enyl would have the double bond between 3 and 4, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But with 2,2-dimethyl, the second carbon (the second CH2) would have two methyl groups attached. So CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2? But that's five carbons. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—no, the butenyl group is four carbons. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.

The but-3-en-1-yl group is:

Position 1: attached to O. So O-CH2- (position 1). Position 2: next, so another CH2. Position 3: then a CH connected to position 4, which is CH2. But wait, but the double bond is between 3 and 4, so positions 3 and 4 are CH2 and CH2 in a single bond, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4? So O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 becomes O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, that's but-3-en-1-yl. But the group is 2,2-dimethyl, meaning on the second carbon (the second CH2) there are two methyl groups. So O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, but that would have a five-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but no, that's pentyl. Wait, maybe I should think of the group as:

The main chain is four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4 (so but-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So that would be O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, meaning on the second carbon (the second CH2), there are two methyl groups. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. That makes sense. So the structure is:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 (but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons), so O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 would become O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that would make the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So it's an allyl group attached to a substituted carbon.

So the starting material is a benzene ring with an ether group, which is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but actually with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, so O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 becomes O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the third and fourth. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, which are positions 3 and 4 from the point of attachment. So the actual structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2? Wait, that's five carbons. No, wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So the correct structure must be four carbons with the substituents.

Another approach: the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group has four carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 3 (from the point of attachment). So the first carbon is attached to O, the second has two methyl groups, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4.

So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth. Wait, but that would require the third and fourth to be CH2 and CH2. So maybe it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't involve a double bond. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should move on and think about the reaction.

The reaction is with hydrogen bromide (HBr). So the starting material is an ether with a substituted allyl group attached to the benzene ring. HBr is a typical reagent for allylic bromination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr could cause an acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps leading to an SN2 reaction or some kind of substitution.

Wait, but in ethers, the leaving group is poor unless activated. HBr is a strong acid and a source of Br-. So if the ether group is activated in some way, perhaps it could undergo nucleophilic substitution. But wait, the group attached to the oxygen is a butenyl group with substituents. If the oxygen is a good leaving group, but ethers are generally not susceptible to nucleophilic substitution unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, HBr could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But maybe another pathway is more plausible.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed ether cleavage. But that usually requires more vigorous conditions, like with H2SO4 and heat. HBr might not be sufficient for that. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: allylic bromination. The starting material has an allyl group attached to the benzene ring (since the butenyl group is attached via an ether). So the allyl group (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond) could undergo allylic bromination. This is a reaction where a bromine atom adds to the allylic position, which is the position adjacent to a double bond.

In allylic bromination, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the double bond is replaced by a bromine. This reaction typically occurs via a radical mechanism, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be an addition-elimination mechanism, maybe involving carbocation intermediates.

Wait, but HBr is a source of H+ and Br-. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed process where the allyl group forms a carbocation, which is then attacked by Br-.

Wait, but the butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, no, maybe I should give up trying to draw it and think about the possible products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Reacting with HBr. The TLC shows that the reactant spot is diminished, and two new spots have formed. So the reaction is not complete, but two products have formed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: two phenols. So perhaps the ether has been hydrolyzed. But HBr is a Lewis acid, not a strong base or nucleophile. Hydrolysis of ethers typically requires strong acid or base. Maybe with HBr, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr could be acting as a brominating agent, not as a hydrolyzing agent. So I'm not sure if this is the case. Also, the two products are 2- and 4-substituted phenols, but the starting material is an ether, so hydrolysis would give a phenol and an alcohol. But the starting material's substituent is an ether, O-R. So hydrolysis would produce phenol and R-OH. But in the options, both products are phenols, which might not make sense unless two different positions are being substituted. Hmm.

Option B: two substituted benzenes. One is 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy benzene, and another is a different butenyl group. Wait, perhaps the reaction led to bromination at the benzene ring or substitution in the butenyl group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring substitution, but the starting material isn't activated for that.

Option C: two bicyclic compounds. 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and another dihydrobenzofuran. Chromane is a benzene ring fused to a cyclohexane. Trimethyl suggests substituents. Dihydrobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused to a dihydrofuran ring. I'm not sure how HBr would lead to these structures. Maybe via some kind of cyclization, but I don't see how.

Option D: two bromo-substituted benzenes. Each with bromo and 2,2-dimethylbutoxy groups at different positions, like 4-bromo and 3-bromo. Wait, but the starting material is a mono-substituted ether. So how would two bromines get added?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The reaction is with HBr. Maybe the ether is undergoing substitution, with the oxygen leaving and Br- attacking. But ethers are generally poor substrates for SN2 reactions because the oxygen is not a great leaving group, unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, if the molecule can form a good leaving group upon protonation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. HBr could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group (H2O), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the butenyl group could undergo addition.

Wait, the butenyl group is an allyl group. So HBr could add across the double bond in an addition reaction. Since the starting material is an ether, the butenyl group is attached via an ether linkage. So if HBr adds to the double bond, it would form a bromoalkane. But in what way?

Alternatively, the HBr could cause a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not the case here. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But the starting material is an ether, and Friedel-Crafts requires an alkyl halide. Wait, no, HBr is present. Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3. But HBr is a source of H+ and Br-.

Alternatively, maybe the butenyl group is being brominated. For example, allylic bromination. So the HBr could be adding a bromine at the allylic position, leading to a bromo-substituted product.

Wait, but the starting material is an ether with an allyl group. So if the allyl group undergoes allylic bromination, the Br would add to the allylic position. Let's say that the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the allylic positions are C2 and C5 (but in a four-carbon chain, maybe only C2 and C4 are possible). Wait, but in but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the allylic positions are the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. So in this case, the allylic positions would be the CH2 groups on either side of the double bond.

So, in the butenyl group, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. The allylic positions are the two CH2 groups attached to the double bond (the CH2 in position 2 and the CH2 in position 4). So adding Br at position 3 (wait, no, but butenyl is four carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4.

If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the allylic positions are C2 and C4. So the Br could add to C2 or C4.

But the starting material also has two methyl groups on C2. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me correct that. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2? No, wait, no, but the butenyl is four carbons.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. The reaction with HBr could lead to substitution of the ether oxygen with Br. But in that case, the product would be a bromide. Alternatively, HBr could cause the formation of a bromoalkane via addition to the double bond.

Wait, but if the double bond is in the butenyl group, HBr could add across the double bond. So the double bond O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 would become O-CH2-CH2-CHBr-CH3 (if H adds to one end, Br to the other). But would that happen in this case?

Alternatively, the reaction could proceed via an acid-catalyzed mechanism where the double bond undergoes protonation, leading to addition of HBr. So the double bond (CH2-CH2-CH=CH2) would be protonated, then HBr adds across it.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be a substitution on the benzene ring, but the starting material isn't activated enough for that without a catalyst.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So the first product has a bromo substituent on the butenyl group. The second product has a different butenyl group. Hmm.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So two products, each with a bromo substituent on the butenyl group, but at different positions. If the reaction is allylic bromination, perhaps adding Br to different positions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene, and HBr adds across the double bond, it would form a bromide. But how many products would that form? Well, adding HBr to but-3-en-1-yl would lead to two possible products depending on where the H and Br add. Because the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr could give either 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol or 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The butenyl group is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the reaction possibilities.

Wait, if the reaction is adding HBr across the double bond, then the double bond would open up, and the product would be a bromide. So for but-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr would give either 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol or 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol? Or perhaps 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol and 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol. But wait, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the addition of HBr would form a bromide at C3 or C4.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but substitution. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So one product has a bromo group on the butenyl chain, and the other has a different structure, perhaps with a new double bond.

Hmm. Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening, but I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: when ethers react with HBr, sometimes they undergo cleavage, especially under acidic conditions. But for that, the ether needs to be activated, like having adjacent leaving groups. I don't think that's the case here. So perhaps the reaction is cleavage of the ether, leading to two products: a phenol and an alkyl bromide.

But looking at option A, the products are two phenols. So that would require the ether to break into two phenol groups, which doesn't make sense unless there are two benzene rings. But the starting material only has one benzene ring. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: two substituted benzene rings, each with a different substituent. Hmm.

Option C: two bicyclic structures. Maybe via some kind of cyclization, but I'm not sure how HBr would induce that.

Option D: two bromo-substituted benzene rings, each with the bromo group in a different position on the butenyl chain.

Wait, but the starting molecule is a single substituent on the benzene. So if the reaction is substitution on the butenyl group, perhaps multiple substitution positions are possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration, but that's not clear.

Another angle: the starting material has a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, but that would make the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

When HBr is added, the possible reaction is either addition across the double bond or substitution.

If it's addition, then the product would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3. But wait, that would be if H adds to one end and Br to the other, but that would lead to a specific stereochemistry. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond could shift, leading to a more stable carbocation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a bromination at the allylic position. So the Br would add to the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

In the case of O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the allylic positions are the CH2 groups attached to the double bond. So the allylic positions are the CH2-C(CH3)2 and the CH2-CH2 groups. Wait, maybe not. The allylic position is any carbon adjacent to the double bond. So in the butenyl group, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the allylic positions are C2 and C4. But in the starting structure, the butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. The allylic positions are C2 and C4. So the Br could add to C2 or C4.

Wait, but C4 is a terminal CH2, so it's only attached to one carbon. So perhaps bromination occurs at C2.

Wait, but the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the butenyl group is:

O-CH2- C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2?

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Let me try again. The correct IUPAC name is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So but-3-en-1-yl is:

1: CH2-O-

2: CH2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

But with a double bond between 3 and 4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, so on carbon 2, which is the second CH2, there are two methyl groups. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the structure is:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2

So the butenyl group is attached via an ether linkage. Now, when HBr is added, what could happen?

If the reaction involves allylic bromination, then the Br would be added to one of the allylic positions. In this case, the allylic positions are the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. Looking at the structure, the double bond is between CH=CH2. So the allylic positions are the CH2-C(CH3)2 and the CH2-CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps the allylic positions are the CH2-C(CH3)2 and the CH2 in the double bond.

Wait, maybe the bromine could add to the carbon next to the double bond, which is C2 (the CH2-C(CH3)2) or C4 (the CH2 in CH=CH2). But adding Br to C4 would be at the end, perhaps leading to a more stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a more stable carbocation. If the butenyl group is protonated, leading to a carbocation, which could then be attacked by Br-.

Wait, in the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, then adding HBr could lead to either 3-bromide or 4-bromide addition, but perhaps the more stable carbocation would form at the more substituted position.

Wait, the double bond is CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So when HBr adds across the double bond, the possible products are (from acid catalysis):

Protonation of the double bond would occur at the less substituted end, leading to the formation of a more stable carbocation.

So in this case, the double bond is CH=CH2. Protonation could occur on either end.

If H adds to the CH2 end (the end with more substituents), the carbocation would form on the adjacent carbon, which is already substituted with methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between CH2-C(CH3)2 and CH2-CH2. Let me think again. The structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the double bond is between the third and fourth carbons. The third carbon is attached to C(CH3)2, and the fourth is CH2.

If the double bond is protonated on the less substituted end (the fourth carbon, CH2), then the carbocation would form on the third carbon, which is attached to C(CH3)2. That's a tertiary carbocation, which is very stable.

Alternatively, if the proton adds to the third carbon (which is attached to C(CH3)2), the carbocation would form on the fourth carbon (CH2), which is less stable, a secondary carbocation.

So the more favorable pathway is protonation leading to the tertiary carbocation.

Then, Br- would attack the carbocation, leading to substitution at that position.

Wait, but the starting material is an ether, so the carbocation would be on the butenyl group, not on the benzene ring. So the bromide would add to the butenyl chain.

So the product would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2.

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, the addition could lead to O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution of the ether oxygen. But again, ethers are generally unreactive unless under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the HBr is causing the ether to undergo cleavage. But under what conditions? Acidic conditions might lead to cleavage, but I'm not sure if HBr alone is enough. Alternatively, HBr could act as a nucleophile, attacking the ether oxygen.

Wait, but the ether oxygen is a poor leaving group. Maybe the H+ from HBr protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group (H2O). Then, Br- could attack the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution. But that would require the structure to allow for such a substitution, perhaps in an SN2 mechanism.

But in the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the neighboring carbon (after the oxygen) is a CH2 group. So if the oxygen leaves as H2O, the Br could attack the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution. But that would require that the carbon is a good enough leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring substitution, but the benzene ring is not activated for electrophilic substitution under HBr conditions.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both products have bromo substituents on the butenyl group, but at different positions (3 and 4). So perhaps bromination occurred at two different positions on the butenyl group, leading to two products.

Alternatively, the reaction could involve bromide adding to different positions on the butenyl group, such as the 3rd and 4th carbons.

If the initial reaction adds Br to the 3rd carbon, making the product (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, and if another addition occurs at the 4th carbon, making (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, then option D would be the answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the starting material and the possible products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Upon reaction with HBr, the possible products are either substitution of the ether oxygen with Br, addition across the double bond, or bromination at the allylic position.

If the reaction is substitution of the ether oxygen, the product would be a bromide. But the options don't show that.

If the reaction is addition of HBr across the double bond, the product would have an added Br and H. But again, the options don't directly show that.

If the reaction is allylic bromination, adding Br to the allylic position, then two possible products could form, depending on where the Br adds.

Looking back, the starting material's butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The allylic positions are the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. So the possible positions are the CH2 attached to C(CH3)2 (position 2) and the CH2 attached to the double bond (position 4).

Wait, but position 4 is CH2, which is at the end of the chain. So bromination at position 4 would lead to a product like (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Similarly, bromination at position 3 (if possible) would give another product.

Wait, but the starting structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the possible positions for allylic bromination are C2 and C4. So adding Br to C2 would give (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene? Or wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, the butenyl group is four carbons:

1: O-CH2-

2: C(CH3)2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

But the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the allylic positions are C2 (next to C3) and C4 (next to C3? No, C4 is connected to C3 via a double bond, so the allylic positions are C2 and C4.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to number the carbons accurately.

The butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the structure is:

1: O-CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

But with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

But in the starting material, it's 2,2-dimethyl; so on carbon 2 (the second CH2), there are two methyl groups. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the four carbons are:

1: O-CH2-

2: C(CH3)2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

Double bond is between C3 and C4.

So the allylic positions are the carbons adjacent to the double bond, which are C2 and C4.

So adding Br at C2 would give a product where Br is on the C2, which is attached to two methyl groups. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-Br-CH=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the Br would add to C4, making O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CHBr.

Wait, but that's substitution in the butenyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding Br at the allylic position, leading to either the 3-bromo or 4-bromo product.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would directly relate to the options. Looking at option D, the products are 4-bromo and 3-bromo.

Wait, perhaps the original structure allows for bromination at two different positions, leading to both 3-bromo and 4-bromo products.

So if the reaction is allylic bromination, the Br could add to either C3 or C4, leading to two products. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a carbocation at C3, leading to Br addition there. But I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that option D is the correct answer. Because it shows two bromo-substituted products, each with Br at different positions on the butenyl group. This would happen if the reaction leads to bromination at two different allylic positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but a rearrangement leading to different structures. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the starting material is an ether with a substituent that can undergo acid-catalyzed reactions. HBr could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent carbon (CH2) could undergo nucleophilic attack by Br-, leading to substitution.

In that case, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, but that's not one of the options. So that line of thought might be incorrect.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening, but I don't see how that would fit the options.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible option is that the reaction leads to substitution at two different positions on the butenyl group, leading to products as described in option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The starting material, (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene, is an ether with a butenyl group attached to a benzene ring. The butenyl group has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and two methyl groups on carbon 2. The reaction with hydrogen bromide (HBr) likely involves allylic bromination, where bromine is added to the carbons adjacent to the double bond (allylic positions).

### Key Analysis of the Reaction
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, and the allylic positions are carbons 2 and 4.

2. **Reaction with HBr**:  
   HBr can act as a source of Br- ions, which can brominate the allylic positions. This reaction typically occurs via a radical or carbocation mechanism, leading to bromination at the allylic carbons.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - Bromination at carbon 3 (a tertiary position due to the methyl groups) would yield (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.  
   - Bromination at carbon 4 (a secondary position) would yield (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.  
   These two products are consistent with the observation of two new spots in the TLC.

### Evaluation of the Options
- **Option A**: Suggests the formation of two phenols, which is unlikely because the reaction conditions (HBr) do not favor ether cleavage to phenols.  
- **Option B**: Proposes two products, one with a bromine at position 4 and another with a modified butenyl group. This does not align with the expected allylic bromination products.  
- **Option C**: Suggests the formation of bicyclic compounds, which is not supported by the reaction conditions or the structure of the starting material.  
- **Option D**: Indicates the formation of two brominated products, (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which matches the expected outcome of allylic bromination at positions 3 and 4.

### Conclusion
The reaction with HBr leads to allylic bromination at positions 3 and 4 of the butenyl group, resulting in the two products described in **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. The question involves a reaction with hydrogen bromide (HBr) and a specific compound. Hmm, I need to figure out the products formed.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Wait, let me draw that structure in my mind. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group. Breaking that down: the butenyl chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4, I think, because it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but that's butenyl. Let me correct that: the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Or wait, no. But-3-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but in this case it's but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if starting from the attached end). So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, because but has four carbons, so numbering starts from the point of attachment. Let's see: for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, no. Let's number from the point where the oxygen is attached. So the first carbon is attached to O, then the next is carbon 2, then 3. Wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but that can't be because butenyl would have four carbons. So the structure is: the oxygen is connected to a CH2, then another CH2, then a CH, which is double bonded to the next CH2. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3? Wait, no, but that's confusing.

Wait, but the structure is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group has a double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is:

O
|
CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2-CH(CH2-CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps not. Let me think. The but-3-en-1-yl group is:

The first carbon is attached to the oxygen. Then the second is CH2, the third is CH2, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, so the structure is:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, making it CH2CH2CH=CH2, but that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain. So it's:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure becomes O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, but wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So on the second carbon (from the O), there are two methyl groups. So the structure is:

O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, because the but-3-en-1-yl group has four carbons, with the double bond starting at C3. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me try again. The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl chain is:

CH2 (attached to O) - C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2?

Wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that would be longer than four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should think of but-3-en-1-yl as:

Carbon 1 (attached to O): CH2. Carbon 2: CH2. Carbon 3: CH. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But this molecule is 2,2-dimethyl, so on carbon 2, there are two methyl groups. So the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2?

Wait, that can't be right because the butenyl chain is four carbons. Let me count again: the four carbons are attached to the O as 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. So 1: CH2-O. 2: CH2. 3: CH. 4: CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, no, but-3-enyl would have the double bond between 3 and 4, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But with 2,2-dimethyl, the second carbon (the second CH2) would have two methyl groups attached. So CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2? But that's five carbons. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—no, the butenyl group is four carbons. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.

The but-3-en-1-yl group is:

Position 1: attached to O. So O-CH2- (position 1). Position 2: next, so another CH2. Position 3: then a CH connected to position 4, which is CH2. But wait, but the double bond is between 3 and 4, so positions 3 and 4 are CH2 and CH2 in a single bond, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4? So O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 becomes O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, that's but-3-en-1-yl. But the group is 2,2-dimethyl, meaning on the second carbon (the second CH2) there are two methyl groups. So O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, but that would have a five-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but no, that's pentyl. Wait, maybe I should think of the group as:

The main chain is four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4 (so but-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So that would be O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, meaning on the second carbon (the second CH2), there are two methyl groups. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. That makes sense. So the structure is:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 (but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons), so O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 would become O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that would make the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So it's an allyl group attached to a substituted carbon.

So the starting material is a benzene ring with an ether group, which is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but actually with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, so O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 becomes O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the third and fourth. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, which are positions 3 and 4 from the point of attachment. So the actual structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2? Wait, that's five carbons. No, wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So the correct structure must be four carbons with the substituents.

Another approach: the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group has four carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 3 (from the point of attachment). So the first carbon is attached to O, the second has two methyl groups, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4.

So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth. Wait, but that would require the third and fourth to be CH2 and CH2. So maybe it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't involve a double bond. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should move on and think about the reaction.

The reaction is with hydrogen bromide (HBr). So the starting material is an ether with a substituted allyl group attached to the benzene ring. HBr is a typical reagent for allylic bromination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr could cause an acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps leading to an SN2 reaction or some kind of substitution.

Wait, but in ethers, the leaving group is poor unless activated. HBr is a strong acid and a source of Br-. So if the ether group is activated in some way, perhaps it could undergo nucleophilic substitution. But wait, the group attached to the oxygen is a butenyl group with substituents. If the oxygen is a good leaving group, but ethers are generally not susceptible to nucleophilic substitution unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, HBr could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But maybe another pathway is more plausible.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed ether cleavage. But that usually requires more vigorous conditions, like with H2SO4 and heat. HBr might not be sufficient for that. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: allylic bromination. The starting material has an allyl group attached to the benzene ring (since the butenyl group is attached via an ether). So the allyl group (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond) could undergo allylic bromination. This is a reaction where a bromine atom adds to the allylic position, which is the position adjacent to a double bond.

In allylic bromination, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the double bond is replaced by a bromine. This reaction typically occurs via a radical mechanism, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be an addition-elimination mechanism, maybe involving carbocation intermediates.

Wait, but HBr is a source of H+ and Br-. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed process where the allyl group forms a carbocation, which is then attacked by Br-.

Wait, but the butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, no, maybe I should give up trying to draw it and think about the possible products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Reacting with HBr. The TLC shows that the reactant spot is diminished, and two new spots have formed. So the reaction is not complete, but two products have formed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: two phenols. So perhaps the ether has been hydrolyzed. But HBr is a Lewis acid, not a strong base or nucleophile. Hydrolysis of ethers typically requires strong acid or base. Maybe with HBr, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr could be acting as a brominating agent, not as a hydrolyzing agent. So I'm not sure if this is the case. Also, the two products are 2- and 4-substituted phenols, but the starting material is an ether, so hydrolysis would give a phenol and an alcohol. But the starting material's substituent is an ether, O-R. So hydrolysis would produce phenol and R-OH. But in the options, both products are phenols, which might not make sense unless two different positions are being substituted. Hmm.

Option B: two substituted benzenes. One is 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy benzene, and another is a different butenyl group. Wait, perhaps the reaction led to bromination at the benzene ring or substitution in the butenyl group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring substitution, but the starting material isn't activated for that.

Option C: two bicyclic compounds. 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and another dihydrobenzofuran. Chromane is a benzene ring fused to a cyclohexane. Trimethyl suggests substituents. Dihydrobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused to a dihydrofuran ring. I'm not sure how HBr would lead to these structures. Maybe via some kind of cyclization, but I don't see how.

Option D: two bromo-substituted benzenes. Each with bromo and 2,2-dimethylbutoxy groups at different positions, like 4-bromo and 3-bromo. Wait, but the starting material is a mono-substituted ether. So how would two bromines get added?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The reaction is with HBr. Maybe the ether is undergoing substitution, with the oxygen leaving and Br- attacking. But ethers are generally poor substrates for SN2 reactions because the oxygen is not a great leaving group, unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, if the molecule can form a good leaving group upon protonation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. HBr could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group (H2O), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the butenyl group could undergo addition.

Wait, the butenyl group is an allyl group. So HBr could add across the double bond in an addition reaction. Since the starting material is an ether, the butenyl group is attached via an ether linkage. So if HBr adds to the double bond, it would form a bromoalkane. But in what way?

Alternatively, the HBr could cause a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not the case here. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But the starting material is an ether, and Friedel-Crafts requires an alkyl halide. Wait, no, HBr is present. Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3. But HBr is a source of H+ and Br-.

Alternatively, maybe the butenyl group is being brominated. For example, allylic bromination. So the HBr could be adding a bromine at the allylic position, leading to a bromo-substituted product.

Wait, but the starting material is an ether with an allyl group. So if the allyl group undergoes allylic bromination, the Br would add to the allylic position. Let's say that the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the allylic positions are C2 and C5 (but in a four-carbon chain, maybe only C2 and C4 are possible). Wait, but in but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the allylic positions are the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. So in this case, the allylic positions would be the CH2 groups on either side of the double bond.

So, in the butenyl group, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. The allylic positions are the two CH2 groups attached to the double bond (the CH2 in position 2 and the CH2 in position 4). So adding Br at position 3 (wait, no, but butenyl is four carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4.

If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the allylic positions are C2 and C4. So the Br could add to C2 or C4.

But the starting material also has two methyl groups on C2. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me correct that. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2? No, wait, no, but the butenyl is four carbons.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. The reaction with HBr could lead to substitution of the ether oxygen with Br. But in that case, the product would be a bromide. Alternatively, HBr could cause the formation of a bromoalkane via addition to the double bond.

Wait, but if the double bond is in the butenyl group, HBr could add across the double bond. So the double bond O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 would become O-CH2-CH2-CHBr-CH3 (if H adds to one end, Br to the other). But would that happen in this case?

Alternatively, the reaction could proceed via an acid-catalyzed mechanism where the double bond undergoes protonation, leading to addition of HBr. So the double bond (CH2-CH2-CH=CH2) would be protonated, then HBr adds across it.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be a substitution on the benzene ring, but the starting material isn't activated enough for that without a catalyst.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So the first product has a bromo substituent on the butenyl group. The second product has a different butenyl group. Hmm.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So two products, each with a bromo substituent on the butenyl group, but at different positions. If the reaction is allylic bromination, perhaps adding Br to different positions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene, and HBr adds across the double bond, it would form a bromide. But how many products would that form? Well, adding HBr to but-3-en-1-yl would lead to two possible products depending on where the H and Br add. Because the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr could give either 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol or 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The butenyl group is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the reaction possibilities.

Wait, if the reaction is adding HBr across the double bond, then the double bond would open up, and the product would be a bromide. So for but-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr would give either 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol or 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol? Or perhaps 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol and 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol. But wait, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the addition of HBr would form a bromide at C3 or C4.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but substitution. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So one product has a bromo group on the butenyl chain, and the other has a different structure, perhaps with a new double bond.

Hmm. Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening, but I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: when ethers react with HBr, sometimes they undergo cleavage, especially under acidic conditions. But for that, the ether needs to be activated, like having adjacent leaving groups. I don't think that's the case here. So perhaps the reaction is cleavage of the ether, leading to two products: a phenol and an alkyl bromide.

But looking at option A, the products are two phenols. So that would require the ether to break into two phenol groups, which doesn't make sense unless there are two benzene rings. But the starting material only has one benzene ring. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: two substituted benzene rings, each with a different substituent. Hmm.

Option C: two bicyclic structures. Maybe via some kind of cyclization, but I'm not sure how HBr would induce that.

Option D: two bromo-substituted benzene rings, each with the bromo group in a different position on the butenyl chain.

Wait, but the starting molecule is a single substituent on the benzene. So if the reaction is substitution on the butenyl group, perhaps multiple substitution positions are possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration, but that's not clear.

Another angle: the starting material has a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, but that would make the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

When HBr is added, the possible reaction is either addition across the double bond or substitution.

If it's addition, then the product would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3. But wait, that would be if H adds to one end and Br to the other, but that would lead to a specific stereochemistry. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond could shift, leading to a more stable carbocation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a bromination at the allylic position. So the Br would add to the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

In the case of O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the allylic positions are the CH2 groups attached to the double bond. So the allylic positions are the CH2-C(CH3)2 and the CH2-CH2 groups. Wait, maybe not. The allylic position is any carbon adjacent to the double bond. So in the butenyl group, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the allylic positions are C2 and C4. But in the starting structure, the butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. The allylic positions are C2 and C4. So the Br could add to C2 or C4.

Wait, but C4 is a terminal CH2, so it's only attached to one carbon. So perhaps bromination occurs at C2.

Wait, but the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the butenyl group is:

O-CH2- C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2?

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Let me try again. The correct IUPAC name is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So but-3-en-1-yl is:

1: CH2-O-

2: CH2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

But with a double bond between 3 and 4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, so on carbon 2, which is the second CH2, there are two methyl groups. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the structure is:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2

So the butenyl group is attached via an ether linkage. Now, when HBr is added, what could happen?

If the reaction involves allylic bromination, then the Br would be added to one of the allylic positions. In this case, the allylic positions are the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. Looking at the structure, the double bond is between CH=CH2. So the allylic positions are the CH2-C(CH3)2 and the CH2-CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps the allylic positions are the CH2-C(CH3)2 and the CH2 in the double bond.

Wait, maybe the bromine could add to the carbon next to the double bond, which is C2 (the CH2-C(CH3)2) or C4 (the CH2 in CH=CH2). But adding Br to C4 would be at the end, perhaps leading to a more stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a more stable carbocation. If the butenyl group is protonated, leading to a carbocation, which could then be attacked by Br-.

Wait, in the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, then adding HBr could lead to either 3-bromide or 4-bromide addition, but perhaps the more stable carbocation would form at the more substituted position.

Wait, the double bond is CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So when HBr adds across the double bond, the possible products are (from acid catalysis):

Protonation of the double bond would occur at the less substituted end, leading to the formation of a more stable carbocation.

So in this case, the double bond is CH=CH2. Protonation could occur on either end.

If H adds to the CH2 end (the end with more substituents), the carbocation would form on the adjacent carbon, which is already substituted with methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between CH2-C(CH3)2 and CH2-CH2. Let me think again. The structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the double bond is between the third and fourth carbons. The third carbon is attached to C(CH3)2, and the fourth is CH2.

If the double bond is protonated on the less substituted end (the fourth carbon, CH2), then the carbocation would form on the third carbon, which is attached to C(CH3)2. That's a tertiary carbocation, which is very stable.

Alternatively, if the proton adds to the third carbon (which is attached to C(CH3)2), the carbocation would form on the fourth carbon (CH2), which is less stable, a secondary carbocation.

So the more favorable pathway is protonation leading to the tertiary carbocation.

Then, Br- would attack the carbocation, leading to substitution at that position.

Wait, but the starting material is an ether, so the carbocation would be on the butenyl group, not on the benzene ring. So the bromide would add to the butenyl chain.

So the product would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2.

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, the addition could lead to O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution of the ether oxygen. But again, ethers are generally unreactive unless under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the HBr is causing the ether to undergo cleavage. But under what conditions? Acidic conditions might lead to cleavage, but I'm not sure if HBr alone is enough. Alternatively, HBr could act as a nucleophile, attacking the ether oxygen.

Wait, but the ether oxygen is a poor leaving group. Maybe the H+ from HBr protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group (H2O). Then, Br- could attack the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution. But that would require the structure to allow for such a substitution, perhaps in an SN2 mechanism.

But in the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the neighboring carbon (after the oxygen) is a CH2 group. So if the oxygen leaves as H2O, the Br could attack the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution. But that would require that the carbon is a good enough leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring substitution, but the benzene ring is not activated for electrophilic substitution under HBr conditions.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both products have bromo substituents on the butenyl group, but at different positions (3 and 4). So perhaps bromination occurred at two different positions on the butenyl group, leading to two products.

Alternatively, the reaction could involve bromide adding to different positions on the butenyl group, such as the 3rd and 4th carbons.

If the initial reaction adds Br to the 3rd carbon, making the product (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, and if another addition occurs at the 4th carbon, making (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, then option D would be the answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the starting material and the possible products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Upon reaction with HBr, the possible products are either substitution of the ether oxygen with Br, addition across the double bond, or bromination at the allylic position.

If the reaction is substitution of the ether oxygen, the product would be a bromide. But the options don't show that.

If the reaction is addition of HBr across the double bond, the product would have an added Br and H. But again, the options don't directly show that.

If the reaction is allylic bromination, adding Br to the allylic position, then two possible products could form, depending on where the Br adds.

Looking back, the starting material's butenyl group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The allylic positions are the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. So the possible positions are the CH2 attached to C(CH3)2 (position 2) and the CH2 attached to the double bond (position 4).

Wait, but position 4 is CH2, which is at the end of the chain. So bromination at position 4 would lead to a product like (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Similarly, bromination at position 3 (if possible) would give another product.

Wait, but the starting structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the possible positions for allylic bromination are C2 and C4. So adding Br to C2 would give (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene? Or wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, the butenyl group is four carbons:

1: O-CH2-

2: C(CH3)2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

But the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the allylic positions are C2 (next to C3) and C4 (next to C3? No, C4 is connected to C3 via a double bond, so the allylic positions are C2 and C4.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to number the carbons accurately.

The butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the structure is:

1: O-CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

But with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

But in the starting material, it's 2,2-dimethyl; so on carbon 2 (the second CH2), there are two methyl groups. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the four carbons are:

1: O-CH2-

2: C(CH3)2-

3: CH-

4: CH2

Double bond is between C3 and C4.

So the allylic positions are the carbons adjacent to the double bond, which are C2 and C4.

So adding Br at C2 would give a product where Br is on the C2, which is attached to two methyl groups. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-Br-CH=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the Br would add to C4, making O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CHBr.

Wait, but that's substitution in the butenyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding Br at the allylic position, leading to either the 3-bromo or 4-bromo product.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would directly relate to the options. Looking at option D, the products are 4-bromo and 3-bromo.

Wait, perhaps the original structure allows for bromination at two different positions, leading to both 3-bromo and 4-bromo products.

So if the reaction is allylic bromination, the Br could add to either C3 or C4, leading to two products. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a carbocation at C3, leading to Br addition there. But I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that option D is the correct answer. Because it shows two bromo-substituted products, each with Br at different positions on the butenyl group. This would happen if the reaction leads to bromination at two different allylic positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but a rearrangement leading to different structures. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the starting material is an ether with a substituent that can undergo acid-catalyzed reactions. HBr could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent carbon (CH2) could undergo nucleophilic attack by Br-, leading to substitution.

In that case, the product would be (2-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, but that's not one of the options. So that line of thought might be incorrect.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening, but I don't see how that would fit the options.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible option is that the reaction leads to substitution at two different positions on the butenyl group, leading to products as described in option D.


The starting material, (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene, is an ether with a butenyl group attached to a benzene ring. The butenyl group has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and two methyl groups on carbon 2. The reaction with hydrogen bromide (HBr) likely involves allylic bromination, where bromine is added to the carbons adjacent to the double bond (allylic positions).

### Key Analysis of the Reaction
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, and the allylic positions are carbons 2 and 4.

2. **Reaction with HBr**:  
   HBr can act as a source of Br- ions, which can brominate the allylic positions. This reaction typically occurs via a radical or carbocation mechanism, leading to bromination at the allylic carbons.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - Bromination at carbon 3 (a tertiary position due to the methyl groups) would yield (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.  
   - Bromination at carbon 4 (a secondary position) would yield (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.  
   These two products are consistent with the observation of two new spots in the TLC.

### Evaluation of the Options
- **Option A**: Suggests the formation of two phenols, which is unlikely because the reaction conditions (HBr) do not favor ether cleavage to phenols.  
- **Option B**: Proposes two products, one with a bromine at position 4 and another with a modified butenyl group. This does not align with the expected allylic bromination products.  
- **Option C**: Suggests the formation of bicyclic compounds, which is not supported by the reaction conditions or the structure of the starting material.  
- **Option D**: Indicates the formation of two brominated products, (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which matches the expected outcome of allylic bromination at positions 3 and 4.

### Conclusion
The reaction with HBr leads to allylic bromination at positions 3 and 4 of the butenyl group, resulting in the two products described in **Option D**.
