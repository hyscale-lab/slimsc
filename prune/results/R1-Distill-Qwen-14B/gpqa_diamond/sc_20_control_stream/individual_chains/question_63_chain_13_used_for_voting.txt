Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and quantum mechanics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, I remember that for diatomic molecules, the rotational model can be rigid rotor or non-rigid. But wait, the question specifically mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. So maybe it's a bit more complex than the simple rigid rotor case.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, right? So that's the ground state. Now, the question asks what momentum an absorbed photon should have to switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state — maybe that's the first excited state. But I need to think about how transitions work in this model.

I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. The energy levels are given by something like E_J = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy.

Wait, the question includes vibrational frequency (w) as 4e14 rad/s. So perhaps the molecule is treated in terms of vibration and rotation. Hmm, but the question seems to be about a transition between states, so maybe it's a change in rotational state, but triggered by a vibrational transition? Or maybe the photon is absorbed in a way that changes the vibrational state, which affects the rotational energy?

Wait, no, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state. Maybe this is about the selection rules. In rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But this is for pure rotational transitions. But if it's a vibration-rotational transition, the selection rules might involve both vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, but the question just mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, maybe in this case, the next state is the next vibrational level, or perhaps a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. So that would be the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state, assuming the vibrational state is the first one (v=0) and rotational state J=0 perhaps. But I'm not certain if the fundamental state includes both. So if the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state or rotational state.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the energy of the photon would be absorbed to cause a transition, and the photon's momentum is related to its energy via E = pc, since for a photon, E = hf = pc, where p is momentum. So if I can find the energy needed for the transition, I can find the momentum.

So the key is to find the energy difference between the initial state and the next state, which is the lowest possible. So the lowest possible next state would require the smallest energy jump. So perhaps the transition is a vibrational transition, which generally has higher energy than rotational transitions. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are closer together than the vibrational ones. So maybe the smallest transition is a rotational one.

But wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, so perhaps the transition is a vibrational one. Let me think: for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, with spacing hν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. So the fundamental state is v=0, and the first excited vibrational state is v=1. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is hν. So the photon would need to have energy equal to hν.

Wait, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So ν is equal to w/(2π). Oh, because ω is angular frequency, which is 2πν. So ν (frequency) = ω/(2π) = (4e14)/ (2π) ≈ (4/(6.28))e14 ≈ 0.6366e14 Hz. But wait, the energy of the photon would be hν, which is h multiplied by the frequency.

So the photon's energy E_photon = hν = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s / (2π)) ) = let me compute that. Alternatively, since the problem gives w, perhaps we can use the energy formula for vibration: E_vibrational = (1/2) h ω (v + 1/2), but the difference between v=0 and v=1 would be hω/2, because E(1) - E(0) = [ (1/2 hω (1 + 1/2) ) ] - [ (1/2 hω (0 + 1/2) ) ] = ½ hω (3/2 - 1/2) )= ½ hω (1) )= hω/2.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + ½) h ν, where ν is the frequency. Wait, but sometimes it's written as E_v = (v + ½) ℏ ω, because ℏ is h/(2π). So, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 would be E = h ν, where ν is ω/(2π). So E = h*(ω/(2π)).

Wait, but let me think again. The standard formula for vibrational energy levels is E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. So the spacing between adjacent levels is h ν. So if the molecule is in the v=0 state (fundamental), to get to v=1, the energy needed is h ν.

But wait, the problem says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' That suggests that the transition is the lowest possible energy jump, which would be the vibrational transition, perhaps. Alternatively, if the molecule is in the J=0 rotational state, the next rotational state is J=1, which has a lower energy than moving to the next vibrational state.

Wait, but which transition requires less energy: a rotational or a vibrational one? Because the rotational constants depend on the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a diatomic is I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass.

So the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2I) = (h^2)/(8 π² I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) )= 2B. So 2B.

So which is smaller: 2B or h ν? I need to compute both B and h ν and see which is smaller.

Given that the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) amu. Let's compute that.

Mx=20, My=2. μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.014. So 3.014e-27 kg.

So I = μ R^2 = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R^2 is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.014e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

Then B is (h²)/(8 π² I). Let me compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

So 8 π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (78.9568 * 1.2056e-46) ) = numerator =4.39e-67, denominator = 78.9568 *1.2056e-46 = approx 78.9568 *1.2056= about 95.19e-46? Wait, no, wait. 78.9568 *1.2056e-46 is 78.9568 *1.2056 = around 95.19, so 95.19e-46.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / (95.19e-46) ) = (4.39 /95.19) ) * 1e-21 (since 1e-67 /1e-46 = 1e-21) ). 4.39/95.19≈0.0461. So B ≈ 0.0461e-21 J. Which is 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Compare that to hν. ν is given as ω/(2π) =4e14 / (6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz. So hν is 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Wait, wait, that's way bigger than 2B, which was about 9.22e-23 J. So the energy needed for a rotational transition is about 9.22e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition energy of ~4.22e-20 J.

So the lowest possible energy jump is the rotational one, so the photon should have a momentum corresponding to the energy of 2B.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is in the fundamental state. What is the fundamental state in terms of J and v? The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0, perhaps. Or could J be higher? No, I think the ground state is J=0 and v=0.

So absorbing a photon to go to the next state would involve either increasing J to 1, or v to 1. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it's the lower energy transition. Therefore, the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 2B.

So the energy of the photon, E_photon, is 2B.

But wait, wait. The problem says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So perhaps the molecule could have a lower energy transition if it's allowed in the model. So for a diatomic, the rotational and vibrational transitions can be coupled. So the allowed transitions are when both J changes by ±1 and v changes by ±1, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, in the rovibrational spectrum, the transitions are Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. But in this case, if the molecule is in the v=0, J=0 state, the next state could be v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Wait, but according to selection rules for vibrational transitions, rotational states can change as well. For example, in infrared spectroscopy, the transition is a change in vibrational state (Δv=±1), and rotational state can change by ΔJ=±1. So the photon's energy would be around the vibrational frequency but with rotational fine structure.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, the next possible states would have higher energy. The next state with the lowest energy would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

The energy of v=1, J=0 would be E_vibrational(1) = h ν (since E_v = (v + ½) h ν, so difference is h ν from v=0). And E_rotational(J=1) is 2B. So which is smaller, h ν or 2B?

Earlier, I found that 2B is 9.22e-23 J, and h ν is about 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = let me recompute that.

Wait, ω is 4e14 rad/s, which is ω = 2π ν. So ν = ω/(2π) = (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So h ν = 6.626e-34 J·s *6.366e13 Hz = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = let me compute that.

6.626 *6.366 ≈ 42.25. So 42.25e-21 J. Which is 4.225e-20 J.

Comparing to 2B=9.22e-23 J. 9.22e-23 is smaller than 4.22e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon should be the one that allows a rotational transition.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. So the molecule in J=0 would transition to J=1. The energy difference is 2B.

So the photon's energy must be 2B. The momentum of the photon is p = E/c. Since E_photon = pc → p = E/(c).

So p = (2B)/(c).

Wait, no, E_photon = h ν = pc ⇒ p = E_photon / c. But wait, for a photon, E = pc, right? So yes, p = E/(c).

Wait, but earlier I thought the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J. So p = 9.22e-23 J·s/m / (3e8 m/s) → 9.22e-23 /3e8 → around 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But none of the options match this. Hmm, this suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in the initial approach. Maybe the transition is a vibrational one. Because in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational, and transitions can involve both. So the energy difference would be the difference between the vibrational levels plus the rotational levels.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which has lower energy? Let's calculate the energies.

E_vibrational for v=1 is (1 + ½) h ν. But wait, the vibrational energy is (v + ½) h ν, and the rotational is B J (J+1). So the total energy is E = (v + ½) h ν + B J (J+1).

For the initial state: v=0, J=0 → E_initial = (0 +½) h ν + B *0 = (½) h ν.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. But perhaps when the question says 'fundamental state', it's the lowest rotational and vibrational states. So E_initial = ½ h ν + 0.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make it clear.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are treated as a combination of both rotational and vibrational contributions. But sometimes, the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the initial energy is E_initial = (v=0) energy + (J=0) energy.

For the next state, the molecule can either go to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these has a lower energy?

E1 = [ (1 +½) h ν ] + B * 1*(1+1) → [ (3/2) h ν ] + 2B.

E2 = [ (0 +½) h ν ] + B * (1)(2) → [ (½) h ν ] + 2B.

So E1 - E_initial = [ (3/2 h ν) + 2B ] - [ ½ h ν ] = h ν + 2B.

E2 - E_initial = [ (½ h ν) + 2B ] - [ ½ h ν ] = 2B.

So the transition to E2 (v=0, J=1) requires 2B energy, while the transition to E1 (v=1, J=0) requires h ν + 2B. So the smaller energy jump is 2B, so the photon must have energy 2B.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B. Then, the momentum p = E_photon / c.

But wait, earlier calculation of B was 4.61e-23 J. So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

p = (9.22e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.073e-31 kg·m/s. Hmm, but the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, that's way smaller than the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B.

Let me recompute the reduced mass μ.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.014. So μ ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.014e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

Now, B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

8 π² ≈ 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator: 78.9568 * 1.2056e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2056 = 95.19, so denominator is 95.19e-46.

Wait, wait, no. I think I made a mistake here. I think I should compute 8 π² I, not 8 π² * I.

Wait, no, B = (h²)/(8 π² I). So I have h² =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 π² * I = 78.9568 * (1.2056e-46) → 78.9568 * 1.2056 = 95.19, so 95.19e-46.

So B = 4.39e-67 / (95.19e-46) = (4.39 /95.19) * 1e-21.

4.39 /95.19 ≈ 0.04612.

So B ≈ 0.04612e-21 J → 4.612e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.224e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon is 9.224e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = (9.224e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.224e-23) / 3e8 = 3.075e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, none of the options are around 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the selection rules. Maybe the next state involves a change in both J and v. So for a rovibrational transition, Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

But if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the transition could be to (v=1, J=1). The energy difference would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes.

But that would require more energy than just a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition. So the lowest possible energy jump is either 2B (rotational) or h ν (vibrational). But earlier, 2B is smaller than h ν.

Wait, but maybe the question assumes that the molecule is in the rotational ground state, but the lowest energy transition is a vibrational one because the rotational transitions are forbidden or something? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the harmonic oscillator plus rigid rotor model. In that case, the energy levels are quantized as E = E_rot + E_vib. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=1, J=0, which requires energy h ν. But perhaps the selection rule for vibration allows ΔJ=0, ±1, so the photon can cause a transition that changes J by 0, meaning J stays the same. So the energy would be just h ν.

But wait, if the photon only changes vibrational state and not rotational, then the energy is h ν. Let's compute h ν. ν = ω/(2π) = 4e14 / (2π *1) → about 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon = h ν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c = (4.22e-20 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s. Wait, because 1 N·s is equivalent to 1 kg·m/s. So yes, that's option D.

But wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the answer D, which is the vibrational transition?

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Earlier, I thought that 2B is smaller than h ν. But let's compare the two values again.

2B is 9.22e-23 J.

h ν is 4.22e-20 J.

Wait, 9.22e-23 is much smaller than 4.22e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the option D the answer? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, so the rotational energy isn't quantized in the same way as the rigid rotor. Or maybe the reduced mass is different in the non-rigid model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the model used here includes the vibrational energy in the calculation of the rotational constant. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the energy required to go from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which is v=1, J=0. So the energy difference is h ν.

But earlier, that was a much larger energy than the rotational transition. So why would the photon have to have that much energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational, because the vibrational is the dominant mode. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem statement says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So transitions would involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the state that requires the smallest energy change.

So if the molecule can transition either to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, the one with lower energy is v=0, J=1, which requires 2B (9.22e-23 J). But the options don't have a value around 3e-31 kg·m/s. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of B. Let me double-check the B calculation.

Original calculation:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

I = μ R^2 = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.014e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

Compute B = h²/(8 π² I).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 π² I = 8*(9.8696) *1.2056e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2056e-46.

78.9568 *1.2056 ≈ 95.19 → denominator is 95.19e-46.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 95.19e-46 = (4.39/95.19) * 1e-21.

4.39/95.19 ≈ 0.0461 → B ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is about 9.22e-23 J.

But the options are way bigger than that. So I must be missing something in the model.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the rotational energy in the non-rigid rotor, which could have a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of the photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the next state, which is the first excited vibrational state. So the photon's energy is h ν, which is 4.22e-20 J. So the momentum is (4.22e-20 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s, which is option D.

But why would the rotational transition require less energy and isn't the answer? Oh, perhaps because the rotational transitions require a change in J, which requires the photon to have specific angular momentum considerations, and perhaps the selection rule for vibration allows ΔJ=±1, but in this case, the molecule is in J=0, so the next state in vibration can only go to J=1 or stay at J=0. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon providing the necessary energy for a vibrational transition, regardless of rotation, and that's why the energy is h ν.

But according to the initial calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon have to provide more energy? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule can't rotate, so the only possible transition is vibrational. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the options. The only option in the 1e-28 range is D and A.

h ν gives us about 4.22e-20 J, which translates to p=1.4e-28 kg·m/s. Which is option D.

But earlier calculation for 2B gives a momentum of 3e-31, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D, which corresponds to h ν.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.

But that would be E = h ν + 2B, which is much higher than either.

So I'm a bit confused, but given the options, the only one that makes sense from the vibrational transition is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \(v = 0\) and the lowest rotational state \(J = 0\). The question asks for the momentum of the photon needed to excite the molecule to the next state with the lowest energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is given by:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
     \]
     where \(E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu\) and \(E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J + 1)\), with \(B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}\) being the rotational constant and \(I = \mu R^2\) the moment of inertia.

2. **Fundamental State and Next State**:
   - The fundamental state is \(v = 0, J = 0\), with energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} h \nu
     \]
   - The next possible states are:
     - \(v = 1, J = 0\) (pure vibrational transition)
     - \(v = 0, J = 1\) (pure rotational transition)

3. **Energy Difference for Transitions**:
   - For the pure vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu
     \]
   - For the pure rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B
     \]

4. **Comparison of Energies**:
   - The vibrational frequency is given as \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\), so the vibrational frequency in Hz is:
     \[
     \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
     \]
   - The energy of the vibrational transition is:
     \[
     h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.014 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}

   - The moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.014 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.2056 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2056 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).
   - For the vibrational transition (\(h \nu \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
   - For the rotational transition (\(2B \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the options provided correspond to the vibrational transition, suggesting the problem assumes the photon excites the molecule primarily through a vibrational transition.
   - The momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is approximately \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\), which matches option **D**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and quantum mechanics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, I remember that for diatomic molecules, the rotational model can be rigid rotor or non-rigid. But wait, the question specifically mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. So maybe it's a bit more complex than the simple rigid rotor case.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, right? So that's the ground state. Now, the question asks what momentum an absorbed photon should have to switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state — maybe that's the first excited state. But I need to think about how transitions work in this model.

I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. The energy levels are given by something like E_J = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy.

Wait, the question includes vibrational frequency (w) as 4e14 rad/s. So perhaps the molecule is treated in terms of vibration and rotation. Hmm, but the question seems to be about a transition between states, so maybe it's a change in rotational state, but triggered by a vibrational transition? Or maybe the photon is absorbed in a way that changes the vibrational state, which affects the rotational energy?

Wait, no, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state. Maybe this is about the selection rules. In rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But this is for pure rotational transitions. But if it's a vibration-rotational transition, the selection rules might involve both vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, but the question just mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, maybe in this case, the next state is the next vibrational level, or perhaps a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. So that would be the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state, assuming the vibrational state is the first one (v=0) and rotational state J=0 perhaps. But I'm not certain if the fundamental state includes both. So if the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state or rotational state.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the energy of the photon would be absorbed to cause a transition, and the photon's momentum is related to its energy via E = pc, since for a photon, E = hf = pc, where p is momentum. So if I can find the energy needed for the transition, I can find the momentum.

So the key is to find the energy difference between the initial state and the next state, which is the lowest possible. So the lowest possible next state would require the smallest energy jump. So perhaps the transition is a vibrational transition, which generally has higher energy than rotational transitions. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are closer together than the vibrational ones. So maybe the smallest transition is a rotational one.

But wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, so perhaps the transition is a vibrational one. Let me think: for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, with spacing hν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. So the fundamental state is v=0, and the first excited vibrational state is v=1. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is hν. So the photon would need to have energy equal to hν.

Wait, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So ν is equal to w/(2π). Oh, because ω is angular frequency, which is 2πν. So ν (frequency) = ω/(2π) = (4e14)/ (2π) ≈ (4/(6.28))e14 ≈ 0.6366e14 Hz. But wait, the energy of the photon would be hν, which is h multiplied by the frequency.

So the photon's energy E_photon = hν = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s / (2π)) ) = let me compute that. Alternatively, since the problem gives w, perhaps we can use the energy formula for vibration: E_vibrational = (1/2) h ω (v + 1/2), but the difference between v=0 and v=1 would be hω/2, because E(1) - E(0) = [ (1/2 hω (1 + 1/2) ) ] - [ (1/2 hω (0 + 1/2) ) ] = ½ hω (3/2 - 1/2) )= ½ hω (1) )= hω/2.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + ½) h ν, where ν is the frequency. Wait, but sometimes it's written as E_v = (v + ½) ℏ ω, because ℏ is h/(2π). So, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 would be E = h ν, where ν is ω/(2π). So E = h*(ω/(2π)).

Wait, but let me think again. The standard formula for vibrational energy levels is E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. So the spacing between adjacent levels is h ν. So if the molecule is in the v=0 state (fundamental), to get to v=1, the energy needed is h ν.

But wait, the problem says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' That suggests that the transition is the lowest possible energy jump, which would be the vibrational transition, perhaps. Alternatively, if the molecule is in the J=0 rotational state, the next rotational state is J=1, which has a lower energy than moving to the next vibrational state.

Wait, but which transition requires less energy: a rotational or a vibrational one? Because the rotational constants depend on the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a diatomic is I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass.

So the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2I) = (h^2)/(8 π² I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) )= 2B. So 2B.

So which is smaller: 2B or h ν? I need to compute both B and h ν and see which is smaller.

Given that the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) amu. Let's compute that.

Mx=20, My=2. μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.014. So 3.014e-27 kg.

So I = μ R^2 = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R^2 is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.014e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

Then B is (h²)/(8 π² I). Let me compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

So 8 π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (78.9568 * 1.2056e-46) ) = numerator =4.39e-67, denominator = 78.9568 *1.2056e-46 = approx 78.9568 *1.2056= about 95.19e-46? Wait, no, wait. 78.9568 *1.2056e-46 is 78.9568 *1.2056 = around 95.19, so 95.19e-46.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / (95.19e-46) ) = (4.39 /95.19) ) * 1e-21 (since 1e-67 /1e-46 = 1e-21) ). 4.39/95.19≈0.0461. So B ≈ 0.0461e-21 J. Which is 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Compare that to hν. ν is given as ω/(2π) =4e14 / (6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz. So hν is 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Wait, wait, that's way bigger than 2B, which was about 9.22e-23 J. So the energy needed for a rotational transition is about 9.22e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition energy of ~4.22e-20 J.

So the lowest possible energy jump is the rotational one, so the photon should have a momentum corresponding to the energy of 2B.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is in the fundamental state. What is the fundamental state in terms of J and v? The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0, perhaps. Or could J be higher? No, I think the ground state is J=0 and v=0.

So absorbing a photon to go to the next state would involve either increasing J to 1, or v to 1. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it's the lower energy transition. Therefore, the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 2B.

So the energy of the photon, E_photon, is 2B.

But wait, wait. The problem says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So perhaps the molecule could have a lower energy transition if it's allowed in the model. So for a diatomic, the rotational and vibrational transitions can be coupled. So the allowed transitions are when both J changes by ±1 and v changes by ±1, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, in the rovibrational spectrum, the transitions are Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. But in this case, if the molecule is in the v=0, J=0 state, the next state could be v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Wait, but according to selection rules for vibrational transitions, rotational states can change as well. For example, in infrared spectroscopy, the transition is a change in vibrational state (Δv=±1), and rotational state can change by ΔJ=±1. So the photon's energy would be around the vibrational frequency but with rotational fine structure.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, the next possible states would have higher energy. The next state with the lowest energy would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

The energy of v=1, J=0 would be E_vibrational(1) = h ν (since E_v = (v + ½) h ν, so difference is h ν from v=0). And E_rotational(J=1) is 2B. So which is smaller, h ν or 2B?

Earlier, I found that 2B is 9.22e-23 J, and h ν is about 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = let me recompute that.

Wait, ω is 4e14 rad/s, which is ω = 2π ν. So ν = ω/(2π) = (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So h ν = 6.626e-34 J·s *6.366e13 Hz = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = let me compute that.

6.626 *6.366 ≈ 42.25. So 42.25e-21 J. Which is 4.225e-20 J.

Comparing to 2B=9.22e-23 J. 9.22e-23 is smaller than 4.22e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon should be the one that allows a rotational transition.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. So the molecule in J=0 would transition to J=1. The energy difference is 2B.

So the photon's energy must be 2B. The momentum of the photon is p = E/c. Since E_photon = pc → p = E/(c).

So p = (2B)/(c).

Wait, no, E_photon = h ν = pc ⇒ p = E_photon / c. But wait, for a photon, E = pc, right? So yes, p = E/(c).

Wait, but earlier I thought the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J. So p = 9.22e-23 J·s/m / (3e8 m/s) → 9.22e-23 /3e8 → around 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But none of the options match this. Hmm, this suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in the initial approach. Maybe the transition is a vibrational one. Because in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational, and transitions can involve both. So the energy difference would be the difference between the vibrational levels plus the rotational levels.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which has lower energy? Let's calculate the energies.

E_vibrational for v=1 is (1 + ½) h ν. But wait, the vibrational energy is (v + ½) h ν, and the rotational is B J (J+1). So the total energy is E = (v + ½) h ν + B J (J+1).

For the initial state: v=0, J=0 → E_initial = (0 +½) h ν + B *0 = (½) h ν.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. But perhaps when the question says 'fundamental state', it's the lowest rotational and vibrational states. So E_initial = ½ h ν + 0.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make it clear.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are treated as a combination of both rotational and vibrational contributions. But sometimes, the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the initial energy is E_initial = (v=0) energy + (J=0) energy.

For the next state, the molecule can either go to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these has a lower energy?

E1 = [ (1 +½) h ν ] + B * 1*(1+1) → [ (3/2) h ν ] + 2B.

E2 = [ (0 +½) h ν ] + B * (1)(2) → [ (½) h ν ] + 2B.

So E1 - E_initial = [ (3/2 h ν) + 2B ] - [ ½ h ν ] = h ν + 2B.

E2 - E_initial = [ (½ h ν) + 2B ] - [ ½ h ν ] = 2B.

So the transition to E2 (v=0, J=1) requires 2B energy, while the transition to E1 (v=1, J=0) requires h ν + 2B. So the smaller energy jump is 2B, so the photon must have energy 2B.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B. Then, the momentum p = E_photon / c.

But wait, earlier calculation of B was 4.61e-23 J. So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

p = (9.22e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.073e-31 kg·m/s. Hmm, but the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, that's way smaller than the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B.

Let me recompute the reduced mass μ.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.014. So μ ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.014e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

Now, B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

8 π² ≈ 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator: 78.9568 * 1.2056e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2056 = 95.19, so denominator is 95.19e-46.

Wait, wait, no. I think I made a mistake here. I think I should compute 8 π² I, not 8 π² * I.

Wait, no, B = (h²)/(8 π² I). So I have h² =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 π² * I = 78.9568 * (1.2056e-46) → 78.9568 * 1.2056 = 95.19, so 95.19e-46.

So B = 4.39e-67 / (95.19e-46) = (4.39 /95.19) * 1e-21.

4.39 /95.19 ≈ 0.04612.

So B ≈ 0.04612e-21 J → 4.612e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.224e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon is 9.224e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = (9.224e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.224e-23) / 3e8 = 3.075e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, none of the options are around 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the selection rules. Maybe the next state involves a change in both J and v. So for a rovibrational transition, Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

But if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the transition could be to (v=1, J=1). The energy difference would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes.

But that would require more energy than just a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition. So the lowest possible energy jump is either 2B (rotational) or h ν (vibrational). But earlier, 2B is smaller than h ν.

Wait, but maybe the question assumes that the molecule is in the rotational ground state, but the lowest energy transition is a vibrational one because the rotational transitions are forbidden or something? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the harmonic oscillator plus rigid rotor model. In that case, the energy levels are quantized as E = E_rot + E_vib. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=1, J=0, which requires energy h ν. But perhaps the selection rule for vibration allows ΔJ=0, ±1, so the photon can cause a transition that changes J by 0, meaning J stays the same. So the energy would be just h ν.

But wait, if the photon only changes vibrational state and not rotational, then the energy is h ν. Let's compute h ν. ν = ω/(2π) = 4e14 / (2π *1) → about 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon = h ν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c = (4.22e-20 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s. Wait, because 1 N·s is equivalent to 1 kg·m/s. So yes, that's option D.

But wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the answer D, which is the vibrational transition?

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Earlier, I thought that 2B is smaller than h ν. But let's compare the two values again.

2B is 9.22e-23 J.

h ν is 4.22e-20 J.

Wait, 9.22e-23 is much smaller than 4.22e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the option D the answer? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, so the rotational energy isn't quantized in the same way as the rigid rotor. Or maybe the reduced mass is different in the non-rigid model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the model used here includes the vibrational energy in the calculation of the rotational constant. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the energy required to go from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which is v=1, J=0. So the energy difference is h ν.

But earlier, that was a much larger energy than the rotational transition. So why would the photon have to have that much energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational, because the vibrational is the dominant mode. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem statement says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So transitions would involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the state that requires the smallest energy change.

So if the molecule can transition either to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, the one with lower energy is v=0, J=1, which requires 2B (9.22e-23 J). But the options don't have a value around 3e-31 kg·m/s. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of B. Let me double-check the B calculation.

Original calculation:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

I = μ R^2 = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.014e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

Compute B = h²/(8 π² I).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 π² I = 8*(9.8696) *1.2056e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2056e-46.

78.9568 *1.2056 ≈ 95.19 → denominator is 95.19e-46.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 95.19e-46 = (4.39/95.19) * 1e-21.

4.39/95.19 ≈ 0.0461 → B ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is about 9.22e-23 J.

But the options are way bigger than that. So I must be missing something in the model.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the rotational energy in the non-rigid rotor, which could have a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of the photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the next state, which is the first excited vibrational state. So the photon's energy is h ν, which is 4.22e-20 J. So the momentum is (4.22e-20 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s, which is option D.

But why would the rotational transition require less energy and isn't the answer? Oh, perhaps because the rotational transitions require a change in J, which requires the photon to have specific angular momentum considerations, and perhaps the selection rule for vibration allows ΔJ=±1, but in this case, the molecule is in J=0, so the next state in vibration can only go to J=1 or stay at J=0. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon providing the necessary energy for a vibrational transition, regardless of rotation, and that's why the energy is h ν.

But according to the initial calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon have to provide more energy? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule can't rotate, so the only possible transition is vibrational. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the options. The only option in the 1e-28 range is D and A.

h ν gives us about 4.22e-20 J, which translates to p=1.4e-28 kg·m/s. Which is option D.

But earlier calculation for 2B gives a momentum of 3e-31, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D, which corresponds to h ν.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.

But that would be E = h ν + 2B, which is much higher than either.

So I'm a bit confused, but given the options, the only one that makes sense from the vibrational transition is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \(v = 0\) and the lowest rotational state \(J = 0\). The question asks for the momentum of the photon needed to excite the molecule to the next state with the lowest energy.

     \[
     E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
     \]
     where \(E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu\) and \(E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J + 1)\), with \(B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}\) being the rotational constant and \(I = \mu R^2\) the moment of inertia.

2. **Fundamental State and Next State**:
   - The fundamental state is \(v = 0, J = 0\), with energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} h \nu
     \]
   - The next possible states are:
     - \(v = 1, J = 0\) (pure vibrational transition)
     - \(v = 0, J = 1\) (pure rotational transition)

3. **Energy Difference for Transitions**:
   - For the pure vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu
     \]
   - For the pure rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B
     \]

4. **Comparison of Energies**:
   - The vibrational frequency is given as \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\), so the vibrational frequency in Hz is:
     \[
     \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
     \]
   - The energy of the vibrational transition is:
     \[
     h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.014 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.014 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.2056 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2056 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).
   - For the vibrational transition (\(h \nu \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
   - For the rotational transition (\(2B \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the options provided correspond to the vibrational transition, suggesting the problem assumes the photon excites the molecule primarily through a vibrational transition.
   - The momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is approximately \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\), which matches option **D**.
