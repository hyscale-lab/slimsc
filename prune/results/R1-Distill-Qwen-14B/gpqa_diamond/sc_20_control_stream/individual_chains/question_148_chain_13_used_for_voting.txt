Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Binary compounds usually mean two elements, so Y and F in these compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and some reactions they undergo, and we need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me break down the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, oF usually stands for oxygen-free, but wait, maybe it's the oxygen content? Or wait, maybe oF here refers to the oxygen-free fraction? Or perhaps it's the formula of A2. Wait, no, oF isn't a standard term. Wait, maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine in A2? Or perhaps it's the oxygen content in A2? Hmm, not sure. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass. So A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, but when it's oxidized, maybe it's being fluorinated? Because fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So A1 could be a strong oxidizing agent.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps A3 is YF (binary, so Y plus F). Wait, but fluorinating Y likely gives different compounds depending on oxidation states. So maybe Y has multiple oxidation states.

By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So A5 is probably a salt that reacts with water to produce something else, like maybe hydrolysis.

Let me think about the possible compounds. Fluorine often forms compounds like YF, YF2, YF3, etc., depending on the element Y.

The key here is to figure out what Y is. Since all compounds are with fluorine, Y is probably a halogen, perhaps? But wait, the compounds are binary, so Y is another element that forms multiple binary fluorides.

Wait, element Y is forming five binary compounds with fluorine. Let me think about elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2, but that's only two. Maybe sulfur? Sulfur has SF2, SF4, SF6. Wait, that's three, but the question says five. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine? Let me think: chlorine forms ClF, ClF2 (which is Cl2F2?), ClF3, ClF4, ClF5? Wait, but ClF5 is a known compound. Wait, maybe Y is chlorine. So five binary fluorides would include ClF, ClF2, ClF3, ClF4, ClF5. Yeah, that makes five.

Wait, but I'm not sure if ClF exists. I think chlorine typically forms ClF3, ClF5, etc. Maybe I should think of another element. Let's see. Another possibility is iodine. Iodine forms IF, IF3, IF5. Hmm, that's three. Not five.

Wait, another idea: perhaps Y is oxygen? But O forms two fluorides, like OF2 and perhaps O2F2. Not five.

Wait, maybe Y is phosphorus? Phosphorus forms PF3, PF5. Only two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is nitrogen. Nitrogen forms NF3 and maybe others? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So the reaction is A1 → A2 + F2. Since A1 is decomposing to form fluorine, maybe A1 is a compound that releases F2 upon decomposition.

Wait, fluorine is F2, a diatomic molecule. So the decomposition of A1 might produce F2 gas. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride that, when heated, breaks down into a lower fluoride plus F2.

So for example, maybe A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let me check:

YF5 → YF3 + F2.

So, how would that work? Let's calculate the fluorine percentage in A2. A2 is YF3. So, what's the fluorine percentage?

Suppose Y has a molar mass of M. Then, YF3 has a molar mass of M + 3*19 = M +57.

Fluorine percentage would be (3*19)/(M+57) *100% = 31.96%.

So, let's set up the equation:

(57 / (M +57)) *3 = 31.96.

Wait, 3*19 is 57. So,

57/(M +57) = 0.3196.

Multiply both sides by (M +57):

57 = 0.3196 * (M +57).

Calculate 0.3196 *57 ≈ 18. So,

57 = 0.3196 M + 18.18.

57 - 18.18 = 0.3196 M.

38.82 = 0.3196 M.

M = 38.82 / 0.3196 ≈ 121.48 g/mol.

So Y would have a molar mass around 121.48. Let me think about elements near that atomic weight. Iodine is about 127, which is close. Chlorine is about 35.5, which is way off. Maybe Y is iodine?

Wait, if Y is iodine (I), then YF3 would be IF3.

Let me check the fluorine percentage in IF3.

I has a molar mass of ~127.

IF3: 3 F atoms. 3*19 =57 g.

Total molar mass: 127 +57=184 g/mol.

Fluorine percentage: (57/184)*100 ≈31.08%. Hmm, the given is 31.96%, which is a bit higher. Maybe Y is another element. Let me recalculate.

Wait, our calculation gave M≈121.5, so perhaps Y is tellurium (Te), which has a molar mass around 128. Yes, Te is about 128. Let me see.

If Y is Te, then TeF3.

Te: ~128 g/mol.

TeF3: 128 +3*19 = 128 +57=185 g/mol.

Fluorine percentage: (57/185)*100 ≈30.8%. Hmm, still a bit lower than 31.96.

Alternatively, maybe Y is bromine? No, bromine is about 80, which would make YF3's molar mass 80 +57=137. Then F% is 57/137 ≈41.6%. That's higher than 31.96.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Equation: (3*19) / (M +3*19) = 0.3196.

So,

57 = 0.3196 * (M +57)

57 = 0.3196 M + 0.3196 *57.

Calculate 0.3196 *57: 0.3*57=17.1, 0.0196*57≈1.1112. Total ≈18.2112.

So,

57 = 0.3196 M + 18.2112.

Subtract: 57 -18.2112 =38.7888 =0.3196 M.

M=38.7888 /0.3196 ≈121.3 g/mol.

So Y is around 121.3, which is close to Iodine (126.9 g/mol). Hmm, 121 is between tellurium (127.6) and iodine.

Wait, maybe Y is another element. Wait, what if Y is Yttrium (Y), but its atomic mass is about 89, which is too low.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the assumption of A1 and A2. Maybe A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF4 and F2? Let me re-examine.

If A1 is YF5, and A2 is YF4. Then A2's F% would be (4*19)/(M +4*19) *100 =31.96%.

So,

(76)/(M+76) =0.3196.

76 =0.3196*(M +76).

76 =0.3196M + 0.3196*76.

0.3196 *76 ≈24.2896.

76 -24.2896 =51.7104=0.3196 M.

M=51.7104 /0.3196 ≈161.6.

Hmm, that would make M around 162, which is higher than Iodine. But maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Hmm, what element has a molar mass around 162? That's about the molar mass of lead (Pb is 207.2), but that's higher. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the decomposition is different. Suppose A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. Wait, but if A2 is YF2, then F% would be (38)/(M+38) =31.96%.

38/(M+38)=0.3196 → 38 =0.3196*(M+38).

0.3196 M + 12.1448 =38.

0.3196 M =25.8552 → M≈80.95.

Which element is around 80? That's bromine (molar mass ~80). So perhaps Y is Br.

So, if Y is bromine, let's see:

A1 is BrF3, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2?

Wait, but does BrF3 decompose? I thought BrF3 is stable, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine, but Cl has a lower molar mass.

Wait, let me see. If Y is bromine:

A2 is BrF2. Let's calculate F% in BrF2.

Br is ~80, so 80 + 38 = 118 g/mol.

F% is (38/118)*100 ≈32.2%. Oh wait, that's very close to 31.96% which we have. So this fits.

So Y is bromine (Br). So A2 is BrF2.

So A1 is decomposing into BrF2 and F2. So the reaction could be:

BrF3 → BrF2 + F2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if BrF3 decomposes like that. Alternatively, A1 could be BrF5, but that's a stretch.

But let's proceed with this assumption for now.

So, Y is bromine.

Now, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y is Br, and A3 is BrF?

Wait, but what is A3? The problem states that A3 can also interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas; when it interacts with fluorine compounds, it usually forms XeF2, XeF4, etc. So perhaps A3 is a strong fluorinating agent, like BrF3 or BrF5, which can react with Xe.

But earlier, we supposed A3 is BrF2. Wait, no, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Br), so perhaps A3 is BrF, BrF2, BrF3, etc. But A3 is a binary compound, so it's YF in some form.

Wait, but BrF is not a known compound; BrF3 is more common. So perhaps A3 is BrF3.

Alternatively, perhaps A3 is BrF5, which is another known compound.

But let's think about the next part. When Y (Br) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

So A4 is a solution of something. When Br is added, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromine compound. Wait, no, because adding Br to A4 produces A5.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, A4 could be a solution of a fluoride, perhaps.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions. When Br is added to a solution of a fluoride, perhaps an acid is formed. Or maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, when a fluoride (like NaF) solution is treated with Br, perhaps nothing happens. Alternatively, if A4 is a concentrated solution, perhaps it's a hydrofluoric acid solution, but that's not likely because hydrofluoric acid is not very concentrated in aqueous solution.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromide compound, like KBrO3 or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: what's the structure of the reaction where adding Y (Br) to a solution gives A5, which then decomposes in water.

If A5 is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis, perhaps it's something like KBrO3. But wait, if A4 is a solution of KBrO3, adding Br in 1:1 molar ratio? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a bromide salt formed from A4. Let me think about the possibilities.

Wait, when you add Br to a fluoride solution, perhaps it displaces F, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, and when Br is added, a more stable compound is formed. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding Br in a 1:1 ratio produces a bromide and releases F gas? For example, if A4 is MgF2, adding Br might not do much. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is a salt that hydrolyzes, for example, something like CaF2, but that doesn't react with water. Alternatively, if A5 is NaF, it's soluble and doesn't decompose. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the decomposition of A5. It produces two substances. Maybe one is F and the other is something else. For example, if A5 is NaF, it would just stay as Na+ and F- in solution. Not decomposition. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex salt.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a perfluoride or something else. Alternatively, maybe A5 is a bromide, like KBrO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of BrF5. When Br is added, perhaps it reacts to form something else. But this is getting a bit fuzzy.

Alternatively, let's think about what A4 could be. Since A4 is a solution, perhaps it's a strong acid. For example, H2SO4 is a concentrated, hot solution. But how would adding Br to H2SO4 produce A5, which then decomposes in water?

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options for the molecular weight of A4 and see which makes sense based on Y being Br.

The options are:
A) 140-160
B) 220-240
C) 160-180
D) 110-130

We thought Y is Br (molar mass ~80). So A4 is a binary compound with Br and F. So possible compounds include BrF, BrF3, BrF5.

Wait, but what is A4? The problem says that when Y is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. So perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromine fluoride, like BrF3 or BrF5.

Wait, if A4 is BrF5, what would happen when Br is added? Not sure. Alternatively, if A4 is a solution of a bromide, like KBrO3, but that's not a fluoride.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the molecular weight of A4, which is a binary compound. If A4's molecular weight is in one of the given ranges, and Y is Br, let's see what possible BrF compounds fit into these ranges.

Br's molar mass is about 80. Let's see:

- BrF: 80 +19=99 → falls into D) 110-130? No, it's lower.
- BrF3: 80 + 3*19=80+57=137 → D is 110-130, so 137 is above.
- BrF5: 80 +5*19=80+95=175 → which is in option C (160-180).

So if A4 is BrF5 (molecular weight 175), then the correct range would be option C.

But wait, the question says A4 is a solution, but BrF5 is a liquid at room temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt, like KBrF4 or something else. Wait, but the problem says it's a binary compound of Y (Br) and fluorine. So A4 must be BrF_x.

So if A4 is BrF5, the molecular weight is 175, which is in option C (160-180).

Alternatively, another compound: BrF3 has a molecular weight of 137, which is in option D (110-130). Not matching.

Hmm, but let's think again about the initial steps. If A1 is a bright-red substance. Fluorine compounds that are bright red include F2 (which is a gas, pale yellow) or perhaps some fluorides. Wait, I'm trying to think of any bright red fluorides. Another possibility is chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which is a red-brown liquid, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is chlorine. Let's consider that possibility. If Y is Cl (atomic weight ~35.5), then A2's F% would be 31.96%.

So for A2 being ClF3: molecular weight is 35.5 + 3*19 =35.5+57=92.5. F% is (57/92.5)*100≈61.6%. That's higher than 31.96%. Doesn't fit.

If A2 is ClF, then F% is 19/(35.5+19)=19/54.5≈34.8%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, not exact but closer.

Wait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong A1 and A2.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 produces fluorine gas. So A1 must be a compound that can release F2 upon decomposition. For example, perhaps A1 is F2 itself, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a higher fluoride that breaks down into F2 and another fluoride.

Wait, another possibility: A1 is ClF5, which when heated decomposes into ClF3 and F2. Let me calculate the fluorine percentage in ClF3.

ClF3: Cl is ~35.5, 3F=57. Total 92.5. F% is 57/92.5 ≈61.6%. Doesn't match 31.96%.

Alternatively, if A2 is ClF, which is 35.5 +19=54.5. F% is 19/54.5≈34.8% → close to 31.96% but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y isn't Cl or Br, but another element. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure of A5. When adding Y (Br) to A4's solution, perhaps a precipitation reaction occurs. For example, if A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, like AgBr, but adding Br wouldn't do much. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a fluoride, and adding Br produces a bromide and releases F.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a solution of HClO4 (but that's not a binary compound of Br and F). Alternatively, perhaps it's a solution of a bromide fluoride, like BrF3 in water, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

Assumption:

- Y is Br, because the fluorine percentage in A2 (BrF2) is around 32%, matching the given 31.96%.

So Y is Br. Then, A4 is a binary compound of Br and F, so possible candidates are BrF, BrF3, BrF5.

If A4 is BrF5, then its molar mass is 175 g/mol, which would fall into option C (160-180).

So the correct range for the molecular weight of A4 would be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that A4 is a solution, but BrF5 is a liquid. Is it possible that A4 is BrF5? Maybe it's dissolved in some solvent?

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is another compound.

Wait, the problem states that A4 is a binary compound of Y and F, so it's YF_x. So if A4 is BrF3, its molar mass is 137, which is in option D (110-130). But earlier calculation with Y=Br, A2=BrF2 gives a molar mass of Br as ~121, but Br's actual molar mass is 80. So perhaps my earlier assumption about Y is incorrect.

Wait, wait a minute. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the calculation.

We had:

(3 * 19) / (M + 3 * 19) ) = 0.3196.

Wait, that's for A2 being YF3. So solving for M:

57 / (M +57) = 0.3196 → M +57 = 57 / 0.3196.

Wait, 57 / 0.3196 ≈178.3 → M≈178.3 -57=121.3.

So Y's molar mass is around 121.3. Which element is that? Iodine is about 127, tellurium is 128. Hmm, perhaps Y is tellurium (Te) with a molar mass of about 128.

So if Y is Te, then A2 is TeF3.

TeF3's molar mass: 128 +57=185 g/mol. F% is 57/185 *100 ≈30.8%, which is close to 31.96% but not exact. Maybe the given value is approximate, so let's proceed.

So Y is Te. Now, the compounds would be TeF, TeF2, TeF3, TeF4, TeF5? Are these known? I'm not certain, but let's proceed.

Now, A4 is a binary compound of Te and F. So possibilities are TeF, TeF2, etc.

If A4 is TeF5, its molar mass would be 128 +5*19=128+95=223. Which is in option B (220-240). Alternatively, TeF3 has 185, which is in option C (160-180). Hmm.

But earlier, in the decomposition, A1 → A2 + F2. If A1 is TeF5, and upon decomposition, it produces TeF3 and F2.

So the reaction would be TeF5 → TeF3 + F2.

Now, the F% in TeF3 is 57/185= ~30.8%, which is close to A2's 31.96%, so that's acceptable.

So if A4 is TeF5, its molecular weight is 223, which falls into option B (220-240). So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Y as Te.

Another approach: let's think of the possible options. The options are A, B, C, D. The molecular weight of A4 is a binary compound of Y and F. If Y is around 121, then possible compounds:

YF: 121 +19=140 → option A (140-160).
YF3: 121+57=178 → option C (160-180).
YF5: 121 +95=216 → option B (220-240) is 216 not in that range, because 216 is 216, which is above 220 is option B? No, 216 is below 220. Hmm.

Wait, option B is 220-240. So 216 is below that. So perhaps YF5 isn't a candidate.

Alternatively, YF4: 121 +4*19=121+76=197 → which is in option C (160-180? No, 197 is higher than 180. So option C is 160-180, so 197 is outside.

Hmm, perhaps YF3 would be the best fit. Its molecular weight is 178, which is in option C.

Wait, so if A4 is YF3, then its molecular weight is 178, which is in option C.

But earlier, we thought that A4 is a solution. So if A4 is YF3 (which is a solid?), perhaps it's dissolved in something. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3.

In that case, when Y is added (in 1:1 molar ratio), perhaps it reacts with YF3 to produce another compound. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound.

This is getting a bit tangled, and I'm not sure which direction to take. Given the time I've spent, maybe I should make an educated guess based on the calculations.

From earlier, when Y was assumed to be Br, A4 could be BrF5 with a molecular weight of 175, which is in option C. Alternatively, if Y is Te, A4 could be TeF3 (185 g/mol), also in option C.

But I'm more confident that Y is Br because the fluorine percentage in BrF2 was very close to the given 31.96%. So with Y as Br, A4 would be BrF5 (175 g/mol), which is in option C (160-180).

So, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of element Y and fluorine. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Information and Assumptions**:
   - Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.
   - A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F₂).
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, suggesting A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can interact with xenon.
   - A4, when mixed with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio, forms A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - A2 is identified as a fluoride compound (YFₓ) with 31.96% fluorine by mass. Using the formula for fluorine percentage:
     \[
     \text{Fluorine percentage} = \frac{\text{Mass of fluorine}}{\text{Molar mass of compound}} \times 100
     \]
     For A2 (YF₃), the molar mass is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{3 \times 19}{M + 57} \times 100 = 31.96
     \]
     Solving for \(M\), the molar mass of Y is approximately 121.3 g/mol. This aligns closely with bromine (Br, ~80 g/mol) or tellurium (Te, ~128 g/mol). Bromine is favored due to its known binary fluorides and the given fluorine percentage.

3. **Analyzing A4**:
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. Possible candidates include YF, YF₃, YF₅, etc. For Y = Br:
     - BrF: Molar mass = \(80 + 19 = 99\) g/mol (not in the given ranges).
     - BrF₃: Molar mass = \(80 + 57 = 137\) g/mol (not in the given ranges).
     - BrF₅: Molar mass = \(80 + 95 = 175\) g/mol, which falls in the range **160-180** (option C).
   - For Y = Te:
     - TeF₃: Molar mass = \(128 + 57 = 185\) g/mol, which also falls in the range **160-180** (option C).
     - TeF₅: Molar mass = \(128 + 95 = 223\) g/mol, which falls in the range **220-240** (option B).

4. **Final Determination**:
   - Based on the decomposition of A1 into A2 (likely BrF₂ or TeF₃) and the formation of A5, the most plausible candidate for A4 is BrF₅ (molar mass 175 g/mol) or TeF₃ (molar mass 185 g/mol). Both fall within the range **160-180** (option C).

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 falls in the range **160-180**.

Answer: C
