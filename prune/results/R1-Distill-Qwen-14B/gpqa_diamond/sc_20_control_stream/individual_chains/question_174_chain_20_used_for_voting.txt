Okay, so I've got this physics problem about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So, the initial energy is all rest mass since it's at rest. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments are such that one is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, that's important.

Wait, the nucleus was initially at rest, so the total momentum after fission must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. That means if one is more massive, it will have a lower speed than the lighter one. But since we're dealing with kinetic energy, I need to find out their speeds and then their kinetic energies, but using both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approaches.

The problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the T1 calculated classically. So I need to compute both and subtract them.

Let me break down what's given:

- Mass of initial nucleus: M.
- Rest-mass energy: 300 GeV → E_initial = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments:
   - Fragment 1: mass 2m (let's say the more massive one)
   - Fragment 2: mass m (the lighter one)
   - Sum of their masses: 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 ≈ 0.33 M.
   Wait, no, M is the initial mass. Wait, no—wait, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 ≈ 0.33 M. So fragment 2 is about 0.33 M, fragment 1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so total energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy should be the sum of the rest masses plus their kinetic energies. Oh, but in reality, mass might be converted into kinetic energy, so the total energy isn't conserved in the classical sense, but relativistically, energy and momentum are conserved.

But wait, the problem says to ignore electrons, so I don't have to worry about binding energy or anything like that. So it's just a matter of applying conservation of energy and momentum.

So, let me denote:

- Fragment 1 (more massive): mass m1 = 2m → 2*(0.33 M) ≈ 0.667 M.
Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum is 3m = 0.99 M, so m is 0.33 M, so m1 is 2m = 0.66 M, and m2 is 0.33 M.

So m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Because the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, but wait, in what way? Because momentum p is γmv, right? Since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, momentum isn't just mass times velocity.

So, the relativistic momentum for each fragment must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So,

p1 = γ1 m1 v1 = p2 = γ2 m2 v2

But since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal. So,

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use energy and momentum conservation together.

Let me think. The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. So,

E_total = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2)

But the initial energy was just M c² = 300 GeV. So,

(M c²) = (m1 c² + m2 c²) + (K1 + K2)

We know m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so m1 c² + m2 c² = 0.99 M c². Therefore,

300 GeV = 0.99 * 300 GeV + (K1 + K2)

Compute 0.99 *300 = 297 GeV. So,

300 = 297 + (K1 + K2) → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy released is 3 GeV.

But wait, that's a lot. Hmm, but maybe that's correct.

Now, using this, we can find the velocities and thus the kinetic energies.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to set up the conservation equations.

Let me denote:

p = momentum of fragment 1 (so fragment 2 has momentum -p)

For fragment 1:

Energy E1 = γ m1 c² = K1 + m1 c².

Similarly for fragment 2: E2 = γ m2 c² = K2 + m2 c².

So, from energy and momentum:

E1 + E2 = M c² = 300 GeV.

And,

p = γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But v1 and v2 are related through the momentum equations.

Hmm, perhaps I can express v1 and v2 in terms of p and masses.

Wait, but since p = γ m v, then v = p/(γ m). But that's a bit circular.

Alternatively, from the momentum conservation, the magnitudes are equal, so:

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the velocities are in opposite directions, but for the magnitudes, perhaps v1 = (γ2 m2 v2) / (γ1 m1).

Wait, maybe I should use the relationship between velocities and momenta.

Alternatively, I can square the energy expressions.

Because in relativity, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So for each fragment,

E1² = p² c² + (m1 c²)²,

E2² = p² c² + (m2 c²)².

Because the magnitudes of the momenta are the same (p and p for each), assuming each has momentum p and -p.

So,

E1² = p² c² + (m1 c²)^2,

E2² = p² c² + (m2 c²)^2.

Also, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Hmm, but this gives two equations with variables E1, E2, p.

Let me denote E1 = a, E2 = b.

So,

a + b = 300 GeV,

a² - (m1 c²)^2 = p² c²,

b² - (m2 c²)^2 = p² c².

Set the two expressions for p² c² equal:

a² - (m1 c²)^2 = b² - (m2 c²)^2.

So,

a² - b² = (m1² - m2²) c^4.

We can write this as (a - b)(a + b) = (m1² - m2²) c^4.

We already know that a + b = 300 GeV.

So,

(a - b)(300) = (m1² - m2²) c^4.

We can compute m1 and m2 in terms of M.

Earlier, m1 = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So,

m1² - m2² = ( (0.66 M)^2 - (0.33 M)^2 ) = M² (0.66² - 0.33²) = M² (0.4356 - 0.1089) = M² * 0.3267.

So,

a - b = [ (0.3267 M² c^4) ] / (300 GeV) )

Wait, but the units are a bit tricky. Let me make sure.

We have m1 and m2 in terms of M. So m1² - m2² is (0.66 M)^2 - (0.33 M)^2 = (0.66^2 - 0.33^2) M².

Which is 0.4356 M² - 0.1089 M² = 0.3267 M².

So,

a - b = [0.3267 M² c^4 ] / (300 GeV) )

But M c² is the initial rest energy, which is 300 GeV.

So,

M c² = 300 GeV → M c^4 = (300 GeV) * c².

Wait, no, no. Let's see:

Wait, M c² = 300 GeV → M c^4 = (300 GeV) * c².

But perhaps it's better to express M in terms of GeV/c².

Wait, M c² = 300 GeV → M = (300 GeV)/ c².

So,

m1² - m2² = 0.3267 * M² = 0.3267 * ( (300 GeV)/(c²) )².

So,

(m1^2 - m2^2) c^4 = 0.3267 * ( (300 GeV)^2 / c^4 ) * c^4 = 0.3267 * (300 GeV)^2.

So,

a - b = [0.3267 * (300)^2 GeV² ] / (300 GeV) ) = 0.3267 * 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV.

So,

a - b = 98.01 GeV.

We have a + b = 300 GeV,

a - b = 98.01 GeV.

Adding both equations:

2a = 398.01 GeV → a = 199.005 GeV.

Then,

b = 300 - a = 100.995 GeV.

So,

E1 = a = 199.005 GeV,

E2 = b = 100.995 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy for each fragment is:

K1 = E1 - m1 c²,

K2 = E2 - m2 c².

So,

K1 = 199.005 GeV - (0.66 M c²) → Wait, M c² = 300 GeV, so m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

Wait, no, m1 is 0.66 M, so m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

Similarly, m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So,

K1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.

K2 = 100.995 GeV - 99 GeV = 1.995 GeV = 1995 MeV.

Hmm, so the more massive fragment has a kinetic energy of about 1.005 GeV, and the lighter one 1.995 GeV.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right because the more massive fragment should have less kinetic energy than the lighter one. Because when a heavy object and a light object are moving with the same momentum, the lighter one has a higher speed, hence higher kinetic energy when considering relativistic effects. But in this case, the more massive fragment is moving slower, so its kinetic energy is less.

Wait, but according to the calculations, K1 is 1.005 GeV and K2 is 1.995 GeV. So, the more massive fragment has less kinetic energy than the lighter one, which makes sense.

But wait, the problem states that T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, so T1 is about 1.005 GeV, which is 1005 MeV.

But the question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation.

So I need to compute T1_classical, then find T1_correct - T1_classical.

Wait, but that depends on whether the classical approach gives a higher or lower value.

In the classical approach, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2, and since momentum is conserved, the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

Let me think: in the classical case, the initial momentum is zero, so after fission,

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

But since m1 = 2 m2,

v2 = 2 v1.

So, the velocities are v1 and 2 v1 in opposite directions.

The kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2.

Compute:

K1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2_classical = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1².

Since m1 = 2 m2,

K1_classical = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1²,

K2_classical = 2 m2 v1².

So,

K1_classical = m2 v1²,

K2_classical = 2 m2 v1².

So the total kinetic energy is K1 + K2 = 3 m2 v1².

But from energy conservation:

Initial energy is M c², but in classical mechanics, energy is conserved.

Wait, no. In classical mechanics, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and the final kinetic energy is the sum of the two fragments. However, in reality, the rest mass energy is converted into kinetic energy, so:

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2).

Wait, but in reality, the rest mass of the system is less than M, so the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass deficit. Hmmm, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Wait, no. If we're ignoring relativistic effects, then the total energy is not conserved in the same way. Because in reality, rest mass is converted into kinetic energy, but in classical mechanics, we might not account for that accurately.

Wait, perhaps in the classical approximation, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed by considering that the total kinetic energy is the same as the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

Wait, but the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, same as in the relativistic case.

Wait, that's interesting. So in both the classical and relativistic cases, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So, in the classical case, K1_classical = 1 GeV, K2_classical = 2 GeV. Because 3 GeV divided in the ratio of m2 : m1, which is 1:2.

Wait, no, because the ratio of K1 to K2 depends on the velocities.

Wait, earlier I got:

K1_classical = m2 v1²,

K2_classical = 2 m2 v1²,

so K1 : K2 = 1 : 2.

Total K = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

So,

K1_classical = m2 v1² = 1 GeV,

K2_classical = 2 GeV.

So, in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, T1 is about 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, that makes sense. So the correct T1 is 1005 MeV, the classical T1 is 1000 MeV. The difference is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 5 MeV higher than the classical approximation.

Wait, but which is bigger? The relativistic case gives a higher T1 than the classical? Wait, no, 1005 MeV is higher than 1000 MeV, so the relativistic T1 is higher by 5 MeV.

But wait, that's only a 0.5% increase. Hmm, but why is that?

Wait, another way to think about it: the relativistic calculation gave K1=1.005 GeV, K2=1.995 GeV.

So the more massive fragment has a kinetic energy of 1.005 GeV, and the lighter one 1.995 GeV.

In the classical case, the more massive fragment would have 1 GeV, the lighter one 2 GeV. So, the difference is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1005 MeV, the classical is 1000 MeV. The difference is 5 MeV. So the correct value is higher by 5 MeV.

But the question is, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1? So, 1005 - 1000 =5 MeV. So the correct T1 is higher by 5 MeV, so the difference is 5 MeV.

So the answer should be option B)5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and classical mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV and splits into two fragments. The more massive fragment (Fragment 1) has twice the mass of the lighter fragment (Fragment 2). The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. This leaves 3 GeV of energy to be distributed as kinetic energy between the two fragments.

### Relativistic Analysis
1. **Masses of Fragments**:  
   Let the mass of Fragment 2 be \( m_2 \). Then, the mass of Fragment 1 is \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).  
   Since \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), we find \( m_2 = 0.33M \) and \( m_1 = 0.66M \).  
   Converting to energy:  
   \[
   m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 198 \, \text{GeV}, \quad m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 99 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

2. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy after fission is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_1 c^2 + K_1 + m_2 c^2 + K_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:  
   \[
   K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission is zero. This implies the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal:  
   \[
   \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
   \]  
   Using relativistic energy-momentum relations, \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \), and solving for \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \), we find:  
   \[
   K_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}, \quad K_2 = 1.995 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   Thus, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is \( T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} = 1005 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Classical Approximation
In the classical case, kinetic energy is distributed inversely proportional to the masses of the fragments. Since \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), the kinetic energy ratio is \( K_1 : K_2 = 1 : 2 \). With a total kinetic energy of 3 GeV, we find:  
\[
K_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of Fragment 1 is:  
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1005 \, \text{MeV} - 1000 \, \text{MeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **B) 5 MeV**.
