Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The chemist has provided some information: mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. The options are four different compounds, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I'll break down each piece of information.

Starting with the mass spectrometry. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and is 100%, which suggests the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, so maybe there's a chlorine atom in the molecule? Because chlorine has a mass of about 35, and 158 -156 is 2, so that doesn't make sense. Wait, or perhaps there's a chlorine in the molecule and the molecular ion shows the main peak at 156. The peak at 158 could be a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 (about 75%) and Cl-37 (about 25%). So if the molecular ion is at 156 (which includes Cl-35), then the next peak would be Cl-37, which adds 2 to the mass. So 156 +2 would be 158. The abundance would be about 25% because Cl-37 is 25% of the natural abundance. But wait, the peak at 158 is 32%, which is a bit higher than 25%. Maybe there's more than one chlorine? Or perhaps it's not chlorine but another element. But looking at the options, some have chlorine.

Moving on to the IR data. The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretching, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 indicates a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone (which is around 1700-1750), but wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? No, wait, carboxylic acids usually have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1700 but broader. Alternatively, an ester or maybe an acid chloride? Acid chloride carbonyls are higher, maybe around 1800. 1720 is more like a possibly conjugated carbonyl, or maybe an ester or amide. But the broad peak suggests O-H, so maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the IR, the broad peak is in the 3500-2700 region. That region is typically for O-H (like in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids) or maybe an amine. But the sharp peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so probably a carboxylic acid (since they have O-H and carbonyl groups). Alternatively, maybe another functional group with O-H.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's look at the peaks:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a very downfield shift. Protons in that region are typically -OH (like in carboxylic acids) or aldehydic protons. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they can be broad. But this is a singlet at 11, so maybe it's an O-H in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Also, an aldehyde would typically be a triplet or a singlet depending on neighboring protons. Here, it's a singlet, so maybe only one proton. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but here it's a singlet. Hmm, wait, in the NMR, it's a singlet, but I'm not sure about the integration. Wait, the integration is given as 1H, so it's a single proton. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually a broad peak, but sometimes in DMSO or another solvent, it can be a sharp singlet. Or maybe it's a different environment.

Another peak is at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These look like aromatic protons. The fact that they are doublets suggests coupling with adjacent protons on the benzene ring. So let me think: if it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the structure is something like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Let me consider the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and CHO at position 1? Wait, but that's a benzaldehyde with substituents. The NMR would have an aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm, but in this case, the peak is at 11. So that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is at a different position.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4, and -COOH at position 1. So the benzoic acid. The NMR would have the COOH proton at around 10-12, which matches the 11.0 ppm. The aromatic protons would be in the para position relative to the Cl and COOH. So, for benzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 4 (assuming number 1 is COOH, 4 is Cl). Then the aromatic protons would be at 2 and 3, but wait, in para positions, the substituents are opposite each other. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), so the benzene ring has substituents at 1 and 4. So the H's would be at 2,3,5,6. But in the NMR, we have two doublets each for 2H. So maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene where the substituents are at 1 and 4. For example, if substituent A is at 1 and substituent B at 4, then the adjacent (ortho and para) protons would be in certain positions.

Wait, but 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have the Cl at 4 and COOH at 1. So the aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The H's at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (ortho to COOH and meta to Cl), and H's at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl). So in the NMR, you might see two doublets. Let me think about the splitting. Each proton would be adjacent to two others. For example, the H at 2 is adjacent to H at 3 and 6. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent has two H's on adjacent carbons. So if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the H's at 2 and 6 are next to substituent 1, and the H's at 3 and 5 are next to substituent 4.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The H's:

Positions 2 and 6: adjacent to COOH at 1. Since 2 and 6 are each next to 1, they are ortho to COOH. Position 3 and 5: adjacent to Cl at 4; they are ortho to Cl.

In such a case, the H's at 2 and 6 would each be next to a substituent. Let's say each H is a doublet because they are coupled with their adjacent H's. Let me explain: in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (like 1 and 4), the H's at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to substituent 1, and H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituent 4. Wait, but substituent 1 (COOH) is at position 1, so H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to it. Similarly, substituent 4 (Cl) is at position 4, so H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl.

But in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl.

In the NMR, the H's at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (because of symmetry), and the same for H's 3 and 5.

So the H at 2 would be next to H at 3 and 1. Wait, but substituent 1 is COOH, so H at 2 is adjacent to H at 3 and 1 (but 1 is a substituent, not an H). So H2 is adjacent to H3. Similarly, H6 is adjacent to H5.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think in terms of coupling. Each H is coupled with adjacent H's. So H2 is next to H3 and H1 (but H1 is substituent, so no coupling). So H2 only couples with H3. Similarly, H3 couples with H2 and H4 (but H4 is substituent Cl). So H3 only couples with H2. Wait, that can't be right because then H2 and H3 would be a doublet of doublets, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents at 1 and 4 cause the aromatic ring to have two sets of equivalent H's: H2 and H6 (each adjacent to COOH), and H3 and H5 (each adjacent to Cl). Each of these H's would be a doublet because they are next to one H. For example, H2 is next to H3, so each is a doublet. Similarly, H3 is next to H2 and H4 (Cl, no H), so perhaps H3 is a doublet as well.

Wait, but that would suggest two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So in the NMR, there would be two doublets: one integrating to 2H at higher ppm and another at lower. But looking at the given NMR, there are two doublets at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Which is higher? 8.02 is higher than 7.72. So which substituent would cause the H's to be upfield or downfield.

In aromatic rings, substituents can cause the chemical shifts of adjacent H's. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) like Cl and COOH de-shield the adjacent H's, making them appear downfield (higher ppm). So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield than the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Or wait, COOH is a strong EWG, Cl is a weaker EWG. So H's ortho to COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those ortho to Cl.

So in the NMR, the two doublets: the higher ppm (8.02) would be H2 and H6 (ortho to COOH), and the lower ppm (7.72) would be H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl). That matches the given NMR data.

So in the 1H NMR, the singlet at 11.0 is likely the COOH O-H proton. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H proton is usually broad, but sometimes in certain solvents like CDCl3, it can appear as a sharp peak. Alternatively, maybe it's exchange broadened. But the integration is 1H, which fits with a COOH group.

Now, looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure would fit the NMR, IR, and mass spec.

Wait, let me check the mass. Molecular formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding a Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight. Carbon:7×12=84, H:5×1=5, Cl:35.5, O:2×16=32. Total: 84+5+35.5+32= 156.5. So molecular weight around 156.5, which matches the m/z 156. The peak at 158 would be the Cl-37 isotope, which is about 25% abundance, but the question says 32%, which is a bit higher. But maybe in the mass spec, due to different factors, it's 32%.

Alternative option: option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me think about that. In that case, the substituents would be at position 2 (Cl) and 1 (COOH). The aromatic H's would be in a meta arrangement. Wait, but 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The H's would be in positions 3,4,5,6. But the symmetry might be different. Would that lead to two doublets each integrating to 2H? Let me think. If substituents are at 1 and 2, then the ring would have H's at 3,4,5,6. For H3, adjacent to substituents at 2 (Cl) and 4. H4 is adjacent to H3 and H5. H5 is adjacent to H4 and H6. H6 is adjacent to H5 and substituent 1 (COOH). Hmm, this might not give the same pattern as in the NMR. Let me see: maybe the H's in positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent, and H's 4 and 6 would be equivalent? Not sure. Alternatively, without drawing, it's hard to say, but I think the splitting would be more complex than two doublets. So perhaps option B is more likely.

Another option is option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Its structure is OCl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, that's not right. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-Ph. So the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Let me think about its spectral data. The IR would show a strong carbonyl peak, possibly around 1800 cm^-1 for the acid chloride. But the given IR is 1720, which is lower, more like an ester or maybe an amide, but not an acid chloride. So option C might be less likely because the carbonyl is lower than expected for an acid chloride.

Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure has Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and CHO at position 1. The aldehyde proton would typically be around 9-10 ppm, and might be a triplet if next to CH2, but here it's a singlet. Also, the IR would show a strong aldehyde peak around 2800-2700 (stretching) but the given IR shows a broad O-H and a sharp carbonyl. If it's an aldehyde, the O-H might be from a phenol group. The O-H of phenol is usually around 5 ppm as a broad peak, but in this case, the singlet is at 11 ppm, which is more consistent with carboxylic acid. So option A is less likely.

So, putting it all together, the IR has a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl (COOH), the NMR shows two doublets for aromatic protons (para substitution), and the molecular ion with Cl isotopes. So the structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. The peak at m/z = 158 (32%) indicates the presence of chlorine, as it corresponds to the Cl-37 isotope. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range, consistent with an O-H group, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), likely an O-H proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), indicative of aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains an aldehyde group, which typically appears as a sharp singlet around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR. However, the given spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H proton rather than an aldehyde. Additionally, the IR spectrum does not strongly support the presence of an aldehyde. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom at the para position on the benzene ring. The singlet at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR matches the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents, respectively. The IR spectrum supports the presence of both the O-H and carbonyl groups. The molecular weight of 156 g/mol aligns with the molecular ion peak, and the peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to the Cl-37 isotope. This option fits all the spectral data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   Phenyl chloroformate contains an acid chloride group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). The IR spectrum of an acid chloride typically shows a strong carbonyl peak around 1800 cm⁻¹, which is higher than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the ¹H NMR does not show the expected signals for the methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl. This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom at the ortho position on the benzene ring. The aromatic proton pattern in the ¹H NMR would differ significantly from the observed data, as the ortho substitution would lead to more complex splitting patterns. The given NMR data (two doublets integrating to 2H each) is more consistent with a para-substituted benzene, making this option unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR, and ¹H NMR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight, the IR spectrum supports the presence of a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR matches the expected aromatic proton pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.
