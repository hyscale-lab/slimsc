Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I remember that for angular momentum operators, the total operator P is the sum of the components multiplied by the respective unit vectors along direction n.

Right, the general form is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But direction n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n must be zero. So n lies in the x-z plane, which means n_y=0. So that simplifies the expression for P.

So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since the y-component is zero. But wait, the direction vector n should be a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me note that down.

Next, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I have to solve the equation:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

But first, let me write down the matrices for each component.

Given:
P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me substitute these matrices into P.

So P = (n_x * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me compute this. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Because when you add the two matrices, the (1,1) element is n_z*(1) + 0, the (1,2) element is n_x*(1) + 0, the (2,1) element is n_x*(1) + 0, and the (2,2) element is 0*(n_x) + (-n_z) *1.

Wait, wait:

Wait, P_x matrix has 0 and 1 in the first row. So when multiplied by n_x and ħ/2, the (1,1) element is 0, (1,2) is n_x *1*(ħ/2). Similarly, P_z matrix for (1,1) is 1, so when multiplied by n_z and ħ/2, that gives (ħ/2) n_z in (1,1).

So when adding P_x and P_z, the (1,1) element is (ħ/2) n_z, (1,2) is (ħ/2) n_x. Similarly, (2,1) is (ħ/2) n_x, and (2,2) is (ħ/2) (-n_z). So the matrix P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the matrix representation of P is (ħ/2) times that 2x2 matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, substituting P, we get:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]] * |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but |ψ> is a column vector, say [a, b]^T. So the equation is:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a,

n_x * a + (-n_z) * b = b.

So, two equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Hmm, since it's a homogeneous system, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. Alternatively, the system must have non-trivial solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Because then the eigenvectors would correspond to the eigenvalue 1 (since the equation is A ψ = ψ, where A is that matrix).

Wait, wait, no. The equation is A ψ = λ ψ, where λ is the eigenvalue. But in our case, the equation is A ψ = 1 * ψ because the equation is [n_z,n_x; n_x,-n_z] [a;b] = [a;b], so it's equivalent to A ψ = 1 * ψ.

So we're looking for the eigenvectors of matrix A = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues of A. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So det( [ [n_z - λ, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - λ ] ) = 0.

The determinant is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Expanding that: [-(n_z^2) - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ^2 ] - n_x^2 = 0.

Wait, the expansion:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = -(n_z)(n_z + λ) - λ (n_z + λ) = -n_z^2 - λ n_z - λ n_z - λ^2.

Wait, let me compute it as:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (-n_z)(n_z - λ) - λ (n_z - λ)

= -n_z^2 + λ n_z - λ n_z + λ^2

= -n_z^2 + 0 + λ^2.

So the determinant is (-n_z^2 + λ^2 ) - (n_x^2 ) = 0.

So:

λ^2 - n_z^2 - n_x^2 = 0.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 (because n is a unit vector), so substituting:

λ^2 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2) = λ^2 -1 =0 → λ^2=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So our eigenvectors correspond to λ=1 and λ=-1.

So for eigenvalue λ=1, the eigenvectors satisfy (A - I) |ψ> = 0.

So matrix A - I is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ].

The system is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Let me take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express a in terms of b.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the ratio a/b, assuming b ≠0.

From the first equation: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a/b = -n_x/(n_z -1).

Wait, but perhaps to express in terms of direction angles. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, that's in spherical coordinates. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis would be θ, so n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. But wait, wait, in the x-z plane, the direction is such that n_y=0, so the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but perhaps I should just use θ as the angle in x-z plane, so that n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ? Wait, no, that depends on how you orient it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express n in terms of an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the x-axis, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. But I'm a bit confused about the parametrization. Alternatively, perhaps the direction can be written as n = (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z²=1.

But perhaps it's easier to parametrize n as making an angle θ with the z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ. Because in that case, when θ=0, n is along z, and θ=90 degrees would be along x.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, wait: When θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the components would be n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But in our case, n lies in the x-z plane, so φ=0. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, that makes sense. So when θ=0, n is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), and when θ=90 degrees, n is along x (n_x=1, n_z=0).

So if I substitute n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ, then the matrix A becomes:

A = [[cosθ, sinθ],
     [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, the eigenvectors for λ=1.

So the equations become:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

From the first equation: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2).

So a = [ - sinθ / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b.

But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b = cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ].

We can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we can write this as [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ].

Alternatively, to make it simpler, perhaps normalize the vector.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So |a| = |cot(θ/2)|, |b|=1.

So normalization factor is sqrt( (cot^2(θ/2) ) + 1 ) = sqrt( csc^2(θ/2) ) ) = |csc(θ/2)|.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), 1 * sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because 1/csc(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so:

First component: [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

Second component: sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, this is for the eigenvalue λ=1. So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me recheck: I assumed n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, but perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, with n_x and n_z being the components. Let's say the angle from the z-axis is θ, then n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So when θ=0, along z, which makes sense.

So with that, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's one of the options.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the operator is for a muon. Oh, but the muon's spin is similar to an electron, so spin-1/2. So the eigenvector corresponds to spin up along direction n.

Wait, but the problem says to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, the normalized eigenvector we've found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the options include option C as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I've derived.

But wait, the options have 'B' as (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta), which might be for spherical coordinates with phi and theta angles. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So that would make option B (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which is different from what I have.

Hmm, but in the parametrization I used, the eigenvector's components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, another approach: since the direction n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x^2 + n_z^2=1.

But perhaps using a different parametrization, like theta being the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cos theta, n_z = sin theta.

Wait, that's another way. Let me try that.

So if n_x = cos theta, n_z = sin theta.

Then the matrix A becomes:

[[sin theta, cos theta],
 [cos theta, -sin theta]].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n_x is cos theta, and n_z is sin theta, then the matrix A is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] = [[sin theta, cos theta], [cos theta, -sin theta]].

So the eigenvalue equation is (A - I) |ψ> = 0.

So the equations are:

(sin theta - 1) a + cos theta * b = 0,

cos theta * a + (-sin theta -1) b =0.

From the first equation: a = [ - cos theta / (sin theta -1) ] * b.

But sin theta -1 = -(1 - sin theta) → so a = [ cos theta / (1 - sin theta) ] b.

Multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + sin theta):

a = [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ) / ( (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) ) ) ] b.

Denominator is 1 - sin^2 theta = cos^2 theta.

So a = [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ) / cos^2 theta ] b = [ (1 + sin theta) / cos theta ] b.

So a = (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b.

But (1 + sin theta)/cos theta = tan(theta/2 + pi/4) ? Hmm, perhaps using the identity.

Wait, (1 + sin theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the identity:

(1 + sin theta) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4) cos(theta/2 - pi/4), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, (1 + sin theta)/cos theta = tan(theta/2 + pi/4) → but perhaps it's better to express it in terms of theta/2.

Hmm, perhaps using the identity:

(1 + sin theta) = [ 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4) ]^2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express (1 + sin theta) as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4) * cos(theta/2 - pi/4). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express (1 + sin theta) as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]².

Wait, [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 = sin^2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) = 1 + sin theta.

Yes, exactly. So sqrt(1+sin theta) = sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2), but wait, that may not be necessary right now.

So, a = [ (1 + sin theta) / cos theta ] b.

Which can be written as [ (1 + sin theta) / cos theta ] = [ (1 + sin theta) ] / sqrt(1 - sin^2 theta) ].

But another approach is to write this ratio in terms of theta/2.

So,

(1 + sin theta) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2 → Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, using the identity:

(1 + sin theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4).

Wait, no, maybe it's better to write (1 + sin theta) = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2.

Yes, as I noted earlier.

So, (1 + sin theta) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.

And cos theta = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2)+ sin(theta/2)].

So,

(1 + sin theta)/cos theta = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2 ] / [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (sin + cos)^2.

Denominator: (cos - sin)(cos + sin) = cos^2 - sin^2.

So,

[ (sin + cos)^2 ] / (cos^2 - sin^2 ) = [ (sin + cos)^2 ] / [ (cos - sin)(cos + sin) ) ].

Which simplifies to (sin + cos)/(cos - sin) = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) ] / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ].

Which can be written as [ 1 + tan(theta/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(theta/2) ].

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to write this ratio as [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) ] / [ (1 - tan(theta/2)) ].

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should just proceed with the eigenvector.

So the vector is [ a, b ] = [ (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b, b ].

To normalize, we have |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So,

[ ( (1 + sin theta)^2 ) / cos^2 theta ) + 1 ] |b|^2 =1.

So,

|b| = 1 / sqrt( [ (1 + sin theta)^2 + cos^2 theta ] / cos^2 theta )

Simplify the numerator inside the sqrt:

(1 + 2 sin theta + sin^2 theta) + cos^2 theta = 1 + 2 sin theta + (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta ) = 1 + 2 sin theta +1 = 2(1 + sin theta).

So,

|b| = 1 / sqrt( 2(1 + sin theta) / cos^2 theta )

= sqrt( cos^2 theta ) / sqrt( 2(1+ sin theta) )

= |cos theta| / sqrt(2(1 + sin theta)).

But since theta is in the x-z plane, and assuming 0 < theta < pi, cos theta can be positive or negative.

Wait, perhaps I should evaluate this differently. Let's factor 1 + sin theta as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2.

So,

sqrt(2 (1 + sin theta)) = sqrt(2) [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ].

And cos theta = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].

So,

|b| = | [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] | / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

= |cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)| * [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

= |cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)| / sqrt(2).

So,

b = [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ] / sqrt(2).

And a = (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b.

But wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Another approach: since the eigenvector is [a, b], and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps the normalized eigenvector can be written in terms of theta/2.

Wait, earlier with the parametrization where n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta, the eigenvector was [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would fit. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think about normalization. The vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] has a magnitude of sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) =1, so it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $\hbar/2$ times specific $2 \times 2$ matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $y$-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and the operator simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (as $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector). Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}$, we solve:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix are $\pm 1$, and we are interested in the eigenvalue $+1$. Solving for the eigenvector, we find that the components of the eigenvector are proportional to:

\[
[a, b] \propto [\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)],
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$: This represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector for a direction in the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This includes incorrect normalization factors.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived from the eigenvalue equation.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I remember that for angular momentum operators, the total operator P is the sum of the components multiplied by the respective unit vectors along direction n.

Right, the general form is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But direction n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n must be zero. So n lies in the x-z plane, which means n_y=0. So that simplifies the expression for P.

So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since the y-component is zero. But wait, the direction vector n should be a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me note that down.

Next, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I have to solve the equation:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

But first, let me write down the matrices for each component.

Given:
P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me substitute these matrices into P.

So P = (n_x * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me compute this. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Because when you add the two matrices, the (1,1) element is n_z*(1) + 0, the (1,2) element is n_x*(1) + 0, the (2,1) element is n_x*(1) + 0, and the (2,2) element is 0*(n_x) + (-n_z) *1.

Wait, wait:

Wait, P_x matrix has 0 and 1 in the first row. So when multiplied by n_x and ħ/2, the (1,1) element is 0, (1,2) is n_x *1*(ħ/2). Similarly, P_z matrix for (1,1) is 1, so when multiplied by n_z and ħ/2, that gives (ħ/2) n_z in (1,1).

So when adding P_x and P_z, the (1,1) element is (ħ/2) n_z, (1,2) is (ħ/2) n_x. Similarly, (2,1) is (ħ/2) n_x, and (2,2) is (ħ/2) (-n_z). So the matrix P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the matrix representation of P is (ħ/2) times that 2x2 matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, substituting P, we get:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]] * |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but |ψ> is a column vector, say [a, b]^T. So the equation is:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a,

n_x * a + (-n_z) * b = b.

So, two equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Hmm, since it's a homogeneous system, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. Alternatively, the system must have non-trivial solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Because then the eigenvectors would correspond to the eigenvalue 1 (since the equation is A ψ = ψ, where A is that matrix).

Wait, wait, no. The equation is A ψ = λ ψ, where λ is the eigenvalue. But in our case, the equation is A ψ = 1 * ψ because the equation is [n_z,n_x; n_x,-n_z] [a;b] = [a;b], so it's equivalent to A ψ = 1 * ψ.

So we're looking for the eigenvectors of matrix A = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues of A. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So det( [ [n_z - λ, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - λ ] ) = 0.

The determinant is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Expanding that: [-(n_z^2) - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ^2 ] - n_x^2 = 0.

Wait, the expansion:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = -(n_z)(n_z + λ) - λ (n_z + λ) = -n_z^2 - λ n_z - λ n_z - λ^2.

Wait, let me compute it as:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (-n_z)(n_z - λ) - λ (n_z - λ)

= -n_z^2 + λ n_z - λ n_z + λ^2

= -n_z^2 + 0 + λ^2.

So the determinant is (-n_z^2 + λ^2 ) - (n_x^2 ) = 0.

So:

λ^2 - n_z^2 - n_x^2 = 0.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 (because n is a unit vector), so substituting:

λ^2 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2) = λ^2 -1 =0 → λ^2=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So our eigenvectors correspond to λ=1 and λ=-1.

So for eigenvalue λ=1, the eigenvectors satisfy (A - I) |ψ> = 0.

So matrix A - I is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ].

The system is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Let me take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express a in terms of b.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the ratio a/b, assuming b ≠0.

From the first equation: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a/b = -n_x/(n_z -1).

Wait, but perhaps to express in terms of direction angles. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, that's in spherical coordinates. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis would be θ, so n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. But wait, wait, in the x-z plane, the direction is such that n_y=0, so the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but perhaps I should just use θ as the angle in x-z plane, so that n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ? Wait, no, that depends on how you orient it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express n in terms of an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the x-axis, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. But I'm a bit confused about the parametrization. Alternatively, perhaps the direction can be written as n = (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z²=1.

But perhaps it's easier to parametrize n as making an angle θ with the z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ. Because in that case, when θ=0, n is along z, and θ=90 degrees would be along x.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, wait: When θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the components would be n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But in our case, n lies in the x-z plane, so φ=0. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, that makes sense. So when θ=0, n is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), and when θ=90 degrees, n is along x (n_x=1, n_z=0).

So if I substitute n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ, then the matrix A becomes:

A = [[cosθ, sinθ],
     [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, the eigenvectors for λ=1.

So the equations become:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

From the first equation: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2).

So a = [ - sinθ / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b.

But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b = cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ].

We can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we can write this as [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ].

Alternatively, to make it simpler, perhaps normalize the vector.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So |a| = |cot(θ/2)|, |b|=1.

So normalization factor is sqrt( (cot^2(θ/2) ) + 1 ) = sqrt( csc^2(θ/2) ) ) = |csc(θ/2)|.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), 1 * sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because 1/csc(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so:

First component: [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

Second component: sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, this is for the eigenvalue λ=1. So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me recheck: I assumed n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, but perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, with n_x and n_z being the components. Let's say the angle from the z-axis is θ, then n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So when θ=0, along z, which makes sense.

So with that, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's one of the options.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the operator is for a muon. Oh, but the muon's spin is similar to an electron, so spin-1/2. So the eigenvector corresponds to spin up along direction n.

Wait, but the problem says to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, the normalized eigenvector we've found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the options include option C as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I've derived.

But wait, the options have 'B' as (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta), which might be for spherical coordinates with phi and theta angles. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So that would make option B (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which is different from what I have.

Hmm, but in the parametrization I used, the eigenvector's components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, another approach: since the direction n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x^2 + n_z^2=1.

But perhaps using a different parametrization, like theta being the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cos theta, n_z = sin theta.

Wait, that's another way. Let me try that.

So if n_x = cos theta, n_z = sin theta.

Then the matrix A becomes:

[[sin theta, cos theta],
 [cos theta, -sin theta]].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n_x is cos theta, and n_z is sin theta, then the matrix A is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] = [[sin theta, cos theta], [cos theta, -sin theta]].

So the eigenvalue equation is (A - I) |ψ> = 0.

So the equations are:

(sin theta - 1) a + cos theta * b = 0,

cos theta * a + (-sin theta -1) b =0.

From the first equation: a = [ - cos theta / (sin theta -1) ] * b.

But sin theta -1 = -(1 - sin theta) → so a = [ cos theta / (1 - sin theta) ] b.

Multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + sin theta):

a = [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ) / ( (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) ) ) ] b.

Denominator is 1 - sin^2 theta = cos^2 theta.

So a = [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ) / cos^2 theta ] b = [ (1 + sin theta) / cos theta ] b.

So a = (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b.

But (1 + sin theta)/cos theta = tan(theta/2 + pi/4) ? Hmm, perhaps using the identity.

Wait, (1 + sin theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the identity:

(1 + sin theta) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4) cos(theta/2 - pi/4), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, (1 + sin theta)/cos theta = tan(theta/2 + pi/4) → but perhaps it's better to express it in terms of theta/2.

Hmm, perhaps using the identity:

(1 + sin theta) = [ 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4) ]^2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express (1 + sin theta) as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4) * cos(theta/2 - pi/4). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express (1 + sin theta) as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]².

Wait, [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 = sin^2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) = 1 + sin theta.

Yes, exactly. So sqrt(1+sin theta) = sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2), but wait, that may not be necessary right now.

So, a = [ (1 + sin theta) / cos theta ] b.

Which can be written as [ (1 + sin theta) / cos theta ] = [ (1 + sin theta) ] / sqrt(1 - sin^2 theta) ].

But another approach is to write this ratio in terms of theta/2.

So,

(1 + sin theta) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2 → Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, using the identity:

(1 + sin theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4).

Wait, no, maybe it's better to write (1 + sin theta) = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2.

Yes, as I noted earlier.

So, (1 + sin theta) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.

And cos theta = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2)+ sin(theta/2)].

So,

(1 + sin theta)/cos theta = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2 ] / [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (sin + cos)^2.

Denominator: (cos - sin)(cos + sin) = cos^2 - sin^2.

So,

[ (sin + cos)^2 ] / (cos^2 - sin^2 ) = [ (sin + cos)^2 ] / [ (cos - sin)(cos + sin) ) ].

Which simplifies to (sin + cos)/(cos - sin) = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) ] / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ].

Which can be written as [ 1 + tan(theta/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(theta/2) ].

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to write this ratio as [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) ] / [ (1 - tan(theta/2)) ].

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should just proceed with the eigenvector.

So the vector is [ a, b ] = [ (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b, b ].

To normalize, we have |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So,

[ ( (1 + sin theta)^2 ) / cos^2 theta ) + 1 ] |b|^2 =1.

So,

|b| = 1 / sqrt( [ (1 + sin theta)^2 + cos^2 theta ] / cos^2 theta )

Simplify the numerator inside the sqrt:

(1 + 2 sin theta + sin^2 theta) + cos^2 theta = 1 + 2 sin theta + (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta ) = 1 + 2 sin theta +1 = 2(1 + sin theta).

So,

|b| = 1 / sqrt( 2(1 + sin theta) / cos^2 theta )

= sqrt( cos^2 theta ) / sqrt( 2(1+ sin theta) )

= |cos theta| / sqrt(2(1 + sin theta)).

But since theta is in the x-z plane, and assuming 0 < theta < pi, cos theta can be positive or negative.

Wait, perhaps I should evaluate this differently. Let's factor 1 + sin theta as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2.

So,

sqrt(2 (1 + sin theta)) = sqrt(2) [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ].

And cos theta = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].

So,

|b| = | [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] | / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

= |cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)| * [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

= |cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)| / sqrt(2).

So,

b = [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ] / sqrt(2).

And a = (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b.

But wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Another approach: since the eigenvector is [a, b], and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps the normalized eigenvector can be written in terms of theta/2.

Wait, earlier with the parametrization where n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta, the eigenvector was [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would fit. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think about normalization. The vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] has a magnitude of sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) =1, so it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $\hbar/2$ times specific $2 \times 2$ matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $y$-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and the operator simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (as $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector). Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}$, we solve:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix are $\pm 1$, and we are interested in the eigenvalue $+1$. Solving for the eigenvector, we find that the components of the eigenvector are proportional to:

\[
[a, b] \propto [\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)],
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$: This represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector for a direction in the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This includes incorrect normalization factors.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived from the eigenvalue equation.

Answer: C
