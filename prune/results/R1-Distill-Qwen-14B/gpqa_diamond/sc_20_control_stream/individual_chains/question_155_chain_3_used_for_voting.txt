Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about the uncertainty in the Pz operator for a given quantum state. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue, and I'm given the explicit state vector. I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, I'll need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

First, let me write down the given information. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, that's a three-component vector. So the basis here is the eigenvectors of Pz. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, the matrix representation of Pz is diagonal, right? Because if you're in the eigenbasis of an operator, its matrix representation is diagonal with eigenvalues on the diagonal.

Looking at the matrix form of Pz provided, it's indeed diagonal. The first diagonal element is ħ, the second is 0, and the third is -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. That makes sense.

So the state vector is expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. Let me denote the state as |ψ⟩. The components are:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Compute |(-1/2)|² + |1/√2|² + |(-1/2)|² = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 equals 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ΔPz, I need to calculate ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

But wait, since |ψ⟩ is an eigenstate of Pz, right? Because the basis is its eigenbasis, so each component is an eigenstate. Wait, no. Hmm, wait no. The state given is an eigenstate of Px, not necessarily Pz. So it's a superposition of Pz's eigenstates.

Wait, the state is given as the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. So the state is not an eigenstate of Pz, which means that the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ will be some value, and the expectation of Pz squared will be higher because of the uncertainty.

So, let's proceed.

First, compute ⟨Pz⟩. 

The expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩.

Since Pz is a diagonal matrix, this can be computed as the sum of the components of |ψ⟩ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements of Pz, each multiplied by the complex conjugate of the component because it's a bra-ket product.

But wait, since Pz is diagonal, when you multiply |ψ⟩ by Pz, it's just scaling each component. So when you compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩, it's the sum over i of (ψ_i*) * (Pz)_ii * ψ_i.

So let me write down Pz:

Pz matrix is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So:

⟨Pz⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ), where a, b, c are the components of |ψ⟩.

Wait, wait, the state is:

a = -1/2 (first component)
b = 1/√2 (second component)
c = -1/2 (third component)

So |a|² is (1/2)² = 1/4.

|b|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|² is also 1/4.

So,

⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) * ħ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation of Pz is zero.

Now, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩. Since (Pz)^2 is just Pz squared, which is the same as each diagonal element squared.

So (Pz)^2 matrix is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, (−ħ)^2) → (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is the same calculation as ⟨Pz⟩, but with Pz squared.

⟨Pz²⟩ = |a|² * ħ² + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * ħ².

So substituting the values:

= (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the variance is ⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = (1/2) ħ².

The uncertainty ΔPz is the square root of the variance: sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ / sqrt(2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer. So the correct option is B.

Alternatively, I can double-check. Let me think about the process again.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨Pz²⟩ is to compute the expectation using the matrix. Alternatively, since Pz is diagonal, it's straightforward.

But let me think: Alternatively, perhaps the state is not in the eigenbasis of Pz, so perhaps I should compute it using the actual matrix multiplication. Wait, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation of Pz using the state vector.

But since Pz is diagonal, it's much easier to compute it as a sum of |ψ_i|^2 * Pz_ii, as I did earlier.

Wait, another sanity check: Since the state is an eigenstate of Px, but not of Pz, the expectation value of Pz is zero, which makes sense because it's symmetric in some way. For example, the state has components in the ±ħ eigenstates of Pz, and perhaps their contributions cancel.

Wait, the state is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's think about which Pz states it's in. The first component is the eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue ħ, the second is the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, and the third is eigenvalue -ħ.

So the state is a combination of the first and third Pz eigenstates, each with magnitude 1/2, and the second component is a larger 1/√2.

So when you calculate ⟨Pz⟩, each of the first and third components contribute (1/2)^2 * ħ and (1/2)^2 * (-ħ), which sum to zero. The middle component contributes zero because its eigenvalue is zero.

So indeed, ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Similarly, ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/2)^2 * (ħ)^2 + (1/2)^2 * (ħ)^2 = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So the variance is 1/2 ħ², so sqrt(1/2) ħ is the uncertainty, which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
