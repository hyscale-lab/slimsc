Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

So the scenario is about some genes in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done an experiment where they knocked out three genes: G1, G2, G3. They also made double knockouts (g1g2, etc.) and tested the resistance.

The results are as follows:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (super susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

The question is about what conclusions we can draw about the interactions of these genes. The options relate to which genes are transcription factors and the relationships between them.

So, I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a gene shows epistasis, it's downstream because the other gene affects its function. Also, if the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests that gene is epistatic.

Looking at the results, the single mutants:

g2 is the most affected; all plants get infected (0% resistance). So, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is lost completely. That suggests that G2 is critical. If you can't make G2's product, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

What about the double mutants?

g1g2 is 0%: same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2's function is downstream of G1, or that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because even when you knock out both, the phenotype is same as when only G2 is out. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So knocking out G3 along with G2 doesn't make it worse, which again suggests that G2 is downstream or epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So the double mutant is worse than either single. Hmm, that might mean that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and their combined knockout leads to more severe phenotype. But I'm not sure yet.

Also, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are usually upstream, regulating other genes. So which gene is that?

Looking at the data, G2's knockout completely eliminates resistance. So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor. Because if a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would prevent the expression of downstream genes, leading to a severe phenotype. So the loss of G2 would result in no resistance, meaning it's likely a regulatory gene, perhaps a transcription factor.

But wait, why is g3's resistance at 50%? That's lower than wild type but not zero. So when G3 is knocked out, plants are less resistant but not completely susceptible. Hmm.

Let me think about epistatic relationships.

In the case of g1g3: 10% resistance. So each single mutant has higher resistance (75% and 50%). So their double mutant is worse than either. That suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. Because when you knock out both, the effect is additive (or synergistic), leading to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. So, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways leading to resistance, their combined knockout would be more severe.

Alternatively, if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single mutant with the more severe phenotype. But in this case, each single mutant has a partial effect, and the double is much worse.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. But wait, what about their epistatic relationships?

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1.
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G3.
- g1g3: 10% (worse than both singles). So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but function in parallel.

So, G2 is a transcription factor, acting upstream of both G1 and G3. Because knocking out G2 would nullify both downstream pathways, leading to no resistance. Also, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways, which contribute to resistance.

So when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still use G3's pathway (since resistance is 75%). When G3 is knocked out, the plant can use G1's pathway (50% resistance). But when both are knocked out, no pathways are left, so resistance is 10% (much lower than either single).

So, the hierarchy is G2 (transcription factor) upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and each contributes to resistance but not entirely—so perhaps each is part of a redundant system or perhaps part of separate but additive systems.

Wait, so in the double mutants, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out (g1g2), it's the same as g2. So G2's knockout is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3.

So, that suggests that G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2's gene product is required for the function of both G1 and G3. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Wait, but in the first case, G1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but the plant still has some. That suggests that G1 is not the only gene contributing to resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, and G3 is another gene downstream, then when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still produce G3 via G2, leading to some resistance. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, the plant can still produce G1, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, but let's think about the possibilities. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3.

In that case:

- Without G2 (g2): can't activate G1 or G3. So no resistance. That's what the data shows.

- Without G1 (g1): G2 can activate G3. So maybe G3's product is enough for 75% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So the plant without G1 is less resistant than wild type, but not completely susceptible. So perhaps G3 is also involved, but perhaps it's not as effective as having both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 could be in parallel pathways, each contributing additively to resistance.

So, in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active, providing additive resistance. When G2 is knocked out, neither is active, so resistance is zero.

So, when G1 is knocked out (g1), only G3 is active, so resistance is 75% of wild type. When G3 is knocked out (g3), only G1 is active, giving 50% resistance. So each contributes a certain amount.

But why does g3 give 50%? Maybe G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. Or perhaps the two contribute in a way that G3 is more critical, so knocking it out leads to a bigger drop in resistance.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either single. So the contributions of G1 and G3 are additive, not redundant. So their functions add up. So without both, the resistance is the sum of their contributions. But the data shows that when you have neither, it's worse than either single. So they must contribute in some additive way.

Wait, but in the data, 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) would be 125% if additive, but that's not how it works. Hmm. Maybe it's not additive but complementary. Alternatively, perhaps each gene product is part of a redundant system.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway but are redundant. So if both are knocked out, the pathway is completely inactive. But that doesn't explain the single mutants being 75% and 50%.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So when you have G2, both pathways are active. But when G1 is knocked out, only G3's pathway is active, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, only G1's pathway gives 50% resistance. When both are knocked out, neither pathway works, so resistance is 10%. But why is that 10%? Maybe because there's another pathway, but not as effective.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10% is from some other mechanism not involving G1, G2, or G3. But the question says the three genes are the candidates, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, the 10% may be due to incomplete knockout of the genes, but I think that's unlikely.

So, to summarize:

- G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So it's a critical gene, probably a transcription factor upstream of others.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. G3's pathway contributes more (since g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%).

Wait, actually, when you knock out G3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when you knock out G1 (75%). So that suggests that G3 is more important than G1 in the resistance pathway. Because without G3, the plant is more susceptible.

So, G3's pathway contributes more to resistance than G1's. So, G3 is more critical.

But when you knock out both G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So combining the two has a bigger effect than either alone, which suggests they are in separate pathways.

So the hierarchy is G2 → both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance.

Now, the question is about the conclusions in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but our analysis suggests G2 is a transcription factor. So this option says G1 is the TF, which would conflict.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter doesn't make much sense. I'm not sure what that would imply. Maybe they are under the same regulation, but that's not clear. Also, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean G3 is downstream of G1. But our data shows that G2 is downstream of both, so I don't think that's correct.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1 is downstream. But our data shows that without G2, the resistance is zero, suggesting G2 is upstream. So perhaps this is not correct.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate for the other. But in our case, the single mutants have partial resistance, but the double mutant is much worse. So they don't compensate. That suggests they are not redundant, but perhaps in separate pathways. So this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant. Because if they were redundant, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant. For example, if G3 is more severe (g3 is 50%), then g1g3 would have 50% or worse. But 10% is much worse, so they're not redundant. So gene redundancy is probably not the case here.

So, going back to the options, the only one that matches is option A, but that claims G1 is the TF, which I don't think is right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's reevaluate.

The problem says that at least one is a TF upstream of others. So, G2's knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance. That suggests it's a transcription factor. Because if G2 were just another gene in a pathway, maybe knocking it out would not lead to zero resistance, unless it's a key regulatory gene.

So, G2 is likely the transcription factor. So in the options, the correct options are those where G2 is the TF.

Looking at the options, options A: G1 TF (incorrect), B: G2 TF (correct), C: G2 TF (correct), D: G2 TF (correct).

So, possible options are B, C, D.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. That would mean they are both regulated by the same promoter, but I don't see how that explains the data. Also, G3 is epistatic towards G1. If G3 is epistatic, then it would be downstream of G1. But with the data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So G3's knockout is worse. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G1.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of epistatic relationships.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of double mutant A B is the same as A. That is, gene A is downstream.

In our data:

g1g2 has the same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is downstream of G1 or in a pathway that G2 is dependent on G1. Wait, no, because in that case, G1 would be upstream. If G2 is downstream, and G1 is upstream, then knocking out G1 would affect G2's function. But in the double mutant, the resistance is same as G2, which is 0%. So maybe G1 is upstream of G2.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a TF that activates G1. So if G1 is knocked out, G2 can't activate G1, but G2 still activates G3. Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. So if G2 activates both G1 and G3, and G3 is more critical, then knocking out G1 (g1) would leave G3 active, providing 75% resistance. But wait, if G2 is a TF, then without G2, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So G2 must be upstream of both.

So in the double mutant g1g2, G2 is knocked out, so even if G1 is present, it's non-functional because G2 isn't there to activate it. So the resistance is the same as g2, which is 0%.

So G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

Now, what about the relationship between G1 and G3?

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1: 75% (so without G1, G2 is active so G3 is expressed, providing 75% resistance)

g3: 50% (without G3, G2 is active so G1 is expressed, providing 50% resistance)

So, G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. So, perhaps G3's pathway is more important.

In the double mutant, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant can't produce either, so resistance is very low (10%). So their functions are additive, not redundant.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

Now, looking at the epistatic relationships:

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, because in the double mutants (g1g2 and g3g2), the phenotype is same as g2.

As for G1 and G3, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single. So their effects are additive, which suggests that they function in parallel pathways, each contributing a part of the resistance.

So, in terms of the question, which conclusion can we draw?

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Not correct because G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter doesn't make sense. Also, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, it would resemble g3. But the data shows it's worse than either.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is if a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. As for G1 being epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1 is downstream.

But in our case, G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream but in separate pathways. So their epistatic relationships would not be applicable in the same way.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as we determined, G1 and G3 are not redundant since their double mutant is worse than either single.

Hmm, none of the options seem to perfectly fit, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are both regulated by G2. But their functions are additive. So when you lose G2, both are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. So that aligns.

In the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%, which is additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing a part.

So, which option aligns with this?

Looking again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But that would mean that either one of them can compensate. But the double mutant is worse, so they're not redundant.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but that can't be because G2 is the TF.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.

In the double mutants, the epistatic gene is the one that is 'downstream' because the other's effect is masked.

So, in g1g2: same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is downstream of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3: same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is downstream of G3.

Wait, that suggests that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. But if G2 is a transcription factor, that would imply that G2 is acting upstream of other genes, not downstream. So perhaps my initial assumption that G2 is the TF is incorrect.

Wait a minute, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream. So, G1 and G3 would be downstream of G2.

So, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. So, in the double mutant g1g2, the only way G2 is epistatic is if G2 is downstream of G1. But that would contradict G2 being a TF upstream.

Hmm, maybe I've got it the other way around.

Wait, let me think about what it means for a gene to be epistatic to another. Suppose gene A is epistatic to gene B. That means the pathway of gene A is downstream of gene B. So, if you have a mutant in gene B, the presence or absence of gene A won't change the phenotype. Because gene A is downstream.

Wait, no, more accurately, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of double mutant A and B is the same as A. So, the presence of a mutation in B doesn't affect the phenotype when A is already knocked out.

In our case, double mutant g1g2 has the same phenotype as g2. So, the presence of a mutation in G1 doesn't change the phenotype of g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. That suggests that G2 is downstream of G1.

Because if G2 is downstream, then knocking out G1 would not affect the function of G2. But in the data, g1g2 is same as g2, meaning that G2's function determines the phenotype regardless of G1.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream, activating other genes. So if G2's function is to activate G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would disable all downstream genes.

But in this case, when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still express G3, leading to 75% resistance. So G2 is not the TF; perhaps G1 is.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me try to make a pathway.

If G2 is downstream of G1, then G1 is a TF activating G2, which in turn activates other genes. So without G1, G2 isn't expressed, leading to no resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF upstream of G1 and G3. So, G2 activates both. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, leading to 0% resistance. When G1 is knocked out, G2 can still activate G3, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G2 can activate G1, leading to 50% resistance.

So that explains the single mutants.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: same as g2 (0%). Because without G2, G1 isn't expressed (assuming G1 is downstream of G2). So even if G1 is knocked out, G2 is already not functional, so same as g2.

g2g3: same as g2. Because G2 is knocked out, so G3 isn't expressed.

g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant can't produce either. But since G2 is active, perhaps G2 can activate some other gene, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the 10% is a residual resistance not involving G1 or G3.

But the problem states that these are the only candidate genes, so perhaps 10% is due to incomplete knockouts, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing part of the resistance. So when you knock out G1, G3 can still contribute some resistance (75%). When you knock out G3, G1 contributes 50%. When both are knocked out, neither contributes, leading to 10% (maybe another factor, but considering only these genes, perhaps it's a baseline).

So, based on this, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream in separate pathways.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2 is not the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter might not be relevant. Also, G3 being epistatic would mean its pathway is downstream of G1. But G2 is upstream of both.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is about multiple traits, which isn't directly addressed. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would resemble g1, but it's 10% which is worse than either.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is not supported, as the double mutant is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, G2 is epistatic to G1, but for G2 to be epistatic, it must be downstream. But G2 is the TF, so this can't be.

Option B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter: perhaps meaning they are co-regulated. But G3 being epistatic to G1 would mean G3 is downstream. But if G2 is the TF, G3's pathway is downstream.

But in the data, g3 (50%) is worse than g1 (75%), so G3's pathway is more critical than G1's. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, along with G1.

But how does that fit epistasis?

Hmm, perhaps in this setup, G3 is epistatic to G1 because G3's pathway is more critical. So in the presence of G3, G1's function is not needed. But that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1 because when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. But that doesn't directly imply epistasis.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key points from the data:

- G2 knockout leads to 0% resistance. So it's likely a transcription factor upstream.

- G1 knockout: 75% → G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, gives 75%.

- G3 knockout: 50% → G2 active, G1 expressed, gives 50%.

- G1 and G3 double mutant: 10% → much worse than either single.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways, each contributing to resistance.

Now, about epistasis:

- In g1g2, it's same as g2 → G2 is downstream of G1.

- In g3g2, same as g2 → G2 is downstream of G3.

Wait, that would imply that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, which would mean G2 is the last step in the pathway. But if G2 is a TF, it's upstream.

This is conflicting. So perhaps my initial assumption that G2 is the TF is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps G1 is the TF.

In that case:

- G1 is a TF, activates G2 and G3.

So, when G1 is knocked out, neither G2 nor G3 are expressed. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G3, and G1 is a TF that activates G2. No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, G1 is the TF, and G3 is downstream of G1, and G2 is something else.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to match the options.

Option C says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I don't see how that applies here. Also, G1 being epistatic to G3 would mean that G1 is downstream. But in our data, G2 is the likely TF upstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways downstream, each contributes, and their combined knockout gives additive effects.

So, looking for the option that says G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (possibly additive), and G2 is epistatic to both.

Which option aligns with that?

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → correct.

But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic to G1 → maybe.

But in our data, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, in separate pathways. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are additive in their contributions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter → Not sure about that. Also, G3 is epistatic to G1 → which would mean G3 is downstream.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy → no. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3 → which would mean G1 is downstream.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy → but their double mutant is worse, so no redundancy.

Hmm. None of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps the best fit is option A, but that's not possible because G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps I have to re-examine the options.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But in our data, it's worse than both, so that can't be.

So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about G2 being the TF. Let's consider that G3 is the TF.

If G3 is the TF, then knocking it out would lead to 50% resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, and g2 is 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1 is the TF. Then, knocking it out would lead to lower resistance, but in g1, it's 75%, which is better than g2's 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the double mutants.

Only in the double mutants where G2 is knocked out (g1g2, g2g3) do we see 0% resistance. So G2 is necessary for resistance, and it's likely a regulatory gene.

So, G2 is likely the TF. So the only options with G2 as TF are B, C, D.

Among these, the correct conclusion must involve G2 being the TF.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g3. But our data shows it's worse, so this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, G1 being epistatic to G3 would imply g1g3 would resemble g1. But it's worse, so no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is not supported. So none fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I must have made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is epistatic to both.

But in that case, the double mutant g1g3 wouldn't be worse than either single, unless they are in separate pathways.

But the data shows g1g3 is worse, so they are in separate pathways.

So, the correct conclusion is:

G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again, the only one where G2 is the TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 is option A. But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each option implies.

Option A: G1 is a TF, which is incorrect because G2's knockout is more severe. So Option A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulatory region, perhaps same TF binding). G3 is epistatic towards G1. So G3 is downstream of G1.

But G2 is the TF, so it's upstream. So G2 activates G1 and G3.

If G3 is downstream of G1, then knocking out G1 would allow G3 to function. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%.

So, perhaps G1's pathway contributes more to resistance.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single.

If G3 is downstream of G1, then in g1g3, G3 is not functional, but G1 is. But g1g3 is more susceptible than g3, which has 50% resistance. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option implies for the double mutants.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in g1g3, the phenotype would be like g1 (75%). But the data shows 10%, so that's not fitting.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the worse of the two singles. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than both.

So, none fit, but the only option that states G2 is the TF is B, C, D.

Looking again, perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question is which conclusion can you draw. Perhaps the key is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, with G2 epistatic to both.

In the options, the only one that says G2 is TF and G2 is epistatic is option A, but that's wrong.

Wait, no. Looking again, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that is correct. But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong.

So perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm misreading it.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G2 is epistatic towards G1, that implies G2 is downstream of G1. So G1 is upstream, G2 is downstream.

If G1 is the TF, and G2 is downstream (so G1 activates G2), but then in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So if G1 is the TF, and G2 is downstream, then knocking out G1 would prevent G2 from being expressed. But in data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. So that can't be.

So, no, option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but perhaps I should go with the option that best fits the data, which is option A is wrong, so the correct answer is option A isn't correct, so the correct is option C.

Wait, no. Let me try to think of which option correctly states that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

But none of the options directly state that.

Wait, perhaps the only correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, only option A mentions G2 being epistatic towards G1. But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the TF issue.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but considering that G2 is the TF, the correct answer is none of the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the answer as option A is incorrect, and the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I don't see how pleiotropy comes into play.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as we saw, the double mutant isn't redundant, so this doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the effect of the double mutants again.

The double mutants g1g3 has resistance 10%. Which is much lower than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So the combined effect is more severe than either. That suggests that G1 and G3 are working in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, their functions are additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing additively to resistance.

Looking for an option that says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. But the options don't mention that explicitly.

Wait, perhaps option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, which isn't directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: think about the epistatic relationships.

Since g1g2 has same as g2, G2 is epistatic to G1 → G2 is downstream.

Similarly, g3g2 same as g2 → G2 is downstream of G3.

So, G2 is a common downstream component of both G1 and G3 pathways.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Since G2 is downstream, it can't be a transcription factor. Because transcription factors are upstream.

Wait, that changes everything. I think I made a mistake earlier.

If G2 is downstream, it's not a TF. So the TF must be upstream of G2.

So, the TF is upstream of G2, which in turn is downstream of the TF.

In that case, the TF could be G1 or G3.

But the data shows that G2's knockout is the most severe, so perhaps G2 is in a critical pathway.

But this is getting too confusing. I think I should give up and make a guess.

But given the data, the best conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream, in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking for the option that says G2 is a TF. So options B, C, D.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy isn't supported.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would imply same regulation, but I'm not sure. If G3 is epistatic, that would mean G3 is downstream.

But G2 is TF, so it's upstream of both.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is option C.

But I'm really not confident. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is option A is wrong, and the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and G2 is epistatic to both. Among the options, the only one that says G2 is the TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 is option A, but that says G1 is the TF. So that's wrong.

Another possibility: none of the options fit, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But in this case, G2 is downstream, which would make it not a TF. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is downstream, and the TF is G1.

But that contradicts the data.

I think I'm stuck and should try to proceed.

The experiment investigates the role of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The results of single and double mutants provide insights into their interactions:

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (better than g2 and g3).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (more susceptible than g1).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).

3. **Conclusion from Data**:
   - **G2 is critical**: Knocking out G2 results in complete susceptibility (0% resistance), suggesting it is likely a transcription factor (TF) upstream of other genes.
   - **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both resemble g2, indicating G2 is downstream of G1 and G3.
   - **G1 and G3 are in separate pathways**: The double mutant g1g3 has resistance (10%) worse than either single mutant, indicating their contributions are additive rather than redundant.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States G1 is the TF, which contradicts the data showing G2 is critical (0% resistance in g2). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: States G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. While G2 being the TF aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data, as g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.
- **Option C**: States G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is not evident in the data, and G1 being epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the g1g3 result (10% resistance, worse than either single mutant).
- **Option D**: States G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Gene redundancy is not supported, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data.

### Final Conclusion:
The data strongly support that G2 is the TF upstream of G1 and G3, which function in separate pathways contributing additively to resistance. However, none of the options perfectly align with this conclusion. Among the given options, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, even though the other claims are not fully supported.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

So the scenario is about some genes in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done an experiment where they knocked out three genes: G1, G2, G3. They also made double knockouts (g1g2, etc.) and tested the resistance.

The results are as follows:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (super susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

The question is about what conclusions we can draw about the interactions of these genes. The options relate to which genes are transcription factors and the relationships between them.

So, I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a gene shows epistasis, it's downstream because the other gene affects its function. Also, if the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests that gene is epistatic.

Looking at the results, the single mutants:

g2 is the most affected; all plants get infected (0% resistance). So, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is lost completely. That suggests that G2 is critical. If you can't make G2's product, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

What about the double mutants?

g1g2 is 0%: same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2's function is downstream of G1, or that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because even when you knock out both, the phenotype is same as when only G2 is out. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So knocking out G3 along with G2 doesn't make it worse, which again suggests that G2 is downstream or epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So the double mutant is worse than either single. Hmm, that might mean that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and their combined knockout leads to more severe phenotype. But I'm not sure yet.

Also, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are usually upstream, regulating other genes. So which gene is that?

Looking at the data, G2's knockout completely eliminates resistance. So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor. Because if a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would prevent the expression of downstream genes, leading to a severe phenotype. So the loss of G2 would result in no resistance, meaning it's likely a regulatory gene, perhaps a transcription factor.

But wait, why is g3's resistance at 50%? That's lower than wild type but not zero. So when G3 is knocked out, plants are less resistant but not completely susceptible. Hmm.

Let me think about epistatic relationships.

In the case of g1g3: 10% resistance. So each single mutant has higher resistance (75% and 50%). So their double mutant is worse than either. That suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. Because when you knock out both, the effect is additive (or synergistic), leading to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. So, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways leading to resistance, their combined knockout would be more severe.

Alternatively, if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single mutant with the more severe phenotype. But in this case, each single mutant has a partial effect, and the double is much worse.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. But wait, what about their epistatic relationships?

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1.
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G3.
- g1g3: 10% (worse than both singles). So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but function in parallel.

So, G2 is a transcription factor, acting upstream of both G1 and G3. Because knocking out G2 would nullify both downstream pathways, leading to no resistance. Also, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways, which contribute to resistance.

So when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still use G3's pathway (since resistance is 75%). When G3 is knocked out, the plant can use G1's pathway (50% resistance). But when both are knocked out, no pathways are left, so resistance is 10% (much lower than either single).

So, the hierarchy is G2 (transcription factor) upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and each contributes to resistance but not entirely—so perhaps each is part of a redundant system or perhaps part of separate but additive systems.

Wait, so in the double mutants, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out (g1g2), it's the same as g2. So G2's knockout is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3.

So, that suggests that G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2's gene product is required for the function of both G1 and G3. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Wait, but in the first case, G1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but the plant still has some. That suggests that G1 is not the only gene contributing to resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, and G3 is another gene downstream, then when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still produce G3 via G2, leading to some resistance. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, the plant can still produce G1, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, but let's think about the possibilities. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3.

In that case:

- Without G2 (g2): can't activate G1 or G3. So no resistance. That's what the data shows.

- Without G1 (g1): G2 can activate G3. So maybe G3's product is enough for 75% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So the plant without G1 is less resistant than wild type, but not completely susceptible. So perhaps G3 is also involved, but perhaps it's not as effective as having both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 could be in parallel pathways, each contributing additively to resistance.

So, in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active, providing additive resistance. When G2 is knocked out, neither is active, so resistance is zero.

So, when G1 is knocked out (g1), only G3 is active, so resistance is 75% of wild type. When G3 is knocked out (g3), only G1 is active, giving 50% resistance. So each contributes a certain amount.

But why does g3 give 50%? Maybe G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. Or perhaps the two contribute in a way that G3 is more critical, so knocking it out leads to a bigger drop in resistance.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either single. So the contributions of G1 and G3 are additive, not redundant. So their functions add up. So without both, the resistance is the sum of their contributions. But the data shows that when you have neither, it's worse than either single. So they must contribute in some additive way.

Wait, but in the data, 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) would be 125% if additive, but that's not how it works. Hmm. Maybe it's not additive but complementary. Alternatively, perhaps each gene product is part of a redundant system.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway but are redundant. So if both are knocked out, the pathway is completely inactive. But that doesn't explain the single mutants being 75% and 50%.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So when you have G2, both pathways are active. But when G1 is knocked out, only G3's pathway is active, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, only G1's pathway gives 50% resistance. When both are knocked out, neither pathway works, so resistance is 10%. But why is that 10%? Maybe because there's another pathway, but not as effective.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10% is from some other mechanism not involving G1, G2, or G3. But the question says the three genes are the candidates, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, the 10% may be due to incomplete knockout of the genes, but I think that's unlikely.

So, to summarize:

- G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So it's a critical gene, probably a transcription factor upstream of others.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. G3's pathway contributes more (since g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%).

Wait, actually, when you knock out G3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when you knock out G1 (75%). So that suggests that G3 is more important than G1 in the resistance pathway. Because without G3, the plant is more susceptible.

So, G3's pathway contributes more to resistance than G1's. So, G3 is more critical.

But when you knock out both G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So combining the two has a bigger effect than either alone, which suggests they are in separate pathways.

So the hierarchy is G2 → both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance.

Now, the question is about the conclusions in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but our analysis suggests G2 is a transcription factor. So this option says G1 is the TF, which would conflict.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter doesn't make much sense. I'm not sure what that would imply. Maybe they are under the same regulation, but that's not clear. Also, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean G3 is downstream of G1. But our data shows that G2 is downstream of both, so I don't think that's correct.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1 is downstream. But our data shows that without G2, the resistance is zero, suggesting G2 is upstream. So perhaps this is not correct.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate for the other. But in our case, the single mutants have partial resistance, but the double mutant is much worse. So they don't compensate. That suggests they are not redundant, but perhaps in separate pathways. So this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant. Because if they were redundant, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant. For example, if G3 is more severe (g3 is 50%), then g1g3 would have 50% or worse. But 10% is much worse, so they're not redundant. So gene redundancy is probably not the case here.

So, going back to the options, the only one that matches is option A, but that claims G1 is the TF, which I don't think is right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's reevaluate.

The problem says that at least one is a TF upstream of others. So, G2's knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance. That suggests it's a transcription factor. Because if G2 were just another gene in a pathway, maybe knocking it out would not lead to zero resistance, unless it's a key regulatory gene.

So, G2 is likely the transcription factor. So in the options, the correct options are those where G2 is the TF.

Looking at the options, options A: G1 TF (incorrect), B: G2 TF (correct), C: G2 TF (correct), D: G2 TF (correct).

So, possible options are B, C, D.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. That would mean they are both regulated by the same promoter, but I don't see how that explains the data. Also, G3 is epistatic towards G1. If G3 is epistatic, then it would be downstream of G1. But with the data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So G3's knockout is worse. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G1.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of epistatic relationships.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of double mutant A B is the same as A. That is, gene A is downstream.

In our data:

g1g2 has the same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is downstream of G1 or in a pathway that G2 is dependent on G1. Wait, no, because in that case, G1 would be upstream. If G2 is downstream, and G1 is upstream, then knocking out G1 would affect G2's function. But in the double mutant, the resistance is same as G2, which is 0%. So maybe G1 is upstream of G2.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a TF that activates G1. So if G1 is knocked out, G2 can't activate G1, but G2 still activates G3. Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. So if G2 activates both G1 and G3, and G3 is more critical, then knocking out G1 (g1) would leave G3 active, providing 75% resistance. But wait, if G2 is a TF, then without G2, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So G2 must be upstream of both.

So in the double mutant g1g2, G2 is knocked out, so even if G1 is present, it's non-functional because G2 isn't there to activate it. So the resistance is the same as g2, which is 0%.

So G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

Now, what about the relationship between G1 and G3?

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1: 75% (so without G1, G2 is active so G3 is expressed, providing 75% resistance)

g3: 50% (without G3, G2 is active so G1 is expressed, providing 50% resistance)

So, G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. So, perhaps G3's pathway is more important.

In the double mutant, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant can't produce either, so resistance is very low (10%). So their functions are additive, not redundant.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

Now, looking at the epistatic relationships:

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, because in the double mutants (g1g2 and g3g2), the phenotype is same as g2.

As for G1 and G3, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single. So their effects are additive, which suggests that they function in parallel pathways, each contributing a part of the resistance.

So, in terms of the question, which conclusion can we draw?

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Not correct because G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter doesn't make sense. Also, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, it would resemble g3. But the data shows it's worse than either.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is if a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. As for G1 being epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1 is downstream.

But in our case, G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream but in separate pathways. So their epistatic relationships would not be applicable in the same way.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as we determined, G1 and G3 are not redundant since their double mutant is worse than either single.

Hmm, none of the options seem to perfectly fit, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are both regulated by G2. But their functions are additive. So when you lose G2, both are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. So that aligns.

In the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%, which is additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing a part.

So, which option aligns with this?

Looking again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But that would mean that either one of them can compensate. But the double mutant is worse, so they're not redundant.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but that can't be because G2 is the TF.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.

In the double mutants, the epistatic gene is the one that is 'downstream' because the other's effect is masked.

So, in g1g2: same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is downstream of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3: same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is downstream of G3.

Wait, that suggests that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. But if G2 is a transcription factor, that would imply that G2 is acting upstream of other genes, not downstream. So perhaps my initial assumption that G2 is the TF is incorrect.

Wait a minute, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream. So, G1 and G3 would be downstream of G2.

So, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. So, in the double mutant g1g2, the only way G2 is epistatic is if G2 is downstream of G1. But that would contradict G2 being a TF upstream.

Hmm, maybe I've got it the other way around.

Wait, let me think about what it means for a gene to be epistatic to another. Suppose gene A is epistatic to gene B. That means the pathway of gene A is downstream of gene B. So, if you have a mutant in gene B, the presence or absence of gene A won't change the phenotype. Because gene A is downstream.

Wait, no, more accurately, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of double mutant A and B is the same as A. So, the presence of a mutation in B doesn't affect the phenotype when A is already knocked out.

In our case, double mutant g1g2 has the same phenotype as g2. So, the presence of a mutation in G1 doesn't change the phenotype of g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. That suggests that G2 is downstream of G1.

Because if G2 is downstream, then knocking out G1 would not affect the function of G2. But in the data, g1g2 is same as g2, meaning that G2's function determines the phenotype regardless of G1.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream, activating other genes. So if G2's function is to activate G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would disable all downstream genes.

But in this case, when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still express G3, leading to 75% resistance. So G2 is not the TF; perhaps G1 is.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me try to make a pathway.

If G2 is downstream of G1, then G1 is a TF activating G2, which in turn activates other genes. So without G1, G2 isn't expressed, leading to no resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF upstream of G1 and G3. So, G2 activates both. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, leading to 0% resistance. When G1 is knocked out, G2 can still activate G3, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G2 can activate G1, leading to 50% resistance.

So that explains the single mutants.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: same as g2 (0%). Because without G2, G1 isn't expressed (assuming G1 is downstream of G2). So even if G1 is knocked out, G2 is already not functional, so same as g2.

g2g3: same as g2. Because G2 is knocked out, so G3 isn't expressed.

g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant can't produce either. But since G2 is active, perhaps G2 can activate some other gene, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the 10% is a residual resistance not involving G1 or G3.

But the problem states that these are the only candidate genes, so perhaps 10% is due to incomplete knockouts, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing part of the resistance. So when you knock out G1, G3 can still contribute some resistance (75%). When you knock out G3, G1 contributes 50%. When both are knocked out, neither contributes, leading to 10% (maybe another factor, but considering only these genes, perhaps it's a baseline).

So, based on this, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream in separate pathways.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2 is not the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter might not be relevant. Also, G3 being epistatic would mean its pathway is downstream of G1. But G2 is upstream of both.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is about multiple traits, which isn't directly addressed. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would resemble g1, but it's 10% which is worse than either.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is not supported, as the double mutant is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, G2 is epistatic to G1, but for G2 to be epistatic, it must be downstream. But G2 is the TF, so this can't be.

Option B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter: perhaps meaning they are co-regulated. But G3 being epistatic to G1 would mean G3 is downstream. But if G2 is the TF, G3's pathway is downstream.

But in the data, g3 (50%) is worse than g1 (75%), so G3's pathway is more critical than G1's. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, along with G1.

But how does that fit epistasis?

Hmm, perhaps in this setup, G3 is epistatic to G1 because G3's pathway is more critical. So in the presence of G3, G1's function is not needed. But that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1 because when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. But that doesn't directly imply epistasis.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key points from the data:

- G2 knockout leads to 0% resistance. So it's likely a transcription factor upstream.

- G1 knockout: 75% → G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, gives 75%.

- G3 knockout: 50% → G2 active, G1 expressed, gives 50%.

- G1 and G3 double mutant: 10% → much worse than either single.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways, each contributing to resistance.

Now, about epistasis:

- In g1g2, it's same as g2 → G2 is downstream of G1.

- In g3g2, same as g2 → G2 is downstream of G3.

Wait, that would imply that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, which would mean G2 is the last step in the pathway. But if G2 is a TF, it's upstream.

This is conflicting. So perhaps my initial assumption that G2 is the TF is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps G1 is the TF.

In that case:

- G1 is a TF, activates G2 and G3.

So, when G1 is knocked out, neither G2 nor G3 are expressed. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G3, and G1 is a TF that activates G2. No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, G1 is the TF, and G3 is downstream of G1, and G2 is something else.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to match the options.

Option C says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I don't see how that applies here. Also, G1 being epistatic to G3 would mean that G1 is downstream. But in our data, G2 is the likely TF upstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways downstream, each contributes, and their combined knockout gives additive effects.

So, looking for the option that says G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (possibly additive), and G2 is epistatic to both.

Which option aligns with that?

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → correct.

But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic to G1 → maybe.

But in our data, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, in separate pathways. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are additive in their contributions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter → Not sure about that. Also, G3 is epistatic to G1 → which would mean G3 is downstream.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy → no. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3 → which would mean G1 is downstream.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy → but their double mutant is worse, so no redundancy.

Hmm. None of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps the best fit is option A, but that's not possible because G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps I have to re-examine the options.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But in our data, it's worse than both, so that can't be.

So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about G2 being the TF. Let's consider that G3 is the TF.

If G3 is the TF, then knocking it out would lead to 50% resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, and g2 is 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1 is the TF. Then, knocking it out would lead to lower resistance, but in g1, it's 75%, which is better than g2's 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the double mutants.

Only in the double mutants where G2 is knocked out (g1g2, g2g3) do we see 0% resistance. So G2 is necessary for resistance, and it's likely a regulatory gene.

So, G2 is likely the TF. So the only options with G2 as TF are B, C, D.

Among these, the correct conclusion must involve G2 being the TF.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g3. But our data shows it's worse, so this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, G1 being epistatic to G3 would imply g1g3 would resemble g1. But it's worse, so no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is not supported. So none fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I must have made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is epistatic to both.

But in that case, the double mutant g1g3 wouldn't be worse than either single, unless they are in separate pathways.

But the data shows g1g3 is worse, so they are in separate pathways.

So, the correct conclusion is:

G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again, the only one where G2 is the TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 is option A. But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each option implies.

Option A: G1 is a TF, which is incorrect because G2's knockout is more severe. So Option A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulatory region, perhaps same TF binding). G3 is epistatic towards G1. So G3 is downstream of G1.

But G2 is the TF, so it's upstream. So G2 activates G1 and G3.

If G3 is downstream of G1, then knocking out G1 would allow G3 to function. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%.

So, perhaps G1's pathway contributes more to resistance.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single.

If G3 is downstream of G1, then in g1g3, G3 is not functional, but G1 is. But g1g3 is more susceptible than g3, which has 50% resistance. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option implies for the double mutants.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in g1g3, the phenotype would be like g1 (75%). But the data shows 10%, so that's not fitting.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the worse of the two singles. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than both.

So, none fit, but the only option that states G2 is the TF is B, C, D.

Looking again, perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question is which conclusion can you draw. Perhaps the key is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, with G2 epistatic to both.

In the options, the only one that says G2 is TF and G2 is epistatic is option A, but that's wrong.

Wait, no. Looking again, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that is correct. But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong.

So perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm misreading it.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G2 is epistatic towards G1, that implies G2 is downstream of G1. So G1 is upstream, G2 is downstream.

If G1 is the TF, and G2 is downstream (so G1 activates G2), but then in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So if G1 is the TF, and G2 is downstream, then knocking out G1 would prevent G2 from being expressed. But in data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. So that can't be.

So, no, option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but perhaps I should go with the option that best fits the data, which is option A is wrong, so the correct answer is option A isn't correct, so the correct is option C.

Wait, no. Let me try to think of which option correctly states that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

But none of the options directly state that.

Wait, perhaps the only correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, only option A mentions G2 being epistatic towards G1. But option A says G1 is the TF, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the TF issue.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but considering that G2 is the TF, the correct answer is none of the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the answer as option A is incorrect, and the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I don't see how pleiotropy comes into play.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as we saw, the double mutant isn't redundant, so this doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the effect of the double mutants again.

The double mutants g1g3 has resistance 10%. Which is much lower than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So the combined effect is more severe than either. That suggests that G1 and G3 are working in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, their functions are additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing additively to resistance.

Looking for an option that says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. But the options don't mention that explicitly.

Wait, perhaps option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, which isn't directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: think about the epistatic relationships.

Since g1g2 has same as g2, G2 is epistatic to G1 → G2 is downstream.

Similarly, g3g2 same as g2 → G2 is downstream of G3.

So, G2 is a common downstream component of both G1 and G3 pathways.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Since G2 is downstream, it can't be a transcription factor. Because transcription factors are upstream.

Wait, that changes everything. I think I made a mistake earlier.

If G2 is downstream, it's not a TF. So the TF must be upstream of G2.

So, the TF is upstream of G2, which in turn is downstream of the TF.

In that case, the TF could be G1 or G3.

But the data shows that G2's knockout is the most severe, so perhaps G2 is in a critical pathway.

But this is getting too confusing. I think I should give up and make a guess.

But given the data, the best conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream, in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking for the option that says G2 is a TF. So options B, C, D.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy isn't supported.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would imply same regulation, but I'm not sure. If G3 is epistatic, that would mean G3 is downstream.

But G2 is TF, so it's upstream of both.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is option C.

But I'm really not confident. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is option A is wrong, and the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and G2 is epistatic to both. Among the options, the only one that says G2 is the TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 is option A, but that says G1 is the TF. So that's wrong.

Another possibility: none of the options fit, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But in this case, G2 is downstream, which would make it not a TF. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is downstream, and the TF is G1.

But that contradicts the data.

I think I'm stuck and should try to proceed.


The experiment investigates the role of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The results of single and double mutants provide insights into their interactions:

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (better than g2 and g3).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (more susceptible than g1).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).

3. **Conclusion from Data**:
   - **G2 is critical**: Knocking out G2 results in complete susceptibility (0% resistance), suggesting it is likely a transcription factor (TF) upstream of other genes.
   - **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both resemble g2, indicating G2 is downstream of G1 and G3.
   - **G1 and G3 are in separate pathways**: The double mutant g1g3 has resistance (10%) worse than either single mutant, indicating their contributions are additive rather than redundant.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States G1 is the TF, which contradicts the data showing G2 is critical (0% resistance in g2). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: States G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. While G2 being the TF aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data, as g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.
- **Option C**: States G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is not evident in the data, and G1 being epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the g1g3 result (10% resistance, worse than either single mutant).
- **Option D**: States G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Gene redundancy is not supported, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data.

### Final Conclusion:
The data strongly support that G2 is the TF upstream of G1 and G3, which function in separate pathways contributing additively to resistance. However, none of the options perfectly align with this conclusion. Among the given options, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, even though the other claims are not fully supported.

ANSWER: C
