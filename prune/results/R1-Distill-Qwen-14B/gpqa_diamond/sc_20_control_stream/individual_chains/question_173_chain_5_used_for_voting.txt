Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Alright, the question is about the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron when we know the uncertainty in its position. Let me think about what I remember.

The problem states that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are all on the order of 1e-16 to 1e-18 J, so I think we'll be dealing with some very small numbers here.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes people just write it as ≈ ħ, depending on the context. I think in some derivations, they take the uncertainty as being about equal to ħ, so maybe the minimum uncertainty is when Δx * Δp = ħ/2. But for this problem, perhaps using the approximate equality is sufficient.

So, the electron's momentum p is related to its velocity and mass. The momentum p = m*v. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, Δp would be the uncertainty in momentum. So, Δp = m * Δv? Wait, no, because the velocity here is given as a specific value, v. So perhaps the uncertainty in momentum is m times the uncertainty in velocity, Δv. But wait, in the problem, the speed is given as v=2e8 m/s, but is the uncertainty in velocity given? No, it's not. Oh, but the question is about the uncertainty in energy. Hmm.

Wait a second, maybe I'm confusing this with the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh wait, no, because the question is about position and momentum leading to energy uncertainty. So perhaps I should think in terms of the momentum being uncertain, which in turn affects the kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), right? So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would come from the uncertainty in p. Let's see, using the uncertainty principle, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Then, the uncertainty in energy would be the uncertainty in p squared over 2m. So, I'll need to compute ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2 / (2m).

Let me jot down the variables I have:

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters = 1e-10 m.

v = 2e8 m/s. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need this value. Because the problem gives the speed, but I'm not certain if that's needed for calculating ΔE. Let me think again. The problem gives the speed, but I'm trying to find the minimum uncertainty in energy. So perhaps the kinetic energy is based on the momentum. But since the speed is given, I can compute the momentum. Hmm. Wait, but the momentum's uncertainty is Δp, not the actual p. So maybe the given speed isn't directly needed for the uncertainty calculation because the uncertainty is about the momentum, not the actual value. Hmm, but wait, maybe the speed is given to relate to the momentum. Or perhaps not, since the uncertainty in momentum is what matters here.

Wait, perhaps the speed is just extra information. Because the problem is about the uncertainty in position leading to uncertainty in momentum, which then affects the uncertainty in energy. So maybe the actual momentum value (from v) isn't needed, only the uncertainty. Let's clarify.

So, the process would be:

1. From Δx and the uncertainty principle, find Δp.

Δp ≈ ħ / (2 Δx). Well, sometimes it's written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum Δp would be when Δp = ħ/(2 Δx).

2. Then, the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE is approximated as (Δp)^2/(2m).

Wait, because the kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m) times the derivative or something? Hmm, maybe it's more accurate to use the formula for the uncertainty in E when p has an uncertainty Δp. So, E is a function of p, so the uncertainty in E would be approximately the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp.

So, dE/dp = p/m. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. Wait, but wait, since p is known, and Δp is the uncertainty, perhaps that's the approach. Alternatively, since E is a quadratic function of p, the uncertainty would be (Δp)^2 / (2m) times something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to treat E as E = p²/(2m), so the variance in E would be (Δp)^2 * (dE/dp)^2 / (something). But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to use the approximation ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), considering that E is proportional to p squared.

Wait, let's think again. If E = p^2/(2m), then the relative uncertainty in E can be found by taking the derivative. Alternatively, for small uncertainties, the change in E would be dE = (dE/dp) dp = (p/m) dp. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp.

But wait, in this case, I don't know the value of p, but I have the value of v. Since p = m v, and v is given as 2e8 m/s, but wait, no, because that's the actual speed, not the uncertainty. Hmm. Because the problem is about the uncertainty, maybe the actual p isn't needed, and the ΔE is based solely on Δp. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the given velocity to find the momentum's uncertainty. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to proceed step by step.

First, compute Δp using the uncertainty principle.

Δp ≈ ħ / (2 Δx). Wait, the reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, plugging in Δx = 1e-10 m:

Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) ) = approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but sometimes people just take Δp ≈ ħ / Δx, without the 1/2 factor, so perhaps it's better to calculate both possibilities, but I think the 1/2 is correct.

So, Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the energy uncertainty ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. The mass of an electron is approximately 9.1093837e-31 kg.

So, ΔE ≈ (5.27e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.1093837e-31 )

Calculating numerator: (5.27e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 * 1e-50 = approx 27.77 * 1e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.1093837e-31 ≈ 1.8218767e-30.

So, ΔE ≈ 2.777e-49 / 1.8218767e-30 = let's compute that.

Divide 2.777 by 1.8218767: approximately 1.524.

Then, exponents: 1e-49 / 1e-30 = 1e-19.

So, 1.524e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J.

Hmm, that matches. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

Compute (5.27e-25)^2: 5.27 squared is about 27.77, yes. So 27.77e-50 → 2.777e-49.

Divide by (2 * 9.109e-31) → 18.218e-31 → 1.8218e-30.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = (2.777 / 1.8218) )e-19.

2.777 / 1.8218 ≈ 1.525.

So, ΔE ≈ 1.525e-19 J, which is about 1.5e-19 J. So the closest option is C, ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but let me think again—could I have missed a factor somewhere? For example, in the uncertainty principle, sometimes the formula is written without the 1/2 factor. So, if I had used Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), then Δp would be about 1.05e-34 / 1e-10 = 1.05e-24 kg m/s.

Then, (1.05e-24)^2 = 1.1025e-48.

Divided by 2 * 9.1e-31 → 1.82e-30.

So, 1.1025e-48 / 1.82e-30 ≈ (1.1025 / 1.82) )e-18 → approx 0.605e-18 → 6.05e-19 J. So that's about 6e-19 J, which is still on the order of 1e-19, which is option C.

Alternatively, what if the problem uses the energy-time uncertainty principle? No, because here it's about position and momentum. The energy here would be kinetic energy, which depends on momentum.

Wait another point: the problem states that the electron is moving at speed v = 2e8 m/s. Is that information needed for this calculation? Because in the calculation I did, I didn't use v. So why is it given? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering it.

Wait, so maybe the uncertainty in energy isn't just from the uncertainty in momentum, but perhaps the speed is used to find the kinetic energy, and then the uncertainty in energy is a fraction of that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for energy, but since 2e8 m/s is less than the speed of light (which is ~3e8 m/s), maybe relativistic effects are small, but not entirely negligible. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. The non-relativistic kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So, if the speed is given, but the uncertainty is about position, maybe I should compute the momentum from v and then find the fractional uncertainty in momentum, which would affect the energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of Δp to p, which would then affect the energy uncertainty.

So, let's recast this approach:

p = m*v. So, p = 9.109e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.8218e-22 kg m/s.

Then, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.05457e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) = approx 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So, the fractional uncertainty in p is Δp/p = (5.27e-25)/(1.8218e-22) ≈ 0.0029, or about 0.29%.

Now, the fractional uncertainty in E would be approximately the same as the fractional uncertainty in p, because E = p²/(2m), so dE/E is approximately 2*(dp/p). Because E is proportional to p², so the relative uncertainty in E is about twice the relative uncertainty in p.

So, dE/E ≈ 2 * (0.29%) = 0.58%.

Then, the absolute uncertainty in E would be ΔE = E * (dE/E) = E * 0.0058.

Wait, but what's E? The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

E = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 kg * (2e8 m/s)^2.

Compute v squared: (2e8)^2 = 4e16 m²/s².

So E = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 * 4e16 = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 *4e16 = 0.5 * 3.6436e-14 = 1.8218e-14 J.

So E is approximately 1.82e-14 J.

Then, ΔE = E * 0.0058 = 1.82e-14 * 0.0058 ≈ 1.0556e-16 J.

Wait, that's about 1.06e-16 J, which would correspond to option D: ~1e-16 J.

Hmm, this is conflicting with the earlier result. So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the first approach didn't consider the actual momentum, and the second approach does. So which is the right way to calculate the uncertainty?

Let me think again. The first approach used ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), which is based on the kinetic energy formula. The second approach took the fractional uncertainty in p and applied it to E.

Wait, but both methods are trying to approximate the uncertainty in E due to the uncertainty in p. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is correct when Δp is the absolute uncertainty, and the second approach is using relative uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the first approach is more accurate. Because if you have Δp, the absolute uncertainty, then the corresponding ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m), regardless of the actual p.

Wait, but in the second approach, I found a much larger ΔE, which is 1e-16, option D. But in the first approach, it was ~1.5e-19 J, option C.

So which one is right?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me re-examine that.

In the second approach, I calculated E, then found the fractional uncertainty in E based on the fractional uncertainty in p. But wait, if E = p²/(2m), then the relative uncertainty in E is (2 Δp/p). So, for small fractional uncertainties, the absolute uncertainty in E is 2 E (Δp/p).

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, using error propagation. For a function E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately (dE) = (d(p²))/(2m) ) = (2p dp)/(2m) ) = (p dp)/(m). So, dE = (p/m) dp. Which is the same as ΔE = (p/m) Δp.

So, in that case, ΔE = (p/m) Δp.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me compute that.

We have p = m v. So, substituting into ΔE = (p/m) Δp, that becomes (m v / m) Δp = v Δp.

Wait, so ΔE = v * Δp.

Hmm, that's a simpler expression. Let me compute that.

From before, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

So, ΔE = 2e8 m/s * 5.27e-25 kg m/s = 2e8 *5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J.

Ah, that's the same result as the second approach. So about 1.05e-16 J, which is ~1e-16 J, option D.

Wait, but that contradicts the first approach. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to figure out which approach is the correct way to compute the uncertainty in energy.

The first approach used ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), treating E as a function of p and using a linear approximation of the square function. The second approach uses ΔE = (p/m) Δp, which comes from the same idea but perhaps a different way of error propagation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the error propagation. For E = p²/(2m), the differential is dE = (p/(m)) dp. So the absolute uncertainty in E is (p/(m)) * Δp.

But since p = m v, p/m = v. So, ΔE = v * Δp.

Wait, that's correct. So, substituting the numbers, as done above, gives ΔE ≈ 2e8 m/s * 5.27e-25 kg m/s = 1.054e-16 J.

So that's 1.05e-16 J, which is option D.

But why did the first approach give a different result?

In the first approach, I used ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Let me compute that again.

Using Δp = 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

(5.27e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 = 27.77 → 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Divide by 2m, which is 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = approximately 1.524e-19 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

So which approach is correct?

Ah, perhaps the first approach is incorrect. Because when you have E = p²/(2m), the absolute uncertainty in E is given by the derivative approach, which is dE = (p/m) dp. So that would mean ΔE = (p/m) Δp. Which gives the 1e-16 J.

But wait, why did the first approach give a different answer? Because the first approach is treating E as a function and taking the square of Δp, but perhaps that's not the correct way to compute the uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is correct when the uncertainty in p is small compared to p itself. Let's see.

In the first approach, E uncertainty is (Δp)^2/(2m) ≈ (5.27e-25)^2/(2*9.1e-31) ) ≈ 1.5e-19 J.

In the second approach, using ΔE = (p/m) Δp = v Δp = 2e8 *5.27e-25 ≈ 1.05e-16 J.

These are two different results, so I must determine which formula is the correct way to compute the uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the uncertainty in E is the one derived from error propagation for E = p²/(2m), which is ΔE = (p/m) Δp. Because E is a function of p, and the uncertainty in E depends on how p's uncertainty affects E.

So, using ΔE = (p/m) Δp, which gives 1e-16 J.

But why is the first approach giving a different result? Because the first approach is using the formula for the standard deviation of a function, perhaps for a quadratic function, which would suggest that the variance is (Δp)^2 * (dE/dp)^2.

Wait, because E is p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m.

So, the variance in E, σ_E² = (dE/dp)^2 * σ_p² = (p²/m²) * (σ_p²).

Then, σ_E = (p/m) * σ_p. Which is the same as ΔE = (p/m) Δp.

So, the correct approach is the second one, leading to ΔE ≈ 1e-16 J.

But wait, this contradicts the first approach, which used (Δp)^2/(2m).

Hmm, perhaps the first approach is wrong because it's treating the energy as (p^2)/(2m), and considering the absolute uncertainty without considering the actual value of p. So, perhaps the correct way is to use the derivative approach, leading to ΔE = (p/m) Δp.

So, in that case, the correct answer is D, ~1e-16 J.

But then why does the first approach give a different result? Because in the first approach, the calculation doesn't consider how E scales with p. So perhaps I was mistaken in the first approach, and the correct way is to apply the derivative.

But wait, I think I need to reconcile this. Let me think about the two approaches:

Approach 1: ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m) → ~1.5e-19 J.

Approach 2: ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp → ~1.05e-16 J.

Which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the assumption about the relation between Δp and Δx.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2.

So, the minimal uncertainty would be when Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

So, Δp = ħ/(2 Δx).

So, the minimal uncertainty in p is ħ/(2 Δx).

But when calculating the uncertainty in E, it's dependent on the actual p and the uncertainty in p.

So, in the problem, the electron has a certain momentum p = m v, but the uncertainty in p is Δp = ħ/(2 Δx).

So, the uncertainty in E is given by the derivative approach: ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp = (p/m) * Δp.

Since p = m v, this becomes v * Δp.

So, using Δp = ħ/(2 Δx), we have:

ΔE = v * ħ/(2 Δx).

Let me compute this using the given values.

v = 2e8 m/s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So, ΔE = (2e8) * (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10).

Compute the denominator first: 2 * 1e-10 = 2e-10.

So, 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10 = 5.272859e-25.

Multiply by 2e8: 2e8 *5.272859e-25 = (2 *5.272859) * 1e-17 = 10.545718e-17 → 1.0545718e-16 J.

So, ΔE ≈ 1.05e-16 J.

That's option D.

But wait, why did the first approach give a different answer? Because in the first approach, I treated ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m), which would be correct only if the uncertainty in p is a small fraction of p. But in reality, the uncertainty is about (Δp ≈ 5.27e-25, p ≈ 1.82e-22) → Δp/p ≈ 2.9e-3, which is about 0.29% of p. So, the uncertainty is small, but perhaps not negligible.

Wait, but the approach using the derivative gives a much higher ΔE than the first approach. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah! I think I see the confusion now. The first approach is using the formula for the standard deviation of a function when the function is quadratic, but perhaps that's not the correct way to compute the uncertainty when the function is E = p²/(2m). The correct way is to compute the uncertainty using the derivative, which gives ΔE = (p/m) Δp, as done in approach 2.

So, the correct answer should be option D, approximately 1e-16 J.

But earlier calculation using approach 1 gave 1.5e-19 J, which is option C. So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps approach 1 is incorrect because it's using the formula for the variance, which doesn't account for the actual value of p. Let me re-examine approach 1.

Approach 1: ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m).

But E = p²/(2m), so when p varies by Δp, the change in E is (p + Δp)^2/(2m) - p^2/(2m) = [2p Δp + (Δp)^2 ]/(2m).

So, the change in E is approximately (2 p Δp)/(2m) )= (p Δp)/m → ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp.

Which is exactly the same as approach 2. So, approach 1 is incorrect because it ignored the first term and only took the (Δp)^2 part, which is much smaller than the other term.

Ah, so approach 1 was wrong. The correct approach is approach 2, which uses the linear term, giving ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp, which is 1e-16 J.

So the correct answer is option D.

But wait, wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in the first approach. I used the formula for the uncertainty in E as (Δp)^2/(2m), which is incorrect. The correct way is to calculate ΔE using the derivative, which gives (p/m) Δp. So, the first approach was wrong, and the second approach is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, ~1e-16 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron moving with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and position uncertainty \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy.

### Key Steps:
1. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:  
   The uncertainty in momentum is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
   \]  
   where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta p \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]

2. **Uncertainty in Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy of the electron is \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( m = 9.1093837 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)).  
   The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) by:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{p}{m} \Delta p.
   \]  
   Since \( p = m v \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx v \Delta p.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx (2 \times 10^8) \times (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Critical Analysis of Approaches**:  
   - The first approach, which used \( \Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m} \), is incorrect because it ignores the linear term in the energy uncertainty formula.  
   - The correct approach uses the derivative of the energy with respect to momentum, leading to \( \Delta E \approx v \Delta p \), which gives \( \Delta E \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \).

### Conclusion:
The minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately \( 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
