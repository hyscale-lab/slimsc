Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. Then, I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms product 4 has. The options are from A to D, with numbers 6, 8, 10, or 7.

Alright, let's break down each reaction.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a dibromination. Wait, no, cyclohexanone has an alpha position. Oh, right! The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So, when you add Br2 to a ketone like cyclohexanone, it's an addition reaction. It probably adds across the carbonyl group, but wait, no, more likely it's an enolate formation. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think when ketones react with bromine, it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which brominates the alpha carbons. So, that would add Br atoms to the alpha positions.

Wait, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons: each of the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. So adding Br to those positions. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromo-cyclohexanone? Or maybe 1,1-dibromo? Wait, no, the alpha carbons are each CH2, so adding Br to each, so perhaps 1,2-dibromo cyclohexanone. But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a carbonyl. The alpha carbons are each CH2, so adding Br to each of these.

Wait, but adding Br2 to a ketone... Another thought: maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position, but since there are two equivalent alpha positions (they're both CH2 groups), adding Br to each. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the numbering. Let me imagine cyclohexanone: the carbonyl is at position 1. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, but since the ring is symmetric, those two are equivalent. So adding Br to both would give 1,2-dibromo or perhaps 1,6-dibromo. But either way, the molecule has two Br atoms at the alpha positions.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe it's a diaddition across the carbonyl? Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone? No, wait, bromine (Br2) is added via a conjugate addition? Hmm. No, I think in this case, the reaction is more likely an enolate formation leading to dibromination. So product 1 would have two Br atoms on the alpha carbons.

But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition of Br to the carbonyl. But cyclohexanone is a ketone, so adding Br2 would not directly add to the carbonyl because that would require a more reactive group. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via a different mechanism. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening? No, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so adding Br2 might not do that. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxidation? No, that's with peracids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. I think in such cases, it's an example of the addition of bromine to a carbonyl group. But wait, ketones don't usually add bromine easily. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha bromination. So, the mechanism would be abstraction of an alpha proton by Br, forming an enolate, which then adds another Br. So product 1 would have two Br atoms at the alpha positions.

So after step 1, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Wait, but cyclohexanone is (CH2)5CH-C=O, right? So the two adjacent CH2 groups are positions 2 and 6. So adding Br to each would result in a diegeminal dibromide, but wait, alpha positions are on adjacent carbons. So in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so C2 and C6 are the alpha positions. So adding Br to C2 and C3? No, wait, maybe it's adding Br to C2 and C2 again, making a geminal dibromide. Oh, wait no, the alpha carbons are each CH2 groups, so each has two Hs.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction again. When ketones react with bromine in a solution, it's a bromination at the alpha positions. Since cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions (both CH2 groups), adding Br to each would give a 1,2-dibromo-cyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone? Or perhaps 1,2-dibromo? Wait, numbering in a ring can be tricky. Let me think: cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The carbonyl is at position 1. So the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. So adding Br to both 2 and 6 positions would give 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. Or perhaps each of those positions gets a Br, but are they both substituted?

Alternatively, perhaps each alpha position has a Br, but only one Br per alpha carbon. So each of the two alpha positions (2 and 6) would have a Br, so it's 2-bromo and 6-bromo. But wait, in cyclohexanone, the two alpha positions are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So when you add Br, you'd have two Br atoms, each on a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

So product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone, right? So moving on to the next step.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. So that's probably an elimination reaction. If product 1 has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, then heating with NaOH would likely lead to an elimination, forming a double bond. So, with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, the base (OH-) would abstract a beta proton, leading to the formation of a double bond and the loss of HBr.

Wait, but wait: product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. So positions 2 and 6 each have a Br. When heated with NaOH, which is a strong base, it would likely cause an elimination, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, perhaps? Wait, but C1 is the carbonyl. So maybe elimination between C2 and C3? Or between C1 and C2?

Wait, no, the carbonyl is at C1. So elimination would occur between C2 and C3, but wait, product 1 has Br on C2 and C6. Hmm, maybe the base will abstract a proton from C3, leading to elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, if the Br is on C6, then elimination could happen between C6 and C5? Hmm, but the ring structure complicates this.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Let's imagine cyclohexanone with the ketone at C1. Then, Br is on C2 and C6. Now, when NaOH is added, the base may deprotonate C3 (adjacent to C2), leading to elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, on the other side, the Br on C6 could lead to elimination, forming a double bond between C6 and C5.

But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring. If Br is on C2 and C6, elimination would form two double bonds? Or perhaps form a conjugated diene? Hmm, but that would require elimination in two places. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a diene, so maybe it just forms a single double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the base will abstract a proton from C3, leading to the departure of Br from C2, forming an alkene between C2 and C3. Similarly, the same thing would happen on the other side, but that would lead to a ring with two double bonds, which might not be possible. So perhaps it's more likely that one double bond forms, but that doesn't make sense because both Br atoms are present.

Wait, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, which would allow a conjugated diene after elimination. Wait, but if the two Brs are on C2 and C3, then elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, the starting material after the first reaction would have Br on adjacent carbons. Wait wait, maybe I got the first step wrong. Let me re-express cyclohexanone.

Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. The carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) are each CH2 groups. So when product 1 is formed, each of these (C2 and C6) have a Br. So the structure would be (Br)CH2-C(=O)-CH2-Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Cyclohexanone: six-membered ring, with one carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1. The two adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) are each CH2. When Br2 adds to the alpha positions, each of these CH2 groups becomes CHBr. So product 1 would have Br on C2 and C6. So structure is (Br)CH2-C(=O)-CH2-Br in the ring? No, wait, the ring is cyclohexane, so it's a six-membered ring. So in the ring, positions 2 and 6 each have a Br.

So when we heat it with NaOH, the base will abstract a proton from a carbon adjacent to a Br. Let's say the base abstracts a proton from C3 (adjacent to C2). Then, the Br on C2 leaves, and a double bond forms between C2 and C3. Similarly, the Br on C6 would cause elimination of a proton from C5, forming a double bond between C5 and C6. But wait, that would give a conjugated diene in the ring, which is a possibility.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If two Br atoms are on C2 and C6, then elimination would form double bonds between C2-C3 and C6-C5. But that would create two double bonds in the ring, which might not be possible in a six-membered ring without being conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to a double bond between C2 and C3, and the Br on C6 would eliminate as well, leading to another double bond.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, can you have two double bonds without being conjugated? Like 1,3-diene? Hmm, but that would require the ring to be non-planar, which is possible. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes a conjugated diene. Wait, but 1,3-diene in a six-membered ring would be a conjugated system. Let me think: cyclohexadiene.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a cyclohexene ring with a double bond. But if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond between them, making a cyclohexene ring with one double bond. Wait, but product 1 has Br on C2 and C6, which are across the ring from each other, not adjacent. Oh wait, in a six-membered ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the carbonyl, but they are opposite each other (para positions). So perhaps when the NaOH is added, the two Brs are on opposite sides, and elimination occurs from each, forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think about the product after elimination. If product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone, and upon heating with NaOH, each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So when the Br leaves, each elimination would form a double bond between C2-C3 and C6-C5, leading to a 1,3-diene in the ring. Wait, because the ring is six-membered, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other. So eliminating from C2 and C6 would form double bonds at C2-C3 and C6-C5, creating a conjugated diene in the ring.

Wait, but that would make a conjugated diene, which would be 1,3-cyclohexadienone? No, the carbonyl is at C1. So the ring would have a ketone at C1 and double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. That would form a conjugated diene system, but perhaps that's not possible because the ring would become too strained.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to the elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, the same process occurs on the other side, leading to a double bond between C6 and C5. So the ring would have two double bonds: C2-C3 and C5-C6. That would make a conjugated diene, but in a six-membered ring, that's possible as it's a conjugated system.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility: maybe the elimination doesn't happen on both Br atoms, only one. But why would that be the case? Because both Brs are present, and the conditions are such that elimination would occur. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can't support two double bonds, so the molecule might form a single double bond, but which one? Maybe the more substituted one.

Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the product as cyclohexanone with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, but after elimination, perhaps a single double bond forms. Then product 2 would be a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a different approach. Maybe the first reaction is bromination at the alpha position, leading to a single Br on each of the two alpha carbons. But then, when heated with NaOH, each Br undergoes elimination. So perhaps each Br is eliminated, forming two double bonds, but that doesn't seem feasible in a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps only one elimination occurs, forming a single double bond.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Another possibility is that the first reaction adds Br across the carbonyl group. So cyclohexanone (C=O) reacts with Br2 to form a dibromide. But I think that's more of an addition reaction, like in the case of alkenes. But ketones don't typically add Br2 directly. Hmm.

Wait a second, maybe the first reaction is an example of benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Michael addition? No, that's for enones.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a bromonium ion formation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe I should look up what happens when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. Oh wait, in the presence of a base, bromine can add to the alpha position. I think that's the case here. So product 1 is 2-bromo-cyclohexanone. Wait, but why only one Br? Because cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions, perhaps only one is brominated? But the reaction is with Br2, so maybe both are brominated.

So product 1 would be 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone.

Then, step 2: heating with NaOH (a base) would lead to elimination. The base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since we have Br on C2 and C6, elimination could occur from either side.

Wait, perhaps the NaOH induces an E2 elimination. So each Br leaves, with the base abstracting a proton from the adjacent carbon. So for the Br on C2, the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to double bond between C2-C3. Similarly, the Br on C6 would lead to a double bond between C6-C5.

So product 2 would have double bonds at C2-C3 and C5-C6. So that would form a conjugated diene. But wait, in a six-membered ring, that would mean the ring has two double bonds, making it a conjugated cyclohexadiene with a ketone group.

Wait, but that would make a cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one. Which is a conjugated dienone. That structure is possible. So product 2 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienone.

Moving on to step 3: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3. Thionyl chloride is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but wait, product 2 is a ketone, so perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, but product 2 is a cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, which is a ketone. So treating a ketone with SOCl2 would form an acyl chloride. So cyclohexa-2,5-dienone would react with SOCl2 to form cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride.

Wait, but wait, the double bonds are present. So the structure would be O=C-(CH2CH2) with double bonds? No, wait, it's a conjugated dienone. So, after treatment with SOCl2, the ketone (O) is replaced with Cl. So product 3 would be 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride.

Step 4: product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(LiAlH3)) to form product 4. Wait, but wait, no. LiAlH3 is typically a strong reducing agent. Wait, but if product 3 is an acid chloride, then LiAlH would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol. Wait, but wait, let's think again. The reagent is LiAlH(LiAlH3?), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, the reagent is Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which is a bulky reducing agent. It's more selective; it typically reduces esters to alcohols without reducing other groups, but in the case of acid chlorides, perhaps it would reduce the carbonyl to a CH2 group.

Wait, no, LiAlH3 (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride would be reduced to cyclohexa-2,5-dienol. Wait, no, because the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Wait, no: the structure is O=C-R, so when reduced, becomes CH2-OH? No, wait, ketone (RCOR') reduces to RCH2OR' or RCH2CH2OH? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure of product 3 is (O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-), but that's not correct. Let me correct: product 2 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone at C1 and double bonds at C2-C3 and C5-C6. So when SOCl2 is added, the ketone becomes a Cl. So product 3 is 1-chloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene.

Wait, no, the product is actually a cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride, which is a cyclic structure. So when LiAlH is used, it would reduce the carbonyl chloride to a primary alcohol. But wait, the carbonyl is part of a conjugated diene. So the structure would be O=C-(CH2-CH2), but that's not right. Let me think again.

Product 3 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride, which is a cyclic structure with the Cl at position 1 (the former ketone). So when LiAlH is used, the carbonyl (Cl) would be reduced to an alcohol. So product 4 would be cyclohexa-2,5-dienol. Wait, but cyclohexa-2,5-dienol would have an OH group at position 1, and double bonds at 2-3 and 5-6.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure. The ring has a six-membered structure with OH at C1, and double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. So the ring would look like:

O
||
C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is double-bonded to C3, and C6 is double-bonded to C5. C3 is connected to C4, which is a single bond, and C4 connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6.

Wait, but that can't be right because in a six-membered ring, having two double bonds would require conjugation. So the structure would be cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol.

So product 4 is cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So I need to analyze the structure of cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol and count the distinct Hs.

Let me draw the structure:

Positions: 1 (OH), 2 (double bond to 3), 3 (double bond to 2), 4 (single), 5 (double bond to 6), 6 (double bond to 5).

Wait, no. Let me imagine the ring as follows. Positions 1 has the OH. Then, there's a double bond between 2 and 3, and another between 5 and 6. So the ring would have double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6.

So the structure is:

Positions 1: OH
Position 2: double bond to 3
Position 3: double bond to 2
Position 4: single bond to 5
Position 5: double bond to 6
Position 6: double bond to 5

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring as a conjugated diene. So in a six-membered ring, the double bonds are at C1-C2 and C4-C5, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,3-diene. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

- C1: OH
- C2 double bond C3
- C4 single bond C5 (but C5 double bond C6)

Wait, but that would make the ring have a double bond between 2-3 and another between 5-6, which are adjacent? Hmm, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, the ring has a conjugated diene across positions 2-3-4-5, but that would require four carbons, which isn't feasible in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps, and product 4 is something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenol with a single double bond. Let me try another approach. Let me recount the reactions.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone (product 1)
2. Product 1 + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene with a ketone? Or perhaps cyclohexenone with a double bond.

Wait, maybe during the second step, the NaOH leads to the formation of cyclohexenone. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone.

Wait, but how? Let me think again. Product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. When heated with NaOH, the base could abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. So for each Br on C2 and C6, elimination would form double bonds at C1-C2 and C1-C6? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, the Br on C6 would lead to elimination, forming a double bond between C6 and C5. So the ring would have two double bonds, making a conjugated diene. But that's a possibility.

If product 2 is 2,5-cyclohexadienone (conjugated dienone), then product 3 would be 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride. Then, product 4 would be 2,5-cyclohexadienol after reduction.

So now, product 4 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienol. Let's imagine its structure. The ring has a ketone at C1, which is reduced to an alcohol (OH at C1). There are double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. So the structure is a six-membered ring with OH at C1, double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6.

Now, to find the number of distinct H atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.

In product 4, the molecule is a six-membered ring with an OH group at C1, and two double bonds at C2-C3 and C5-C6. Let's number the positions:

1: OH
2: double bond to 3
3: double bond to 2
4: single bond to 5
5: double bond to 6
6: double bond to 5

But wait, that can't form a proper ring. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are between C1-C2 and C4-C5, making a conjugated diene from C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, but that would require four atoms, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C4-C5, making a conjugated diene in positions 2-3-4-5.

Wait, but that would make a four-membered conjugated system, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexene with the OH group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think of the molecule as a substituted cyclohexene. Let me try to think of the structure of product 4.

After the reduction, product 4 is an alcohol derived from the acid chloride. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group and two double bonds. Wait, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a cyclohexanol derivative with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexenol, with a double bond at position 2 and an OH at position 1. So the structure would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

In that case, the molecule would have the OH at position 1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and the rest single bonds.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C1-OH
|
C2 double bond C3
C3 connected to C4
C4 connected to C5
C5 connected to C6
C6 connected back to C1.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, a double bond between C2 and C3 would make the ring have a single double bond. So the molecule would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

Now, to count the distinct H atoms:

C1 has an OH group and is connected to C2 and C6. So the Hs on C1 (if any) would be determined by the structure. Wait, cyclohex-2-en-1-ol would have the structure:

HO-C1-C2=C3-C4-C5-C6-C1

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me structure it properly.

The ring would be:

- C1: OH attached, connected to C2 and C6.
- C2: double bond to C3.
- C3: double bond to C2, connected to C4.
- C4: connected to C5.
- C5: connected to C6.
- C6: connected to C1 and C5.

Wait, but that's a six-membered ring with C2-C3 as a double bond and OH at C1.

So, the structure is:

      O
      |
C1-OH connected to C2 and C6.

C2 is double bonded to C3.

C3 is connected to C4.

C4 is connected to C5.

C5 is connected to C6.

C6 is connected to C1 and C5.

So, the molecule is cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

Now, let's number the carbons and look for symmetry.

C1: has an OH group. The Hs on C1: in cyclohexanol, C1 is a CH2 group, but in this case, since it's cyclohexenol, perhaps C1 is a CHOH group. Wait, no, cyclohexenol would have the OH on C1, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but in cyclohexenol, C1 is CH2OH? No, perhaps not. Let me think again.

In cyclohex-2-en-1-ol, the structure is a six-membered ring where C1 is the one with the OH (so it's a secondary alcohol), and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the structure would have:

C1: -CH2-OH (if the ring is such that C1 is CH2). Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, all carbons are CH2 except possibly for substituents.

Wait, perhaps C1 is CH2OH, connected to C2 and C6.

C2 is double bonded to C3 (so C2 is CH).

C3 is double bonded to C2 (so CH as well), connected to C4.

C4 is CH2 connected to C5.

C5 is CH2 connected to C6.

C6 is CH2 connected back to C1.

Wait, but that's a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2-C3, and an OH on C1.

So, the structure would be:

Positions:

1: CH2OH

2: CH2 (but wait, double bond between 2-3, so C2 is CH-.

3: CH- (double bond to 2), connected to C4.

4: CH2 connected to C5.

5: CH2 connected to C6.

6: CH2 connected to C1.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps C2 is CH with a double bond to C3, which is also CH, connected to C4.

So the molecule would be:

C1: -CH2-OH

C2: CH2 connected to C1 and double bonded to C3.

Wait, no, C2 can't be CH2 if it's double bonded. So C2 would be CH, connected to C1 (CH2OH) and double bonded to C3 (CH).

C3: CH, connected to C2 and C4 (CH2).

C4: CH2 connected to C3 and C5 (CH2).

C5: CH2 connected to C4 and C6 (CH2).

C6: CH2 connected to C5 and C1 (CH2OH).

Wait, but in this case, C2 and C3 are each CH groups, and the rest are CH2.

So, the structure is a cyclohexene with the double bond between C2 and C3, and an OH group on C1.

Now, to determine the number of distinct H atoms.

Let's analyze each carbon:

C1: CH2OH. The two Hs on C1 are equivalent because the molecule is symmetrical around the plane passing through C1 and the double bond. So the two Hs on C1 are equivalent, but wait, with the double bond, maybe they're not. Wait, no, because the double bond is between C2 and C3, which are adjacent to C1. So the structure is such that C1 is attached to C2 (CH) and C6 (CH2).

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the molecule may have some symmetry. Let's imagine looking at C1, which is attached to C2 (double bond) and C6 (single bond). The molecule may not have a plane of symmetry, leading to all Hs being distinct.

But perhaps not. Let's think about each position's Hs.

C1: CH2OH. The two Hs are on the same carbon. Are they equivalent? Since the molecule is not symmetrical, these Hs might be equivalent because they're on the same carbon and the substituents are arranged symmetrically? Or perhaps not. Wait, since the molecule has a double bond, maybe the Hs on C1 are equivalent due to the plane of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the Hs on C1 are all equivalent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this by considering each H's environment.

1. C1: attached to OH and two CH2 groups (C2 and C6). So the Hs on C1 are in the same environment. So each H on C1 is the same. So one unique H.

2. C2: attached to C1 (CH2OH), double bonded to C3. So the Hs on C2, if any, would be on the same side of the double bond. Wait, but C2 is a CH group with a double bond, so it has no Hs attached. Because in a double bond, the carbons are each bonded to two other atoms (like in an alkene). So C2 has no Hs.

Wait, no: in an alkene, each C is bonded to two other Cs and two Hs (if it's a CH2 group). Wait, no, if it's a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond, then:

Wait, no, in the structure I described earlier, C2 is CH, with a single bond to C1 (CH2OH) and a double bond to C3 (CH). So C2 has one H attached. Similarly, C3 has one H attached.

So, C2 has one H, and C3 has one H.

Are these Hs equivalent? Since the molecule is cyclohexene with the double bond between C2 and C3, and an OH on C1, the Hs on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps leading them to be non-equivalent.

3. C4: connected to C3 (CH) and C5 (CH2). So C4 is a CH2 group. The two Hs on C4 would be equivalent if the ring is symmetrical.

But in this molecule, the ring isn't symmetrical because of the OH group on C1 and the double bond. So the Hs on C4 would be in a different environment than those on C5 or C6.

Wait, C4 is connected to C3 (CH) and C5 (CH2). So C4 is a CH2 group, but its position in the ring may make its Hs unique.

4. C5: connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). So C5 is a CH2 group. The Hs here may be unique as well.

5. C6: connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH2OH). So C6 is a CH2 group. The Hs here may be unique.

So, let's count:

- C1: 2 Hs (but are they equivalent? Since the molecule isn't symmetrical, the two Hs might be different. Or perhaps they are the same. If C1 is CH2OH, the two Hs are on the same carbon and possibly equivalent. So maybe one unique H here.

- C2: 1 H, unique.

- C3: 1 H, unique.

- C4: 2 Hs, but are they equivalent? If the ring is such that C4 is adjacent to the double bond, maybe the Hs are equivalent. Or perhaps not, due to the asymmetry caused by the OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Hs on C4 are in the same environment, making them equivalent. So one unique H for C4.

- C5: 2 Hs, perhaps equivalent, so one unique H.

- C6: 2 Hs, perhaps equivalent, so one unique H.

Wait, but let's think again about each position.

C1: CH2OH. The two Hs are on the same carbon. Are they equivalent? Since the substituents around the ring are not symmetrical, the Hs on C1 would be in different environments, but wait, looking from the C1, the two Hs are on the same carbon and attached to the same groups, so they are equivalent. So C1 contributes one unique H.

C2: CH group. One H, which is in a unique environment because it's attached to a double bond and adjacent to C1 (CH2OH). So this H is unique.

C3: CH group. One H, attached to a double bond and adjacent to C4 (CH2). Since the molecule isn't symmetrical, this H is unique.

C4: CH2 group. Are the two Hs on C4 equivalent? The groups around C4 are CH3 (no, C4 is connected to C3 and C5, which are CH and CH2, respectively). So the two Hs on C4 are in the same environment. So one unique H here.

C5: CH2 group. Connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). So the two Hs here are equivalent. One unique H.

C6: CH2 group. Connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH2OH). So the two Hs are in the same environment, making them equivalent. One unique H.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing some aspects. Let me count this again.

C1: 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: 1 H → unique.

C3: 1 H → unique.

C4: 2 Hs → unique.

C5: 2 Hs → unique.

C6: 2 Hs → unique.

Adding them up: 1 + 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 6 unique Hs. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't include 6 as the correct answer for this problem. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: perhaps product 4 is not a cyclohexene but a different structure.

Wait, maybe during the reduction step (step 4), the acid chloride is reduced to a primary alcohol, but the double bonds are lost. No, because the acid chloride is part of a conjugated system, and the reducing conditions might not affect the double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't affect the double bonds, so they remain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of product 4 is different. Let me think again.

Wait, let's retrace the steps.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone.

2. 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone + NaOH → elimination to form 2,5-cyclohexadienone.

3. 2,5-cyclohexadienone + SOCl2 → 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride.

4. 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride + LiAlH → reduction to 2,5-cyclohexadienol.

So the structure is cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol.

In this structure, the ring has double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6, and an OH group at C1.

Now, let's count the distinct Hs:

C1: OH attached. So C1 is CH2OH.

Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So C1 is attached to C2 and C6, and has the OH.

So, C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs, which are equivalent.

C2: double bond to C3, so C2 is CH. So it has one H attached.

C3: double bond to C2 → CH. One H attached.

C4: single bonds to C3 and C5 → CH2. Two Hs.

C5: double bond to C6 → CH. One H.

C6: double bond to C5 → CH. One H.

So, the Hs are:

C1: 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: 1 H → unique.

C3: 1 H → unique.

C4: 2 Hs → 1 unique (since both are in the same environment).

C5: 1 H → unique.

C6: 1 H → unique.

Total: 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) +1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 6 unique Hs.

But this would give 6, which is option A. But earlier, I thought the correct answer is 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed some Hs. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on C4 are not equivalent. Because C4 is between two CH groups (C3 and C5), but C3 is part of a double bond, and C5 is part of a double bond. So the Hs on C4 might be in a unique environment.

Wait, but in a cyclohexadiene ring, the double bonds are conjugated. So the ring is flat, and the molecule is planar. So for C4, which is between two CH groups, perhaps the two Hs are equivalent.

So, that would give 1 (C1) +1 (C2) +1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 6.

But the options have 6 as option A, which would be the answer, but earlier I thought the answer was 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternative possibility: perhaps during the elimination step (step 2), only one Br is eliminated, forming a single double bond. Let me reevaluate.

If product 1 is 2-bromo-cyclohexanone, then step 2 would eliminate to form cyclohexenone. So product 2 is cyclohexenone.

Then, step 3: cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Step 4: cyclohexenoyl chloride + LiAlH → cyclohexenol.

In this case, product 4 would be cyclohexenol, with an OH group and a single double bond.

So the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol or cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

Let me consider cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

So, the structure is:

C1: OH attached, connected to C2 and C6.

C2: double bond to C3 → CH.

C3: double bond to C2 → CH, connected to C4.

C4: connected to C3 and C5 → CH2.

C5: connected to C4 and C6 → CH2.

C6: connected to C5 and C1 → CH2.

So, Hs:

C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: CH → 1 H.

C3: CH → 1 H.

C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

So, 1 (C1) +1 (C2) +1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 6 unique Hs.

But that again leads to 6, which is option A.

But I'm supposed to pick the correct answer, which I think is 8, but perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination leads to a geminal dibromide. Let me think: when Br2 is added to the alpha position, perhaps it adds to the same carbon, leading to 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

If that's the case, then product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Then, step 2: heating with NaOH would cause elimination, leading to the loss of two Br atoms and the formation of a double bond.

So, product 2 would be cyclohexenone, with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Then, step 3: cyclohexenone → cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Step 4: reduction to cyclohexenol.

In this case, product 4 is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

In this structure, the Hs would be:

C1: CH2 connected to C2 (CH) and C6 (CH2).

C2: CH2OH (if C2 is the OH group), but no, in this case, OH is at C2.

Wait, let's structure it correctly. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and OH is at C1, then product 4 would be cyclohex-1-en-1-ol, which isn't possible because that would imply adjacent OH and double bond, which isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is at C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So, the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

In this case, C2 has the OH group and is connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

So, the structure would be:

C1: double bond to C2, connected to C6.

C2: OH attached, connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

C3: connected to C2 and C4 → CH2.

C4: connected to C3 and C5 → CH2.

C5: connected to C4 and C6 → CH2.

C6: connected to C5 and C1 → CH2.

Now, the Hs:

C1: CH (double bond to C2 and connected to C6). So C1 has no Hs attached.

C2: CH(OH) → one H attached.

C3: CH2 → two Hs.

C4: CH2 → two Hs.

C5: CH2 → two Hs.

C6: CH2 → two Hs.

So, counting:

C1: 0 Hs.

C2: 1 H → unique.

C3: 2 Hs → are they equivalent? Since C3 is connected to C2 (OH) and C4 (CH2), perhaps the two Hs are equivalent. So 1 unique.

C4: 2 Hs → connected to C3 (CH2) and C5 (CH2). Are these Hs equivalent? If the ring is symmetrical around C4, then yes. So 1 unique.

C5: 2 Hs → connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). So 1 unique.

C6: 2 Hs → connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH). Are these Hs equivalent? Since C1 has no Hs, and C6 is connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH), perhaps the two Hs are equivalent. So 1 unique.

Adding up: 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 5 unique Hs. But that doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some Hs. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has more symmetry, leading to fewer unique Hs.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the final product is 1,2-cyclohexanediol or something similar. No, that doesn't fit the reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial bromination adds Br across the carbonyl, making a dibromide. Then, elimination forms a conjugated diene.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think of the possible answer options.

The options are 6, 8, 10, 7.

If product 4 is a benzene ring, the number of Hs would be different, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps product 4 has a tricyclic structure, but no, the starting material is cyclohexanone.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction steps, the ring opens, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps during the reduction, the double bonds are hydrogenated, so product 4 is a cyclohexanol derivative without double bonds.

But no, the reducing agent (LiAlH) typically doesn't hydrogenate double bonds unless it's a very strong condition. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds remain.

Wait, LiAlH is a hydride source and is used for reductions. Acid chlorides are reduced to alcohols. It's possible that the double bonds are not affected under these conditions.

So, perhaps product 4 is a cyclohexene with an OH group.

Assuming that, the number of distinct Hs would be 6, but the options include 6 as A.

But the options given are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try an alternative approach.

Alternative approach after step 3:

Product 3 is an acid chloride, which upon reduction would form an alcohol. But if the acid chloride is part of a conjugated system, perhaps the reduction adds Hs in a way that produces more Hs.

Wait, but regardless, the main point is to count the Hs in product 4.

Another thought: perhaps product 4 is a diol, but that would require a dihydroxylation, which isn't part of the steps given.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step forms a single double bond, leading to a less substituted structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial elimination forms a cyclohexenone, which upon treatment with SOCl2 forms a chloroketone, and then upon reduction, becomes a cyclohexenol.

In that case, the structure would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

In this structure, the Hs would be:

C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: CH → 1 H.

C3: CH → 1 H.

C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

Total: 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 unique Hs.

But the options have 6 as A. So why would the correct answer be 8?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some Hs. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. If the elimination step forms a diene, then the number of Hs might increase due to the more complex structure.

If product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadienone, then product 4 would be 1,3-cyclohexadienol.

In that case, the structure would have double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4.

But then, the counting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 4 has more substituents leading to more distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the final structure as a bicyclic compound, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial bromination leads to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the elimination, product 2 is a cyclohexene, and then product 3 is a cyclohexenoyl chloride, and product 4 is cyclohexenol.

In that case, the structure would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

In this structure, the Hs are as follows:

- C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C2: CH → 1 H.

- C3: CH → 1 H.

- C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

Total: 6 unique Hs.

But the options don't have 6 as the correct answer for this problem, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination is different. Maybe instead of adding Br to the alpha positions, it's adding across the carbonyl group, forming a bromohydrin.

Wait, when ketones react with bromine in a specific condition, they can form a bromohydrin via the hydrobromic acid addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a dihydroxylation, but that's more typical with other reagents.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is 8, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has more substituents leading to more distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 has a geminal diol, but that would require oxidation, which isn't part of these steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial bromination adds Br across the carbonyl, leading to a diepoxide, but no, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, which isn't reactive enough for SN2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the final structure as a bicyclic compound with more substituents, but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)7.

Wait, perhaps in the structure, there are seven distinct Hs.

How?

If product 4 is a cyclohexene with an OH group, perhaps the structure leads to seven distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some Hs.

Let me try to count again with this structure:

Cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

- C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C2: CH → 1 H.

- C3: CH → 1 H.

- C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

Total: 6 unique Hs. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6, which is option A.

But earlier I thought the answer was 8, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure after the elimination is different. If product 2 is a different dienone, leading to a more complex structure in product 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination adds Br to the same carbon, leading to a geminal dibromide, which upon elimination forms a more substituted double bond.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, I think the final product has 6 distinct Hs. So the answer is A)6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending with product 4, and the goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha positions (C2 and C6), forming 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. Each alpha carbon (C2 and C6) gains a bromine atom.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH → Product 2**  
   Heating 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone with NaOH induces an elimination reaction. The base abstracts a proton from a beta carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. The elimination occurs at both C2 and C6, forming a conjugated diene in the ring. The resulting product is cyclohexa-2,5-dienone.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   The ketone group in cyclohexa-2,5-dienone reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form the corresponding acid chloride, cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride.

4. **Reaction 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (a strong reducing agent) reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The resulting product is cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol, which has an OH group at C1, double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6, and single bonds elsewhere.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - **C1**: The OH group is attached to C1, which is a CH₂ group. The two hydrogens on C1 are equivalent, contributing 1 unique hydrogen.  
   - **C2**: C2 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  
   - **C3**: C3 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  
   - **C4**: C4 is a CH₂ group with two hydrogens. These hydrogens are equivalent, contributing 1 unique hydrogen.  
   - **C5**: C5 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  
   - **C6**: C6 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  

   Adding these contributions:  
   1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 1 (C6) = **6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **6**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. Then, I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms product 4 has. The options are from A to D, with numbers 6, 8, 10, or 7.

Alright, let's break down each reaction.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a dibromination. Wait, no, cyclohexanone has an alpha position. Oh, right! The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So, when you add Br2 to a ketone like cyclohexanone, it's an addition reaction. It probably adds across the carbonyl group, but wait, no, more likely it's an enolate formation. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think when ketones react with bromine, it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which brominates the alpha carbons. So, that would add Br atoms to the alpha positions.

Wait, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons: each of the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. So adding Br to those positions. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromo-cyclohexanone? Or maybe 1,1-dibromo? Wait, no, the alpha carbons are each CH2, so adding Br to each, so perhaps 1,2-dibromo cyclohexanone. But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a carbonyl. The alpha carbons are each CH2, so adding Br to each of these.

Wait, but adding Br2 to a ketone... Another thought: maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position, but since there are two equivalent alpha positions (they're both CH2 groups), adding Br to each. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the numbering. Let me imagine cyclohexanone: the carbonyl is at position 1. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, but since the ring is symmetric, those two are equivalent. So adding Br to both would give 1,2-dibromo or perhaps 1,6-dibromo. But either way, the molecule has two Br atoms at the alpha positions.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe it's a diaddition across the carbonyl? Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone? No, wait, bromine (Br2) is added via a conjugate addition? Hmm. No, I think in this case, the reaction is more likely an enolate formation leading to dibromination. So product 1 would have two Br atoms on the alpha carbons.

But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition of Br to the carbonyl. But cyclohexanone is a ketone, so adding Br2 would not directly add to the carbonyl because that would require a more reactive group. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via a different mechanism. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening? No, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so adding Br2 might not do that. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxidation? No, that's with peracids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. I think in such cases, it's an example of the addition of bromine to a carbonyl group. But wait, ketones don't usually add bromine easily. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha bromination. So, the mechanism would be abstraction of an alpha proton by Br, forming an enolate, which then adds another Br. So product 1 would have two Br atoms at the alpha positions.

So after step 1, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Wait, but cyclohexanone is (CH2)5CH-C=O, right? So the two adjacent CH2 groups are positions 2 and 6. So adding Br to each would result in a diegeminal dibromide, but wait, alpha positions are on adjacent carbons. So in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so C2 and C6 are the alpha positions. So adding Br to C2 and C3? No, wait, maybe it's adding Br to C2 and C2 again, making a geminal dibromide. Oh, wait no, the alpha carbons are each CH2 groups, so each has two Hs.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction again. When ketones react with bromine in a solution, it's a bromination at the alpha positions. Since cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions (both CH2 groups), adding Br to each would give a 1,2-dibromo-cyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone? Or perhaps 1,2-dibromo? Wait, numbering in a ring can be tricky. Let me think: cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The carbonyl is at position 1. So the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. So adding Br to both 2 and 6 positions would give 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. Or perhaps each of those positions gets a Br, but are they both substituted?

Alternatively, perhaps each alpha position has a Br, but only one Br per alpha carbon. So each of the two alpha positions (2 and 6) would have a Br, so it's 2-bromo and 6-bromo. But wait, in cyclohexanone, the two alpha positions are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So when you add Br, you'd have two Br atoms, each on a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

So product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone, right? So moving on to the next step.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. So that's probably an elimination reaction. If product 1 has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, then heating with NaOH would likely lead to an elimination, forming a double bond. So, with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, the base (OH-) would abstract a beta proton, leading to the formation of a double bond and the loss of HBr.

Wait, but wait: product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. So positions 2 and 6 each have a Br. When heated with NaOH, which is a strong base, it would likely cause an elimination, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, perhaps? Wait, but C1 is the carbonyl. So maybe elimination between C2 and C3? Or between C1 and C2?

Wait, no, the carbonyl is at C1. So elimination would occur between C2 and C3, but wait, product 1 has Br on C2 and C6. Hmm, maybe the base will abstract a proton from C3, leading to elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, if the Br is on C6, then elimination could happen between C6 and C5? Hmm, but the ring structure complicates this.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Let's imagine cyclohexanone with the ketone at C1. Then, Br is on C2 and C6. Now, when NaOH is added, the base may deprotonate C3 (adjacent to C2), leading to elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, on the other side, the Br on C6 could lead to elimination, forming a double bond between C6 and C5.

But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring. If Br is on C2 and C6, elimination would form two double bonds? Or perhaps form a conjugated diene? Hmm, but that would require elimination in two places. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a diene, so maybe it just forms a single double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the base will abstract a proton from C3, leading to the departure of Br from C2, forming an alkene between C2 and C3. Similarly, the same thing would happen on the other side, but that would lead to a ring with two double bonds, which might not be possible. So perhaps it's more likely that one double bond forms, but that doesn't make sense because both Br atoms are present.

Wait, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, which would allow a conjugated diene after elimination. Wait, but if the two Brs are on C2 and C3, then elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, the starting material after the first reaction would have Br on adjacent carbons. Wait wait, maybe I got the first step wrong. Let me re-express cyclohexanone.

Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. The carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) are each CH2 groups. So when product 1 is formed, each of these (C2 and C6) have a Br. So the structure would be (Br)CH2-C(=O)-CH2-Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Cyclohexanone: six-membered ring, with one carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1. The two adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) are each CH2. When Br2 adds to the alpha positions, each of these CH2 groups becomes CHBr. So product 1 would have Br on C2 and C6. So structure is (Br)CH2-C(=O)-CH2-Br in the ring? No, wait, the ring is cyclohexane, so it's a six-membered ring. So in the ring, positions 2 and 6 each have a Br.

So when we heat it with NaOH, the base will abstract a proton from a carbon adjacent to a Br. Let's say the base abstracts a proton from C3 (adjacent to C2). Then, the Br on C2 leaves, and a double bond forms between C2 and C3. Similarly, the Br on C6 would cause elimination of a proton from C5, forming a double bond between C5 and C6. But wait, that would give a conjugated diene in the ring, which is a possibility.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If two Br atoms are on C2 and C6, then elimination would form double bonds between C2-C3 and C6-C5. But that would create two double bonds in the ring, which might not be possible in a six-membered ring without being conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to a double bond between C2 and C3, and the Br on C6 would eliminate as well, leading to another double bond.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, can you have two double bonds without being conjugated? Like 1,3-diene? Hmm, but that would require the ring to be non-planar, which is possible. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes a conjugated diene. Wait, but 1,3-diene in a six-membered ring would be a conjugated system. Let me think: cyclohexadiene.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a cyclohexene ring with a double bond. But if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond between them, making a cyclohexene ring with one double bond. Wait, but product 1 has Br on C2 and C6, which are across the ring from each other, not adjacent. Oh wait, in a six-membered ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the carbonyl, but they are opposite each other (para positions). So perhaps when the NaOH is added, the two Brs are on opposite sides, and elimination occurs from each, forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think about the product after elimination. If product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone, and upon heating with NaOH, each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So when the Br leaves, each elimination would form a double bond between C2-C3 and C6-C5, leading to a 1,3-diene in the ring. Wait, because the ring is six-membered, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other. So eliminating from C2 and C6 would form double bonds at C2-C3 and C6-C5, creating a conjugated diene in the ring.

Wait, but that would make a conjugated diene, which would be 1,3-cyclohexadienone? No, the carbonyl is at C1. So the ring would have a ketone at C1 and double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. That would form a conjugated diene system, but perhaps that's not possible because the ring would become too strained.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to the elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, the same process occurs on the other side, leading to a double bond between C6 and C5. So the ring would have two double bonds: C2-C3 and C5-C6. That would make a conjugated diene, but in a six-membered ring, that's possible as it's a conjugated system.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility: maybe the elimination doesn't happen on both Br atoms, only one. But why would that be the case? Because both Brs are present, and the conditions are such that elimination would occur. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can't support two double bonds, so the molecule might form a single double bond, but which one? Maybe the more substituted one.

Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the product as cyclohexanone with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, but after elimination, perhaps a single double bond forms. Then product 2 would be a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a different approach. Maybe the first reaction is bromination at the alpha position, leading to a single Br on each of the two alpha carbons. But then, when heated with NaOH, each Br undergoes elimination. So perhaps each Br is eliminated, forming two double bonds, but that doesn't seem feasible in a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps only one elimination occurs, forming a single double bond.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Another possibility is that the first reaction adds Br across the carbonyl group. So cyclohexanone (C=O) reacts with Br2 to form a dibromide. But I think that's more of an addition reaction, like in the case of alkenes. But ketones don't typically add Br2 directly. Hmm.

Wait a second, maybe the first reaction is an example of benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Michael addition? No, that's for enones.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a bromonium ion formation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe I should look up what happens when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. Oh wait, in the presence of a base, bromine can add to the alpha position. I think that's the case here. So product 1 is 2-bromo-cyclohexanone. Wait, but why only one Br? Because cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions, perhaps only one is brominated? But the reaction is with Br2, so maybe both are brominated.

So product 1 would be 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone.

Then, step 2: heating with NaOH (a base) would lead to elimination. The base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since we have Br on C2 and C6, elimination could occur from either side.

Wait, perhaps the NaOH induces an E2 elimination. So each Br leaves, with the base abstracting a proton from the adjacent carbon. So for the Br on C2, the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to double bond between C2-C3. Similarly, the Br on C6 would lead to a double bond between C6-C5.

So product 2 would have double bonds at C2-C3 and C5-C6. So that would form a conjugated diene. But wait, in a six-membered ring, that would mean the ring has two double bonds, making it a conjugated cyclohexadiene with a ketone group.

Wait, but that would make a cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one. Which is a conjugated dienone. That structure is possible. So product 2 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienone.

Moving on to step 3: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3. Thionyl chloride is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but wait, product 2 is a ketone, so perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, but product 2 is a cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, which is a ketone. So treating a ketone with SOCl2 would form an acyl chloride. So cyclohexa-2,5-dienone would react with SOCl2 to form cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride.

Wait, but wait, the double bonds are present. So the structure would be O=C-(CH2CH2) with double bonds? No, wait, it's a conjugated dienone. So, after treatment with SOCl2, the ketone (O) is replaced with Cl. So product 3 would be 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride.

Step 4: product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(LiAlH3)) to form product 4. Wait, but wait, no. LiAlH3 is typically a strong reducing agent. Wait, but if product 3 is an acid chloride, then LiAlH would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol. Wait, but wait, let's think again. The reagent is LiAlH(LiAlH3?), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, the reagent is Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which is a bulky reducing agent. It's more selective; it typically reduces esters to alcohols without reducing other groups, but in the case of acid chlorides, perhaps it would reduce the carbonyl to a CH2 group.

Wait, no, LiAlH3 (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride would be reduced to cyclohexa-2,5-dienol. Wait, no, because the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Wait, no: the structure is O=C-R, so when reduced, becomes CH2-OH? No, wait, ketone (RCOR') reduces to RCH2OR' or RCH2CH2OH? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure of product 3 is (O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-), but that's not correct. Let me correct: product 2 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone at C1 and double bonds at C2-C3 and C5-C6. So when SOCl2 is added, the ketone becomes a Cl. So product 3 is 1-chloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene.

Wait, no, the product is actually a cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride, which is a cyclic structure. So when LiAlH is used, it would reduce the carbonyl chloride to a primary alcohol. But wait, the carbonyl is part of a conjugated diene. So the structure would be O=C-(CH2-CH2), but that's not right. Let me think again.

Product 3 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride, which is a cyclic structure with the Cl at position 1 (the former ketone). So when LiAlH is used, the carbonyl (Cl) would be reduced to an alcohol. So product 4 would be cyclohexa-2,5-dienol. Wait, but cyclohexa-2,5-dienol would have an OH group at position 1, and double bonds at 2-3 and 5-6.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure. The ring has a six-membered structure with OH at C1, and double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. So the ring would look like:

O
||
C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is double-bonded to C3, and C6 is double-bonded to C5. C3 is connected to C4, which is a single bond, and C4 connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6.

Wait, but that can't be right because in a six-membered ring, having two double bonds would require conjugation. So the structure would be cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol.

So product 4 is cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So I need to analyze the structure of cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol and count the distinct Hs.

Let me draw the structure:

Positions: 1 (OH), 2 (double bond to 3), 3 (double bond to 2), 4 (single), 5 (double bond to 6), 6 (double bond to 5).

Wait, no. Let me imagine the ring as follows. Positions 1 has the OH. Then, there's a double bond between 2 and 3, and another between 5 and 6. So the ring would have double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6.

So the structure is:

Positions 1: OH
Position 2: double bond to 3
Position 3: double bond to 2
Position 4: single bond to 5
Position 5: double bond to 6
Position 6: double bond to 5

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring as a conjugated diene. So in a six-membered ring, the double bonds are at C1-C2 and C4-C5, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,3-diene. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

- C1: OH
- C2 double bond C3
- C4 single bond C5 (but C5 double bond C6)

Wait, but that would make the ring have a double bond between 2-3 and another between 5-6, which are adjacent? Hmm, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, the ring has a conjugated diene across positions 2-3-4-5, but that would require four carbons, which isn't feasible in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps, and product 4 is something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenol with a single double bond. Let me try another approach. Let me recount the reactions.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone (product 1)
2. Product 1 + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene with a ketone? Or perhaps cyclohexenone with a double bond.

Wait, maybe during the second step, the NaOH leads to the formation of cyclohexenone. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone.

Wait, but how? Let me think again. Product 1 is 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. When heated with NaOH, the base could abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. So for each Br on C2 and C6, elimination would form double bonds at C1-C2 and C1-C6? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to elimination of Br from C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Similarly, the Br on C6 would lead to elimination, forming a double bond between C6 and C5. So the ring would have two double bonds, making a conjugated diene. But that's a possibility.

If product 2 is 2,5-cyclohexadienone (conjugated dienone), then product 3 would be 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride. Then, product 4 would be 2,5-cyclohexadienol after reduction.

So now, product 4 is cyclohexa-2,5-dienol. Let's imagine its structure. The ring has a ketone at C1, which is reduced to an alcohol (OH at C1). There are double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. So the structure is a six-membered ring with OH at C1, double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6.

Now, to find the number of distinct H atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.

In product 4, the molecule is a six-membered ring with an OH group at C1, and two double bonds at C2-C3 and C5-C6. Let's number the positions:

1: OH
2: double bond to 3
3: double bond to 2
4: single bond to 5
5: double bond to 6
6: double bond to 5

But wait, that can't form a proper ring. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are between C1-C2 and C4-C5, making a conjugated diene from C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, but that would require four atoms, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C4-C5, making a conjugated diene in positions 2-3-4-5.

Wait, but that would make a four-membered conjugated system, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexene with the OH group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think of the molecule as a substituted cyclohexene. Let me try to think of the structure of product 4.

After the reduction, product 4 is an alcohol derived from the acid chloride. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group and two double bonds. Wait, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a cyclohexanol derivative with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexenol, with a double bond at position 2 and an OH at position 1. So the structure would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

In that case, the molecule would have the OH at position 1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and the rest single bonds.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C1-OH
|
C2 double bond C3
C3 connected to C4
C4 connected to C5
C5 connected to C6
C6 connected back to C1.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, a double bond between C2 and C3 would make the ring have a single double bond. So the molecule would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

Now, to count the distinct H atoms:

C1 has an OH group and is connected to C2 and C6. So the Hs on C1 (if any) would be determined by the structure. Wait, cyclohex-2-en-1-ol would have the structure:

HO-C1-C2=C3-C4-C5-C6-C1

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me structure it properly.

The ring would be:

- C1: OH attached, connected to C2 and C6.
- C2: double bond to C3.
- C3: double bond to C2, connected to C4.
- C4: connected to C5.
- C5: connected to C6.
- C6: connected to C1 and C5.

Wait, but that's a six-membered ring with C2-C3 as a double bond and OH at C1.

So, the structure is:

      O
      |
C1-OH connected to C2 and C6.

C2 is double bonded to C3.

C3 is connected to C4.

C4 is connected to C5.

C5 is connected to C6.

C6 is connected to C1 and C5.

So, the molecule is cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

Now, let's number the carbons and look for symmetry.

C1: has an OH group. The Hs on C1: in cyclohexanol, C1 is a CH2 group, but in this case, since it's cyclohexenol, perhaps C1 is a CHOH group. Wait, no, cyclohexenol would have the OH on C1, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but in cyclohexenol, C1 is CH2OH? No, perhaps not. Let me think again.

In cyclohex-2-en-1-ol, the structure is a six-membered ring where C1 is the one with the OH (so it's a secondary alcohol), and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the structure would have:

C1: -CH2-OH (if the ring is such that C1 is CH2). Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, all carbons are CH2 except possibly for substituents.

Wait, perhaps C1 is CH2OH, connected to C2 and C6.

C2 is double bonded to C3 (so C2 is CH).

C3 is double bonded to C2 (so CH as well), connected to C4.

C4 is CH2 connected to C5.

C5 is CH2 connected to C6.

C6 is CH2 connected back to C1.

Wait, but that's a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2-C3, and an OH on C1.

So, the structure would be:

Positions:

1: CH2OH

2: CH2 (but wait, double bond between 2-3, so C2 is CH-.

3: CH- (double bond to 2), connected to C4.

4: CH2 connected to C5.

5: CH2 connected to C6.

6: CH2 connected to C1.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps C2 is CH with a double bond to C3, which is also CH, connected to C4.

So the molecule would be:

C1: -CH2-OH

C2: CH2 connected to C1 and double bonded to C3.

Wait, no, C2 can't be CH2 if it's double bonded. So C2 would be CH, connected to C1 (CH2OH) and double bonded to C3 (CH).

C3: CH, connected to C2 and C4 (CH2).

C4: CH2 connected to C3 and C5 (CH2).

C5: CH2 connected to C4 and C6 (CH2).

C6: CH2 connected to C5 and C1 (CH2OH).

Wait, but in this case, C2 and C3 are each CH groups, and the rest are CH2.

So, the structure is a cyclohexene with the double bond between C2 and C3, and an OH group on C1.

Now, to determine the number of distinct H atoms.

Let's analyze each carbon:

C1: CH2OH. The two Hs on C1 are equivalent because the molecule is symmetrical around the plane passing through C1 and the double bond. So the two Hs on C1 are equivalent, but wait, with the double bond, maybe they're not. Wait, no, because the double bond is between C2 and C3, which are adjacent to C1. So the structure is such that C1 is attached to C2 (CH) and C6 (CH2).

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the molecule may have some symmetry. Let's imagine looking at C1, which is attached to C2 (double bond) and C6 (single bond). The molecule may not have a plane of symmetry, leading to all Hs being distinct.

But perhaps not. Let's think about each position's Hs.

C1: CH2OH. The two Hs are on the same carbon. Are they equivalent? Since the molecule is not symmetrical, these Hs might be equivalent because they're on the same carbon and the substituents are arranged symmetrically? Or perhaps not. Wait, since the molecule has a double bond, maybe the Hs on C1 are equivalent due to the plane of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the Hs on C1 are all equivalent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this by considering each H's environment.

1. C1: attached to OH and two CH2 groups (C2 and C6). So the Hs on C1 are in the same environment. So each H on C1 is the same. So one unique H.

2. C2: attached to C1 (CH2OH), double bonded to C3. So the Hs on C2, if any, would be on the same side of the double bond. Wait, but C2 is a CH group with a double bond, so it has no Hs attached. Because in a double bond, the carbons are each bonded to two other atoms (like in an alkene). So C2 has no Hs.

Wait, no: in an alkene, each C is bonded to two other Cs and two Hs (if it's a CH2 group). Wait, no, if it's a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond, then:

Wait, no, in the structure I described earlier, C2 is CH, with a single bond to C1 (CH2OH) and a double bond to C3 (CH). So C2 has one H attached. Similarly, C3 has one H attached.

So, C2 has one H, and C3 has one H.

Are these Hs equivalent? Since the molecule is cyclohexene with the double bond between C2 and C3, and an OH on C1, the Hs on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps leading them to be non-equivalent.

3. C4: connected to C3 (CH) and C5 (CH2). So C4 is a CH2 group. The two Hs on C4 would be equivalent if the ring is symmetrical.

But in this molecule, the ring isn't symmetrical because of the OH group on C1 and the double bond. So the Hs on C4 would be in a different environment than those on C5 or C6.

Wait, C4 is connected to C3 (CH) and C5 (CH2). So C4 is a CH2 group, but its position in the ring may make its Hs unique.

4. C5: connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). So C5 is a CH2 group. The Hs here may be unique as well.

5. C6: connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH2OH). So C6 is a CH2 group. The Hs here may be unique.

So, let's count:

- C1: 2 Hs (but are they equivalent? Since the molecule isn't symmetrical, the two Hs might be different. Or perhaps they are the same. If C1 is CH2OH, the two Hs are on the same carbon and possibly equivalent. So maybe one unique H here.

- C2: 1 H, unique.

- C3: 1 H, unique.

- C4: 2 Hs, but are they equivalent? If the ring is such that C4 is adjacent to the double bond, maybe the Hs are equivalent. Or perhaps not, due to the asymmetry caused by the OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Hs on C4 are in the same environment, making them equivalent. So one unique H for C4.

- C5: 2 Hs, perhaps equivalent, so one unique H.

- C6: 2 Hs, perhaps equivalent, so one unique H.

Wait, but let's think again about each position.

C1: CH2OH. The two Hs are on the same carbon. Are they equivalent? Since the substituents around the ring are not symmetrical, the Hs on C1 would be in different environments, but wait, looking from the C1, the two Hs are on the same carbon and attached to the same groups, so they are equivalent. So C1 contributes one unique H.

C2: CH group. One H, which is in a unique environment because it's attached to a double bond and adjacent to C1 (CH2OH). So this H is unique.

C3: CH group. One H, attached to a double bond and adjacent to C4 (CH2). Since the molecule isn't symmetrical, this H is unique.

C4: CH2 group. Are the two Hs on C4 equivalent? The groups around C4 are CH3 (no, C4 is connected to C3 and C5, which are CH and CH2, respectively). So the two Hs on C4 are in the same environment. So one unique H here.

C5: CH2 group. Connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). So the two Hs here are equivalent. One unique H.

C6: CH2 group. Connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH2OH). So the two Hs are in the same environment, making them equivalent. One unique H.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing some aspects. Let me count this again.

C1: 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: 1 H → unique.

C3: 1 H → unique.

C4: 2 Hs → unique.

C5: 2 Hs → unique.

C6: 2 Hs → unique.

Adding them up: 1 + 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 6 unique Hs. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't include 6 as the correct answer for this problem. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: perhaps product 4 is not a cyclohexene but a different structure.

Wait, maybe during the reduction step (step 4), the acid chloride is reduced to a primary alcohol, but the double bonds are lost. No, because the acid chloride is part of a conjugated system, and the reducing conditions might not affect the double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't affect the double bonds, so they remain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of product 4 is different. Let me think again.

Wait, let's retrace the steps.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone.

2. 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone + NaOH → elimination to form 2,5-cyclohexadienone.

3. 2,5-cyclohexadienone + SOCl2 → 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride.

4. 2,5-cyclohexadienoyl chloride + LiAlH → reduction to 2,5-cyclohexadienol.

So the structure is cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol.

In this structure, the ring has double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6, and an OH group at C1.

Now, let's count the distinct Hs:

C1: OH attached. So C1 is CH2OH.

Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So C1 is attached to C2 and C6, and has the OH.

So, C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs, which are equivalent.

C2: double bond to C3, so C2 is CH. So it has one H attached.

C3: double bond to C2 → CH. One H attached.

C4: single bonds to C3 and C5 → CH2. Two Hs.

C5: double bond to C6 → CH. One H.

C6: double bond to C5 → CH. One H.

So, the Hs are:

C1: 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: 1 H → unique.

C3: 1 H → unique.

C4: 2 Hs → 1 unique (since both are in the same environment).

C5: 1 H → unique.

C6: 1 H → unique.

Total: 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) +1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 6 unique Hs.

But this would give 6, which is option A. But earlier, I thought the correct answer is 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed some Hs. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on C4 are not equivalent. Because C4 is between two CH groups (C3 and C5), but C3 is part of a double bond, and C5 is part of a double bond. So the Hs on C4 might be in a unique environment.

Wait, but in a cyclohexadiene ring, the double bonds are conjugated. So the ring is flat, and the molecule is planar. So for C4, which is between two CH groups, perhaps the two Hs are equivalent.

So, that would give 1 (C1) +1 (C2) +1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 6.

But the options have 6 as option A, which would be the answer, but earlier I thought the answer was 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternative possibility: perhaps during the elimination step (step 2), only one Br is eliminated, forming a single double bond. Let me reevaluate.

If product 1 is 2-bromo-cyclohexanone, then step 2 would eliminate to form cyclohexenone. So product 2 is cyclohexenone.

Then, step 3: cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Step 4: cyclohexenoyl chloride + LiAlH → cyclohexenol.

In this case, product 4 would be cyclohexenol, with an OH group and a single double bond.

So the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol or cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

Let me consider cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

So, the structure is:

C1: OH attached, connected to C2 and C6.

C2: double bond to C3 → CH.

C3: double bond to C2 → CH, connected to C4.

C4: connected to C3 and C5 → CH2.

C5: connected to C4 and C6 → CH2.

C6: connected to C5 and C1 → CH2.

So, Hs:

C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: CH → 1 H.

C3: CH → 1 H.

C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

So, 1 (C1) +1 (C2) +1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 6 unique Hs.

But that again leads to 6, which is option A.

But I'm supposed to pick the correct answer, which I think is 8, but perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination leads to a geminal dibromide. Let me think: when Br2 is added to the alpha position, perhaps it adds to the same carbon, leading to 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

If that's the case, then product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Then, step 2: heating with NaOH would cause elimination, leading to the loss of two Br atoms and the formation of a double bond.

So, product 2 would be cyclohexenone, with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Then, step 3: cyclohexenone → cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Step 4: reduction to cyclohexenol.

In this case, product 4 is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

In this structure, the Hs would be:

C1: CH2 connected to C2 (CH) and C6 (CH2).

C2: CH2OH (if C2 is the OH group), but no, in this case, OH is at C2.

Wait, let's structure it correctly. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and OH is at C1, then product 4 would be cyclohex-1-en-1-ol, which isn't possible because that would imply adjacent OH and double bond, which isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is at C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So, the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

In this case, C2 has the OH group and is connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

So, the structure would be:

C1: double bond to C2, connected to C6.

C2: OH attached, connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

C3: connected to C2 and C4 → CH2.

C4: connected to C3 and C5 → CH2.

C5: connected to C4 and C6 → CH2.

C6: connected to C5 and C1 → CH2.

Now, the Hs:

C1: CH (double bond to C2 and connected to C6). So C1 has no Hs attached.

C2: CH(OH) → one H attached.

C3: CH2 → two Hs.

C4: CH2 → two Hs.

C5: CH2 → two Hs.

C6: CH2 → two Hs.

So, counting:

C1: 0 Hs.

C2: 1 H → unique.

C3: 2 Hs → are they equivalent? Since C3 is connected to C2 (OH) and C4 (CH2), perhaps the two Hs are equivalent. So 1 unique.

C4: 2 Hs → connected to C3 (CH2) and C5 (CH2). Are these Hs equivalent? If the ring is symmetrical around C4, then yes. So 1 unique.

C5: 2 Hs → connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). So 1 unique.

C6: 2 Hs → connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH). Are these Hs equivalent? Since C1 has no Hs, and C6 is connected to C5 (CH2) and C1 (CH), perhaps the two Hs are equivalent. So 1 unique.

Adding up: 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) +1 (C4) +1 (C5) +1 (C6) = 5 unique Hs. But that doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some Hs. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has more symmetry, leading to fewer unique Hs.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the final product is 1,2-cyclohexanediol or something similar. No, that doesn't fit the reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial bromination adds Br across the carbonyl, making a dibromide. Then, elimination forms a conjugated diene.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think of the possible answer options.

The options are 6, 8, 10, 7.

If product 4 is a benzene ring, the number of Hs would be different, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps product 4 has a tricyclic structure, but no, the starting material is cyclohexanone.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction steps, the ring opens, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps during the reduction, the double bonds are hydrogenated, so product 4 is a cyclohexanol derivative without double bonds.

But no, the reducing agent (LiAlH) typically doesn't hydrogenate double bonds unless it's a very strong condition. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds remain.

Wait, LiAlH is a hydride source and is used for reductions. Acid chlorides are reduced to alcohols. It's possible that the double bonds are not affected under these conditions.

So, perhaps product 4 is a cyclohexene with an OH group.

Assuming that, the number of distinct Hs would be 6, but the options include 6 as A.

But the options given are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try an alternative approach.

Alternative approach after step 3:

Product 3 is an acid chloride, which upon reduction would form an alcohol. But if the acid chloride is part of a conjugated system, perhaps the reduction adds Hs in a way that produces more Hs.

Wait, but regardless, the main point is to count the Hs in product 4.

Another thought: perhaps product 4 is a diol, but that would require a dihydroxylation, which isn't part of the steps given.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step forms a single double bond, leading to a less substituted structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial elimination forms a cyclohexenone, which upon treatment with SOCl2 forms a chloroketone, and then upon reduction, becomes a cyclohexenol.

In that case, the structure would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

In this structure, the Hs would be:

C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C2: CH → 1 H.

C3: CH → 1 H.

C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

Total: 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 unique Hs.

But the options have 6 as A. So why would the correct answer be 8?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some Hs. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. If the elimination step forms a diene, then the number of Hs might increase due to the more complex structure.

If product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadienone, then product 4 would be 1,3-cyclohexadienol.

In that case, the structure would have double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4.

But then, the counting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 4 has more substituents leading to more distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the final structure as a bicyclic compound, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial bromination leads to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the elimination, product 2 is a cyclohexene, and then product 3 is a cyclohexenoyl chloride, and product 4 is cyclohexenol.

In that case, the structure would be cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

In this structure, the Hs are as follows:

- C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C2: CH → 1 H.

- C3: CH → 1 H.

- C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

Total: 6 unique Hs.

But the options don't have 6 as the correct answer for this problem, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination is different. Maybe instead of adding Br to the alpha positions, it's adding across the carbonyl group, forming a bromohydrin.

Wait, when ketones react with bromine in a specific condition, they can form a bromohydrin via the hydrobromic acid addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a dihydroxylation, but that's more typical with other reagents.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is 8, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has more substituents leading to more distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 has a geminal diol, but that would require oxidation, which isn't part of these steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial bromination adds Br across the carbonyl, leading to a diepoxide, but no, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, which isn't reactive enough for SN2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the final structure as a bicyclic compound with more substituents, but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)7.

Wait, perhaps in the structure, there are seven distinct Hs.

How?

If product 4 is a cyclohexene with an OH group, perhaps the structure leads to seven distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some Hs.

Let me try to count again with this structure:

Cyclohex-2-en-1-ol.

- C1: CH2OH → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C2: CH → 1 H.

- C3: CH → 1 H.

- C4: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C5: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

- C6: CH2 → 2 Hs → 1 unique.

Total: 6 unique Hs. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6, which is option A.

But earlier I thought the answer was 8, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure after the elimination is different. If product 2 is a different dienone, leading to a more complex structure in product 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination adds Br to the same carbon, leading to a geminal dibromide, which upon elimination forms a more substituted double bond.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, I think the final product has 6 distinct Hs. So the answer is A)6.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending with product 4, and the goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha positions (C2 and C6), forming 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone. Each alpha carbon (C2 and C6) gains a bromine atom.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH → Product 2**  
   Heating 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone with NaOH induces an elimination reaction. The base abstracts a proton from a beta carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. The elimination occurs at both C2 and C6, forming a conjugated diene in the ring. The resulting product is cyclohexa-2,5-dienone.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   The ketone group in cyclohexa-2,5-dienone reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form the corresponding acid chloride, cyclohexa-2,5-dienoyl chloride.

4. **Reaction 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (a strong reducing agent) reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The resulting product is cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ol, which has an OH group at C1, double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6, and single bonds elsewhere.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - **C1**: The OH group is attached to C1, which is a CH₂ group. The two hydrogens on C1 are equivalent, contributing 1 unique hydrogen.  
   - **C2**: C2 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  
   - **C3**: C3 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  
   - **C4**: C4 is a CH₂ group with two hydrogens. These hydrogens are equivalent, contributing 1 unique hydrogen.  
   - **C5**: C5 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  
   - **C6**: C6 is a CH group with one hydrogen, which is unique due to its position adjacent to the double bond.  

   Adding these contributions:  
   1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 1 (C6) = **6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **6**.
