Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem involves several reactions starting from cyclohexanone. I'll need to track each transformation to find out what the final product looks like, especially focusing on the number of distinct hydrogen atoms.

First, cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. I remember that bromine can add across double bonds in a dibromination reaction. But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone. Oh wait, no, the bromine addition is more likely in a different context. Wait, maybe it's an example of a halogenation reaction. Oh, wait, wait. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, and when you add bromine under certain conditions, it might undergo a bromohydrination. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? No, that's for dienes. Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a substitution reaction. No, bromine is typically for addition in alkenes. Wait, wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Hmm. Oh wait! I think when ketones like cyclohexanone react with bromine (Br2), it's an example of the haloform reaction. Wait, no, the haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone is treated with bromine in the presence of a base, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid and a haloform. But cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone. So that might not apply here.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is an addition. Oh, wait! Maybe I'm mixing things up. So cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Maybe the bromine adds to the carbonyl group. Wait, but the carbonyl is already a double bond between C=O. So adding Br2... Oh wait, no, it's more likely that the carbonyl is attacked, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination via a different mechanism. Hmm, maybe it's an example of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that's for alpha bromination of carboxylic acids, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromination via enol formation. Oh! That makes more sense. So in the presence of an acid, cyclohexanone can form an enol, and then bromine (Br2) would add across the conjugated double bond. So the first step is the addition of Br2 to the enol form of cyclohexanone. That would form a dibromide. Let me think: the enol would have a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, so adding Br2 would give a 1,2-dibromo derivative on those carbons.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: when cyclohexanone reacts with excess bromine, it could undergo a ring-opening. No, that's more for epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a benzilic acid rearrangement? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a diene.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. So cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Adding bromine could lead to the formation of a bromocyclohexanol, but that's more with other conditions like in the presence of a base. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is added to the carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a bromoketone. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a 1,2-diol.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about this again. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Adding Br2 under certain conditions might result in a bromohydrin. Wait, but bromohydrin formation is typically with aqueous Br2 and a base. Alternatively, if there's no water, maybe it's just adding Br across the carbonyl. Oh wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so adding Br2 would add across it. So in that case, cyclohexanone (which is a cyclic ketone with six-membered ring) would have the carbonyl group (O=C-) in the ring. Adding Br2 would add Br across the C=O, making O-C-Br and Br-C-O. Wait, but that can't happen because the carbonyl is a polar group. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a typical addition to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl (C=O) would react with Br2, but I'm not sure if that's a common reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). If those are brominated, that would add Br atoms there.

But under what conditions does that happen? The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction brominates alpha positions of carboxylic acids, but cyclohexanone is a ketone. Alternatively, using a Lewis acid catalyst like FeBr3 could cause bromination, but that's more for aromatic substitution. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone isn't aromatic. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the initial step is the formation of a bromocyclohexane through a radical mechanism. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromonium ion formation, but that's more for alkenes.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about what product 1 is. If the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, that would convert the ketone into a di bromide. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so adding Br2 would break the ring? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of a bromoketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm confusing this with another reaction. Another possibility is that when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, it undergoes a ring-opening. For example, in the case of epoxides, bromine can open the ring, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a simple addition of Br to the carbonyl, but I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by Br, but that would require a very strong condition, like HBr with a peroxide, but that's usually for alkenes.

Hmm, maybe the first reaction is a conjugate addition. Oh! Wait, cyclohexanone has a conjugated double bond system. So when bromine is added, it could undergo 1,4-addition. But I'm not sure about that because cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a carbonyl, so the conjugation is limited.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of cyclohexenone bromide. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next steps. Product 1 is treated with NaOH upon heating. So maybe product 1 is a dibromide. Then, heating with NaOH suggests a possible elimination reaction, like E2. So if product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, heating with NaOH would cause elimination, forming an alkene. That would make sense.

So, if product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, then product 2 would be an alkene.

Wait, but how did we get the dibromide from cyclohexanone? Oh! Perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl. Wait, but that would mean adding two Brs across the C=O bond, which would form a geminal dibromide. But let me think: cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone. Adding Br2 would add across the C=O, which would make O=CBr2, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps it's a bromide addition like in the case of ketones. Wait, maybe it's an example of the haloform reaction, but as I thought earlier, that requires a methyl ketone. So cyclohexanone is not a methyl ketone, so that's not possible.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm wrong about product 1. Let me consider another approach. Maybe the first step is the formation of a brominated cyclohexanol. So, adding HBr in a certain way. Wait, but that's more substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a di bromide through some other mechanism. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a bromination via the enol intermediate. So, when cyclohexanone is treated with aqueous HBr, it can form an enol which then adds Br, leading to a vicinal di bromide. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: So product 1 is treated with NaOH and heated to form product 2. If product 1 is a dibromide, then product 2 would be an alkene formed via elimination. For example, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, heating with NaOH would eliminate HBr and form cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring, so product 2 would be cyclohexene? No, wait, cyclohexene would be a ring with a double bond, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Wait, no, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then elimination would produce cyclohexene. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Wait, but then the next step is treatment with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, or alcohols to chlorides. So if product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene, what would happen when treated with SOCl2?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recap:

1. Cyclohexanone → treated with Br2 → product 1.
2. Product 1 heated with NaOH → product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → product 3.
4. Product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step.

Step 1: Reaction of cyclohexanone with Br2.

Another possibility: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine in a non-polar solvent, leading to the formation of a bromoketone. Wait, but how? Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of an alpha bromination. So, the alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl) would get brominated.

Wait, how does alpha bromination happen in ketones? I think in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, like FeBr3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's through a radical mechanism.

Wait, but without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a simple substitution. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group, which is a good electrophile. Maybe Br2 adds as a di electrophile, leading to a geminal dibromide. So product 1 would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane.

But wait, 1,1-dibromocyclohexane would have two Br atoms on the same carbon. Then, step two is heating with NaOH. That would likely lead to elimination, but with two Brs on the same carbon, elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, but the structure of cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with one carbonyl group. So when Br2 adds, perhaps forming a geminal dibromide, then elimination would form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but product 2 would then be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Because the elimination would form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, that might make more sense. So product 1 is a geminal dibromide, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Let me see: So cyclohexanone (with structure (CH2)5CO) → reacts with Br2 to form (CH2)5CBr2O. Then, heating with NaOH would cause elimination, removing H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone, where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

But wait, cyclohexenone would have a structure like (CH2)4C=CH-CO, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps the product 2 is actually a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. But I'm not entirely certain about this.

Moving on to step 3: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.

If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, treating with SOCl2 would typically convert any hydroxyl groups to chlorides. But in this case, product 2 is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that product 2 has an alcohol group, but that doesn't fit with the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene. Then, treating with SOCl2 could do what? Well, SOCl2 is used to convert alcohols to chlorides, but for alkenes, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a chlorination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an alkyl chloride. So if product 2 is an alkene, maybe there's a dienophile involved, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 2 is a diol, but I don't think so. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in step 1, product 1 is a vicinal di bromide, and in step 2, elimination forms an alkene, product 2.

So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, step 3 is treating with SOCl2. Hmm, I'm not sure what reaction would occur between an alkene and SOCl2. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has an alcohol group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the first reaction is the formation of a bromide at the alpha position.

Wait, let's assume that product 1 is alpha-bromo cyclohexanone. Then, step 2 is treating with NaOH, which could lead to elimination, forming an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, step 3 would be treating with SOCl2. If product 2 is an enone, then treating with SOCl2 might not do anything because there's no OH group. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted to an acid chloride, but that's not likely without an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an acid chloride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step again.

Let me try to approach this systematically.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Possible reactions for ketones with Br2:

1. Alpha bromination: introduces Br at the alpha position (CH2 adjacent to carbonyl). This could be via enol formation and then bromine addition. So product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone.

2. Addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group: unlikely because that would require breaking the C=O, which is possible but would form a geminal dibromide (O=CBr2), which is not a stable structure. I think this is not the case.

3. Another possibility: cyclohexanone could undergo a ring-opening with Br2 in an acidic environment, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I think the most plausible is alpha bromination. So product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: Product 1 (3-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with NaOH. This is likely an elimination reaction. The NaOH would deprotonate and abstract a proton beta to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So product 2 is cyclohexenone, specifically, 3-en-1-one cyclohexane, or something like that.

Step 3: Product 2 (the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine. What does SOCl2 do here? Typically, it converts carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but in this case, the compound is a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's converting an alcohol to a chloride, but product 2 is a ketone, not an alcohol. Wait, perhaps product 2 has an -OH group. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is 3-cyclohexenone, which is the same as cyclohex-1-en-3-one. Then, treating with SOCl2 and pyridine—what's that do? Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like condensation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is being converted into an acid chloride, but that would require an acid, which I don't think is present here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe product 3 is an acid chloride, but without an acid, that's not likely. Alternatively, if product 2 has an -OH group, but I don't see where that would come from.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps step 2 produces a diol. No, I don't think so because the elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about product 2. Let me re-examine step 2. If product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then heating with NaOH would cause elimination, removing two Brs and forming a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: treating cyclohexene with SOCl2. Hmm, I'm not sure what reaction would happen there. Maybe it's a diaddition? Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene doesn't react with SOCl2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a chlorination of the double bond, but I don't think that's a typical reaction.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene, and product 3 is the chlorohydrin. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a different reaction. Let's think: SOCl2 is used to convert alcohols to chlorides and ketones to acid chlorides, but under certain conditions. So if product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene, treating with SOCl2 might not do anything, but that doesn't fit with the steps leading to product 4.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the overall process.

The final step is treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent. But wait, no, actually, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is typically a milder reducing agent, used for specific reductions, like in the case of esters or other carbonyl groups, but it's known for being selective. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different hydride source.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 3 is an acid chloride because product 2 is a ketone, and SOCl2 converts it. But I'm not sure. Let me proceed with that assumption.

Assuming product 3 is an acid chloride (R-COCl), then treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would reduce the acid chloride to the corresponding alcohol. Wait, but LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent that reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols, but I'm not sure about the selective hydride agent. Alternatively, perhaps the hydride reduces the acid chloride to a ketone.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, then treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 (which is a bulky hydride agent) would likely reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. But wait, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is known for its ability to reduce esters and amides selectively, but I'm not certain about acid chlorides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone to alcohol reduction.

But if product 4 is an alcohol, then the structure would have an -OH group, and we need to count the distinct hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but let me try to retrace all steps with this assumption.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 3-bromocyclohexanone (product 1).

Step 2: 3-bromocyclohexanone, heated with NaOH → elimination forms cyclohexenone (product 2).

Step 3: cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → converts the ketone to an acid chloride, so product 3 is cyclohexenone chloride (R-COCl).

Step 4: product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. Wait, but LiAlH4 typically reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols, but I'm not sure if the bulky hydride would do the same. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone reduction.

Wait, but if product 3 is R-COCl, then LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. So the product would be R-CH2-OH, but wait, no. Wait, LiAlH4 reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols, but LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a weaker hydride source. Or is it a stronger one? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an aldehyde, but I don't see how that would happen.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's think of another possibility.

Wait, what if product 3 is a chloroalkane. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexene, and then treated with SOCl2, perhaps it adds across the double bond. Wait, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene reacts with SOCl2 in a Diels-Alder-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, if product 2 is an alkene, then treating with SOCl2 might not do much. That doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I should think about the entire process. So, the steps are:

1. Add Br2 to cyclohexanone → product 1.

2. Heat product 1 with NaOH → product 2.

3. Treat product 2 with SOCl2 and pyridine → product 3.

4. Treat product 3 with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Let me think about each step again, perhaps starting from the end.

The last step is treatment with a strong reducing agent. If product 3 is an ester or an acid chloride, then the hydride would reduce it. Alternatively, maybe product 3 is an acid, which would be reduced to a primary alcohol. But without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is:

- Cyclohexanone to an alcohol via several steps.

Let me try to think of each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → maybe bromohydrin formation. Wait, bromohydrin is the addition of Br and OH across the double bond. But cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait another approach: Maybe the reaction is a diels-alder, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a bromide substitution. Wait, but the starting material is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the overall product of these steps.

Suppose all steps are leading to cyclohexanol. Then, product 4 is cyclohexanol, which has six distinct H atoms (since it's a chair with axial and equatorial Hs, but in cyclohexanol, the OH is axial or equatorial, leading to different environments). Wait, no, cyclohexanol has multiple distinct Hs. Let me think: cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The Hs adjacent to the OH would be in different environments than the others. Let me count:

The OH is on a carbon. The adjacent carbons (two on each side) would each have two Hs, but in different environments. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has several unique Hs.

But perhaps I'm way off and should think again.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 3-bromocyclohexanone (alpha bromination).

2. 3-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexenone (3-en-1-one cyclohexane).

3. Cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → conversion to acid chloride. So cyclohexenone would become cyclohexenoyl chloride.

4. Cyclohexenoyl chloride + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduction to cyclohexanol.

Wait, does LiAlH(t-Bu)3 reduce acid chlorides? I think LiAlH4 does, but perhaps the bulky hydride would selectively reduce it. So if product 4 is cyclohexanol, how many distinct H's are there?

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with one OH group. Let me draw the structure. The OH is on carbon 1. Then, each of the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) have two Hs each. But in the ring, the Hs on C2 and C6 would be in equivalent environments if the ring is symmetric. Wait, no, if the ring is chair conformation, the axial and equatorial positions matter.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the symmetry. Let's imagine cyclohexanol in a chair conformation, with the OH in the axial position. Then, the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) would each have two Hs, but in different environments. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric, so some Hs are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has multiple equivalent Hs. Let me count:

- The OH is on C1. C1 has two Hs (assuming substitution; but in reality, cyclohexanol has C1 with two Hs and an OH).

Wait, no, in cyclohexanol, each carbon in the ring has two Hs except the one bearing the OH, which has one H and the OH. So in the ring, C1 has one H, C2 and C6 have two Hs each, and C3 and C5 have two Hs each, while C4 has two Hs.

Wait, but in terms of distinct Hs, the axial and equatorial positions can lead to different environments.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure. If the OH is axial, then the adjacent Hs (on C2 and C6) are axial and equatorial. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple distinct Hs due to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to imagine the structure and count the distinct Hs.

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The molecule is not symmetric because the OH is a substituent. So the positions are as follows:

- C1: OH group, one H.

- C2 and C6: each have two Hs, but their environments are different from each other and from C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the OH and the opposite carbon. So C2 and C6 are mirror images. Similarly, C3 and C5 are mirror images, and C4 is the same on both sides.

But for Hs, that would mean that Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent, as are those on C3 and C5. So, let's count:

- C1: 1 H (distinct).

- C2: two Hs, but since C2 and C6 are equivalent, their Hs are in the same environment. So two Hs, but they are the same as C6's two Hs. So that's one type.

- C3: two Hs, same as C5's, so another type.

- C4: two Hs, same on both sides.

Wait, but wait, the Hs on C2 and C6: Each C has two Hs. But in the chair conformation, are the axial and equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 in the same environment?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the number of distinct Hs in the molecule. In cyclohexanol, the Hs are as follows:

- The H on C1 is unique.

- The Hs on C2 (axial and equatorial) may be unique, but perhaps in the chair form, the axial H is in a different environment than the equatorial. Similarly for C6.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 6 distinct Hs. Or maybe 7.

Wait, another approach: The number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol. Each carbon in the ring has two Hs except C1. Let's think about the structure:

C1: OH, one H.

C2: two Hs, which are adjacent to the OH.

C3: two Hs, next to C2.

C4: two Hs, opposite the OH.

C5: two Hs, next to C4.

C6: two Hs, next to C5 and adjacent to C1.

Wait, but since the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the OH and C4, the Hs on C2 and C6 are mirror images. Similarly, C3 and C5 are mirror images. C4's Hs are symmetric.

So, the distinct Hs would be:

- C1: one H.

- C2 and C6: each have two Hs, but in the same environment as each other because of symmetry. So each C has two Hs, but they are equivalent between C2 and C6. So that's two types: one for the axial and one for the equatorial. Or perhaps not. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps all the Hs are in unique environments. Let me think. Each H is in a different position relative to the substituents. For example, the H on C1 is unique. The Hs on C2 adjacent to C1 are unique as well. The Hs on C3 are adjacent to C2, which is adjacent to C1, making them unique. Similarly, the Hs on C4 are opposite the OH, which is a different environment. So perhaps each H is unique.

But that would give a total of 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C4) + 2 (C5) + 2 (C6) → but that's 1 + (2*5) = 11, which can't be right because the options don't go that high.

Wait, I must be making a mistake. Let me think more carefully.

In cyclohexanol, the structure has a six-membered ring. The OH is at one position, say position 1. Then, each adjacent carbon (2 and 6) has two Hs each. But due to the ring's symmetry, the Hs on C2 and C6 are mirror images. So the Hs on C2 are equivalent to those on C6. Similarly, the Hs on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The Hs on C4 are in a symmetric position.

So, the distinct Hs would be:

- C1: 1 H (distinct).

- C2 and C6: each have two Hs, but in the same environment, so that's two types: axial and equatorial. Or perhaps each carbon's Hs are in a different environment.

Wait, no, in the chair conformation, each axial and equatorial H is in a different environment. So C2 has two axial Hs and two equatorial Hs, but in reality, each C has only two Hs. Let me get this straight.

Wait, each carbon in cyclohexane normally has two Hs. In cyclohexanol, the C1 has one H and an OH. The other Cs each have two Hs. But in the chair form, the axial and equatorial positions are different.

So, in cyclohexanol, the Hs on C2:

- The axial H is in a different environment than the equatorial H on the same C.

Similarly for C6, its axial H is in a different environment than its equatorial H. But due to symmetry, the axial H on C2 is the same as the axial H on C6? No, because they are on different positions relative to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on C2 axial and equatorial are unique, and likewise for C6. Similarly, the Hs on C3 and C5 are unique, and the Hs on C4 are unique.

But this is getting too detailed, and I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to count the distinct Hs based on the chair conformation.

In the chair conformation of cyclohexanol:

- C1 has an axial OH and one axial H, but wait, no. Wait, in the chair, the OH is axial, so the H on C1 is equatorial.

Wait, no, the chair has C1 with the OH in the axial position. So the H on C1 is in the equatorial position. Then, the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) have Hs in axial and equatorial positions.

So, for C2:

- One axial H.

- One equatorial H.

Same for C6.

For C3:

- One axial H.

- One equatorial H.

Same for C5.

For C4:

- Two equatorial Hs (since it's opposite the OH, so axial position is empty).

So, the distinct Hs would be:

- C1: 1 H (equatorial).

- C2 axial: 1 H.

- C2 equatorial: 1 H.

- C6 axial: same as C2 axial.

- C6 equatorial: same as C2 equatorial.

Wait, no, because C2 and C6 are adjacent to the OH, their axial and equatorial Hs would be in different environments. So, are the axial Hs on C2 and C6 the same? Or are they different?

No, because they are in different positions relative to the substituent. So, C2 axial and C6 axial are in different environments. Similarly, their equatorial Hs are different.

Wait, but that would lead to more distinct Hs than I can imagine.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent. For example, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4. So, the Hs on C2 axial and C6 axial are mirror images and thus equivalent. Similarly, the equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent.

But the Hs on C3 and C5 would also be mirror images. So:

- C1: 1 H (equatorial).

- C2 axial and C6 axial: same environment → 1 type.

- C2 equatorial and C6 equatorial: same environment → 1 type.

- C3 axial and C5 axial: same environment → 1 type.

- C3 equatorial and C5 equatorial: same environment → 1 type.

- C4: two equatorial Hs → same environment → 1 type.

So total distinct Hs: C1 (1) + C2 axial (1) + C2 equatorial (1) + C3 axial (1) + C3 equatorial (1) + C4 (1).

Wait, that's 6 distinct H types. But let me count:

1. C1 equatorial H.

2. C2 axial H.

3. C2 equatorial H.

4. C3 axial H.

5. C3 equatorial H.

6. C4 equatorial H.

Wait, that's 6. But wait, the options don't have 6 as the correct answer. Or do they? The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product might not be cyclohexanol. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps product 4 isn't cyclohexanol. Let me think again.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, and product 4 is the reduction product, which would be a primary alcohol. So, let's say product 3 is RCOCl, and product 4 is RCH2OH?

Wait, no, because the reduction of an acid chloride (RCOCl) with LiAlH4 (or a similar reagent) would give RCH2OH. Wait, no, LiAlH4 typically reduces RCOCl to RCH2OH? Or to RCH2Li? Wait, no, I think the reduction of an acid chloride with LiAlH4 gives a primary alcohol.

Wait, so if product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride (assuming that's the structure), then product 4 would be cyclohexanol. Then, as I thought earlier, the number of distinct Hs would be 6.

But wait, in cyclohexanol, the Hs on C2 and C6 are each in two environments (axial and equatorial), so each has two distinct Hs. So for C2: 2 Hs, but both are in different environments.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that due to symmetry, some of these Hs would be equivalent. So, perhaps the correct count is 7.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again about the structure of cyclohexanol.

In the chair conformation, the OH is axial. Each adjacent carbon (C2 and C6) has one axial and one equatorial H.

So, the Hs on C2:

- Axial H: pointing upwards.

- Equatorial H: pointing outwards.

Similarly for C6.

In this case, the axial Hs on C2 and C6 are in equivalent environments, so they'd be the same. Similarly, the equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent. So that's two types of Hs from C2 and C6.

Then, moving further down the ring, C3 and C5 each have axial and equatorial Hs. Are these equivalent? Because the ring is symmetric, the axial H on C3 is equivalent to the axial H on C5, and the equatorial H on C3 is equivalent to that on C5. So that's two more types.

C4 has two equatorial Hs, which are equivalent. So that's one more type.

C1 has one equatorial H.

So, the distinct Hs are:

1. C1 equatorial.

2. C2 and C6 axial.

3. C2 and C6 equatorial.

4. C3 and C5 axial.

5. C3 and C5 equatorial.

6. C4 equatorial.

That's 6 distinct types. But wait, another possibility: The axial H on C2 and C6 are in different environments because their positions relative to the substituent (OH) are different. So they might not be equivalent.

Wait, but considering the molecule's symmetry, the plane of symmetry passes through the OH and C4. So for C2 and C6, the axial H on C2 is on one side of the plane, and the axial H on C6 is on the other. Due to the plane of symmetry, these two axial Hs are mirror images and thus equivalent. Similarly, their equatorial Hs are also equivalent.

So, for C2 and C6:

- Axial Hs: same.

- Equatorial Hs: same.

Similarly, C3 and C5 have equivalent axial and equatorial Hs.

So, the distinct Hs are:

1. C1: 1.

2. C2 axial: 1.

3. C2 equatorial: 1.

4. C3 axial: 1.

5. C3 equatorial: 1.

6. C4: 1.

Total: 6.

But wait, the options include 7. So perhaps I missed one.

Wait, perhaps C4 has two distinct Hs. Because in the chair conformation, the two equatorial Hs on C4 are in different environments. No, wait, in the chair, each equatorial H is in a different position. Alternatively, maybe the two Hs on C4 are equivalent, as they're both equatorial and symmetric.

Hmm, but that would make C4 contribute one type. So 6 types in total.

But the options have 7. So perhaps my initial assumption about the product is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is not cyclohexanol.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, and product 4 is the alcohol, maybe it's a secondary alcohol instead of a primary. Hmm, but how?

Wait, another possibility: If product 3 is a chloroalkane, and product 4 is the corresponding alkane after reduction. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → vicinal dibromide (1,2-dibromocyclohexane).

2. Heated with NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene.

3. Cyclohexene + SOCl2 → maybe forms a chlorohydrin. Or perhaps adds across the double bond.

Wait, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a di chlorination.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, product 2 is cyclohexene. Then, treatment with SOCl2 could add across the double bond, forming a dichloride. For example, 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Step 4: treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → perhaps substitution of Cl with H.

But LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a hydride source, which typically substitutes halides. So product 4 would be 1,2-dihydrocyclohexane, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the Cls are replaced by Hs, giving cyclohexane.

But cyclohexane has all Hs equivalent, so only one type. But none of the options are 1.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step again, perhaps with a different mechanism.

Alternative approach:

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → forms a bromide via alpha bromination.

So product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 + NaOH → elimination forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, product 2 (cyclohexenone).

Step 3: product 2 + SOCl2 → forms an acid chloride (cyclohexenoyl chloride).

Step 4: product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol, cyclohexanol.

So product 4 is cyclohexanol.

As before, the number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol is 6, but the option A is 6. But wait, in the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are in different environments, leading to more than 6 distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to count the Hs again.

In cyclohexanol, the structure is such that each H is in a unique environment because of the substituent's position. For example:

- The H on C1 (equatorial) is unique.

- The axial H on C2 is unique.

- The equatorial H on C2 is unique.

- The axial H on C3 is unique.

- The equatorial H on C3 is unique.

- The axial H on C4 is unique.

Wait, no, C4 in cyclohexanol is opposite the OH. So in the chair conformation, the axial position of C4 is empty (since OH is axial on C1), and the equatorial positions have two Hs.

Wait, perhaps each H on C2, C3, C6, etc., is unique. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the number of distinct Hs based on the structure.

Another approach: Draw the structure of cyclohexanol and count the distinct Hs.

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group on one carbon. Each of the other five carbons has two Hs each.

In the chair conformation, the OH is axial. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have one axial and one equatorial H.

So, the Hs on C2 and C6 are as follows:

- C2 axial: unique.

- C2 equatorial: unique.

- C6 axial: unique.

- C6 equatorial: unique.

Wait, but due to the molecule's symmetry, the axial H on C2 is equivalent to the axial H on C6. Similarly, the equatorial H on C2 is equivalent to that on C6.

Wait, no, because C2 and C6 are in different positions relative to the substituent. So their Hs would be in different environments.

So, each axial H on C2 and C6 is unique, and each equatorial H is unique. That's four types from C2 and C6.

Then, C3 and C5:

Each has one axial and one equatorial H. Due to symmetry, the axial Hs on C3 and C5 are equivalent, and the equatorial Hs are equivalent. So that's two more types.

C4 has two equatorial Hs, which are equivalent. So that's one more type.

C1 has one equatorial H, which is unique.

So, adding them up:

C1: 1.

C2 axial: 1.

C2 equatorial: 1.

C3 axial: 1.

C3 equatorial: 1.

C4: 1.

C6 axial: 1.

C6 equatorial: 1.

Wait, but I'm already at 8, which is one of the options.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me recount.

No, perhaps each axial and equatorial H on C2 and C6 are unique, leading to 2 Hs per carbon × 2 carbons =4 H types.

Similarly, C3 and C5 contribute 2 H types each, but in reality, due to symmetry, C3 and C5 contribute 2 types in total (axial and equatorial).

C4 contributes 1 type.

C1 contributes 1 type.

So, 1 (C1) + 4 (C2 and C6 axial and equatorial) + 2 (C3 and C5 axial and equatorial) +1 (C4) = 8.

Ah, so the total would be 8 distinct Hs, which is option B.

So, the answer would be B)8.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions starting from cyclohexanone. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes alpha-bromination, where bromine adds to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). This forms **3-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**  
   Heating 3-bromocyclohexanone with NaOH leads to an elimination reaction. The bromine atom and a beta hydrogen are removed, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, **cyclohexenone** (3-en-1-one cyclohexane) as product 2.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexenone reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This converts the ketone group into an acid chloride, forming **cyclohexenoyl chloride** as product 3.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The product is **cyclohexanol**.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Cyclohexanol**  
   Cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with an -OH group attached to one carbon. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the -OH group and the opposite carbon. In the chair conformation, the -OH group is axial, and the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) have both axial and equatorial hydrogens. Due to the symmetry, the environments of the hydrogens are as follows:  
   - **C1**: 1 unique hydrogen (equatorial).  
   - **C2 and C6**: Each has 2 hydrogens (axial and equatorial), but due to symmetry, the axial hydrogens on C2 and C6 are equivalent, and the equatorial hydrogens on C2 and C6 are equivalent.  
   - **C3 and C5**: Each has 2 hydrogens (axial and equatorial), and due to symmetry, the axial hydrogens on C3 and C5 are equivalent, and the equatorial hydrogens on C3 and C5 are equivalent.  
   - **C4**: 2 equivalent equatorial hydrogens.  

   Adding these, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is **8**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem involves several reactions starting from cyclohexanone. I'll need to track each transformation to find out what the final product looks like, especially focusing on the number of distinct hydrogen atoms.

First, cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. I remember that bromine can add across double bonds in a dibromination reaction. But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone. Oh wait, no, the bromine addition is more likely in a different context. Wait, maybe it's an example of a halogenation reaction. Oh, wait, wait. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, and when you add bromine under certain conditions, it might undergo a bromohydrination. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? No, that's for dienes. Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a substitution reaction. No, bromine is typically for addition in alkenes. Wait, wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Hmm. Oh wait! I think when ketones like cyclohexanone react with bromine (Br2), it's an example of the haloform reaction. Wait, no, the haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone is treated with bromine in the presence of a base, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid and a haloform. But cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone. So that might not apply here.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is an addition. Oh, wait! Maybe I'm mixing things up. So cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Maybe the bromine adds to the carbonyl group. Wait, but the carbonyl is already a double bond between C=O. So adding Br2... Oh wait, no, it's more likely that the carbonyl is attacked, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination via a different mechanism. Hmm, maybe it's an example of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that's for alpha bromination of carboxylic acids, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromination via enol formation. Oh! That makes more sense. So in the presence of an acid, cyclohexanone can form an enol, and then bromine (Br2) would add across the conjugated double bond. So the first step is the addition of Br2 to the enol form of cyclohexanone. That would form a dibromide. Let me think: the enol would have a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, so adding Br2 would give a 1,2-dibromo derivative on those carbons.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: when cyclohexanone reacts with excess bromine, it could undergo a ring-opening. No, that's more for epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a benzilic acid rearrangement? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a diene.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. So cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Adding bromine could lead to the formation of a bromocyclohexanol, but that's more with other conditions like in the presence of a base. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is added to the carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a bromoketone. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a 1,2-diol.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about this again. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Adding Br2 under certain conditions might result in a bromohydrin. Wait, but bromohydrin formation is typically with aqueous Br2 and a base. Alternatively, if there's no water, maybe it's just adding Br across the carbonyl. Oh wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so adding Br2 would add across it. So in that case, cyclohexanone (which is a cyclic ketone with six-membered ring) would have the carbonyl group (O=C-) in the ring. Adding Br2 would add Br across the C=O, making O-C-Br and Br-C-O. Wait, but that can't happen because the carbonyl is a polar group. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a typical addition to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl (C=O) would react with Br2, but I'm not sure if that's a common reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). If those are brominated, that would add Br atoms there.

But under what conditions does that happen? The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction brominates alpha positions of carboxylic acids, but cyclohexanone is a ketone. Alternatively, using a Lewis acid catalyst like FeBr3 could cause bromination, but that's more for aromatic substitution. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone isn't aromatic. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the initial step is the formation of a bromocyclohexane through a radical mechanism. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromonium ion formation, but that's more for alkenes.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about what product 1 is. If the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, that would convert the ketone into a di bromide. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so adding Br2 would break the ring? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of a bromoketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm confusing this with another reaction. Another possibility is that when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, it undergoes a ring-opening. For example, in the case of epoxides, bromine can open the ring, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a simple addition of Br to the carbonyl, but I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by Br, but that would require a very strong condition, like HBr with a peroxide, but that's usually for alkenes.

Hmm, maybe the first reaction is a conjugate addition. Oh! Wait, cyclohexanone has a conjugated double bond system. So when bromine is added, it could undergo 1,4-addition. But I'm not sure about that because cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a carbonyl, so the conjugation is limited.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of cyclohexenone bromide. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next steps. Product 1 is treated with NaOH upon heating. So maybe product 1 is a dibromide. Then, heating with NaOH suggests a possible elimination reaction, like E2. So if product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, heating with NaOH would cause elimination, forming an alkene. That would make sense.

So, if product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, then product 2 would be an alkene.

Wait, but how did we get the dibromide from cyclohexanone? Oh! Perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl. Wait, but that would mean adding two Brs across the C=O bond, which would form a geminal dibromide. But let me think: cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone. Adding Br2 would add across the C=O, which would make O=CBr2, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps it's a bromide addition like in the case of ketones. Wait, maybe it's an example of the haloform reaction, but as I thought earlier, that requires a methyl ketone. So cyclohexanone is not a methyl ketone, so that's not possible.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm wrong about product 1. Let me consider another approach. Maybe the first step is the formation of a brominated cyclohexanol. So, adding HBr in a certain way. Wait, but that's more substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a di bromide through some other mechanism. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a bromination via the enol intermediate. So, when cyclohexanone is treated with aqueous HBr, it can form an enol which then adds Br, leading to a vicinal di bromide. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: So product 1 is treated with NaOH and heated to form product 2. If product 1 is a dibromide, then product 2 would be an alkene formed via elimination. For example, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, heating with NaOH would eliminate HBr and form cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring, so product 2 would be cyclohexene? No, wait, cyclohexene would be a ring with a double bond, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Wait, no, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then elimination would produce cyclohexene. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Wait, but then the next step is treatment with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, or alcohols to chlorides. So if product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene, what would happen when treated with SOCl2?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recap:

1. Cyclohexanone → treated with Br2 → product 1.
2. Product 1 heated with NaOH → product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → product 3.
4. Product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step.

Step 1: Reaction of cyclohexanone with Br2.

Another possibility: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine in a non-polar solvent, leading to the formation of a bromoketone. Wait, but how? Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of an alpha bromination. So, the alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl) would get brominated.

Wait, how does alpha bromination happen in ketones? I think in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, like FeBr3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's through a radical mechanism.

Wait, but without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a simple substitution. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group, which is a good electrophile. Maybe Br2 adds as a di electrophile, leading to a geminal dibromide. So product 1 would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane.

But wait, 1,1-dibromocyclohexane would have two Br atoms on the same carbon. Then, step two is heating with NaOH. That would likely lead to elimination, but with two Brs on the same carbon, elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, but the structure of cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with one carbonyl group. So when Br2 adds, perhaps forming a geminal dibromide, then elimination would form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but product 2 would then be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Because the elimination would form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, that might make more sense. So product 1 is a geminal dibromide, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Let me see: So cyclohexanone (with structure (CH2)5CO) → reacts with Br2 to form (CH2)5CBr2O. Then, heating with NaOH would cause elimination, removing H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone, where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

But wait, cyclohexenone would have a structure like (CH2)4C=CH-CO, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps the product 2 is actually a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. But I'm not entirely certain about this.

Moving on to step 3: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.

If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, treating with SOCl2 would typically convert any hydroxyl groups to chlorides. But in this case, product 2 is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that product 2 has an alcohol group, but that doesn't fit with the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene. Then, treating with SOCl2 could do what? Well, SOCl2 is used to convert alcohols to chlorides, but for alkenes, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a chlorination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an alkyl chloride. So if product 2 is an alkene, maybe there's a dienophile involved, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 2 is a diol, but I don't think so. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in step 1, product 1 is a vicinal di bromide, and in step 2, elimination forms an alkene, product 2.

So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, step 3 is treating with SOCl2. Hmm, I'm not sure what reaction would occur between an alkene and SOCl2. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has an alcohol group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the first reaction is the formation of a bromide at the alpha position.

Wait, let's assume that product 1 is alpha-bromo cyclohexanone. Then, step 2 is treating with NaOH, which could lead to elimination, forming an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, step 3 would be treating with SOCl2. If product 2 is an enone, then treating with SOCl2 might not do anything because there's no OH group. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted to an acid chloride, but that's not likely without an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an acid chloride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step again.

Let me try to approach this systematically.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Possible reactions for ketones with Br2:

1. Alpha bromination: introduces Br at the alpha position (CH2 adjacent to carbonyl). This could be via enol formation and then bromine addition. So product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone.

2. Addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group: unlikely because that would require breaking the C=O, which is possible but would form a geminal dibromide (O=CBr2), which is not a stable structure. I think this is not the case.

3. Another possibility: cyclohexanone could undergo a ring-opening with Br2 in an acidic environment, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I think the most plausible is alpha bromination. So product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: Product 1 (3-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with NaOH. This is likely an elimination reaction. The NaOH would deprotonate and abstract a proton beta to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So product 2 is cyclohexenone, specifically, 3-en-1-one cyclohexane, or something like that.

Step 3: Product 2 (the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine. What does SOCl2 do here? Typically, it converts carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but in this case, the compound is a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's converting an alcohol to a chloride, but product 2 is a ketone, not an alcohol. Wait, perhaps product 2 has an -OH group. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is 3-cyclohexenone, which is the same as cyclohex-1-en-3-one. Then, treating with SOCl2 and pyridine—what's that do? Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like condensation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is being converted into an acid chloride, but that would require an acid, which I don't think is present here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe product 3 is an acid chloride, but without an acid, that's not likely. Alternatively, if product 2 has an -OH group, but I don't see where that would come from.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps step 2 produces a diol. No, I don't think so because the elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about product 2. Let me re-examine step 2. If product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then heating with NaOH would cause elimination, removing two Brs and forming a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: treating cyclohexene with SOCl2. Hmm, I'm not sure what reaction would happen there. Maybe it's a diaddition? Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene doesn't react with SOCl2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a chlorination of the double bond, but I don't think that's a typical reaction.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene, and product 3 is the chlorohydrin. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a different reaction. Let's think: SOCl2 is used to convert alcohols to chlorides and ketones to acid chlorides, but under certain conditions. So if product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene, treating with SOCl2 might not do anything, but that doesn't fit with the steps leading to product 4.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the overall process.

The final step is treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent. But wait, no, actually, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is typically a milder reducing agent, used for specific reductions, like in the case of esters or other carbonyl groups, but it's known for being selective. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different hydride source.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 3 is an acid chloride because product 2 is a ketone, and SOCl2 converts it. But I'm not sure. Let me proceed with that assumption.

Assuming product 3 is an acid chloride (R-COCl), then treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would reduce the acid chloride to the corresponding alcohol. Wait, but LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent that reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols, but I'm not sure about the selective hydride agent. Alternatively, perhaps the hydride reduces the acid chloride to a ketone.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, then treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 (which is a bulky hydride agent) would likely reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. But wait, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is known for its ability to reduce esters and amides selectively, but I'm not certain about acid chlorides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone to alcohol reduction.

But if product 4 is an alcohol, then the structure would have an -OH group, and we need to count the distinct hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but let me try to retrace all steps with this assumption.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 3-bromocyclohexanone (product 1).

Step 2: 3-bromocyclohexanone, heated with NaOH → elimination forms cyclohexenone (product 2).

Step 3: cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → converts the ketone to an acid chloride, so product 3 is cyclohexenone chloride (R-COCl).

Step 4: product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. Wait, but LiAlH4 typically reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols, but I'm not sure if the bulky hydride would do the same. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone reduction.

Wait, but if product 3 is R-COCl, then LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. So the product would be R-CH2-OH, but wait, no. Wait, LiAlH4 reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols, but LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a weaker hydride source. Or is it a stronger one? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an aldehyde, but I don't see how that would happen.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's think of another possibility.

Wait, what if product 3 is a chloroalkane. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexene, and then treated with SOCl2, perhaps it adds across the double bond. Wait, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene reacts with SOCl2 in a Diels-Alder-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, if product 2 is an alkene, then treating with SOCl2 might not do much. That doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I should think about the entire process. So, the steps are:

1. Add Br2 to cyclohexanone → product 1.

2. Heat product 1 with NaOH → product 2.

3. Treat product 2 with SOCl2 and pyridine → product 3.

4. Treat product 3 with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Let me think about each step again, perhaps starting from the end.

The last step is treatment with a strong reducing agent. If product 3 is an ester or an acid chloride, then the hydride would reduce it. Alternatively, maybe product 3 is an acid, which would be reduced to a primary alcohol. But without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is:

- Cyclohexanone to an alcohol via several steps.

Let me try to think of each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → maybe bromohydrin formation. Wait, bromohydrin is the addition of Br and OH across the double bond. But cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait another approach: Maybe the reaction is a diels-alder, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a bromide substitution. Wait, but the starting material is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the overall product of these steps.

Suppose all steps are leading to cyclohexanol. Then, product 4 is cyclohexanol, which has six distinct H atoms (since it's a chair with axial and equatorial Hs, but in cyclohexanol, the OH is axial or equatorial, leading to different environments). Wait, no, cyclohexanol has multiple distinct Hs. Let me think: cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The Hs adjacent to the OH would be in different environments than the others. Let me count:

The OH is on a carbon. The adjacent carbons (two on each side) would each have two Hs, but in different environments. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has several unique Hs.

But perhaps I'm way off and should think again.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 3-bromocyclohexanone (alpha bromination).

2. 3-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexenone (3-en-1-one cyclohexane).

3. Cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → conversion to acid chloride. So cyclohexenone would become cyclohexenoyl chloride.

4. Cyclohexenoyl chloride + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduction to cyclohexanol.

Wait, does LiAlH(t-Bu)3 reduce acid chlorides? I think LiAlH4 does, but perhaps the bulky hydride would selectively reduce it. So if product 4 is cyclohexanol, how many distinct H's are there?

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with one OH group. Let me draw the structure. The OH is on carbon 1. Then, each of the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) have two Hs each. But in the ring, the Hs on C2 and C6 would be in equivalent environments if the ring is symmetric. Wait, no, if the ring is chair conformation, the axial and equatorial positions matter.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the symmetry. Let's imagine cyclohexanol in a chair conformation, with the OH in the axial position. Then, the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) would each have two Hs, but in different environments. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric, so some Hs are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has multiple equivalent Hs. Let me count:

- The OH is on C1. C1 has two Hs (assuming substitution; but in reality, cyclohexanol has C1 with two Hs and an OH).

Wait, no, in cyclohexanol, each carbon in the ring has two Hs except the one bearing the OH, which has one H and the OH. So in the ring, C1 has one H, C2 and C6 have two Hs each, and C3 and C5 have two Hs each, while C4 has two Hs.

Wait, but in terms of distinct Hs, the axial and equatorial positions can lead to different environments.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure. If the OH is axial, then the adjacent Hs (on C2 and C6) are axial and equatorial. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple distinct Hs due to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to imagine the structure and count the distinct Hs.

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The molecule is not symmetric because the OH is a substituent. So the positions are as follows:

- C1: OH group, one H.

- C2 and C6: each have two Hs, but their environments are different from each other and from C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the OH and the opposite carbon. So C2 and C6 are mirror images. Similarly, C3 and C5 are mirror images, and C4 is the same on both sides.

But for Hs, that would mean that Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent, as are those on C3 and C5. So, let's count:

- C1: 1 H (distinct).

- C2: two Hs, but since C2 and C6 are equivalent, their Hs are in the same environment. So two Hs, but they are the same as C6's two Hs. So that's one type.

- C3: two Hs, same as C5's, so another type.

- C4: two Hs, same on both sides.

Wait, but wait, the Hs on C2 and C6: Each C has two Hs. But in the chair conformation, are the axial and equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 in the same environment?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the number of distinct Hs in the molecule. In cyclohexanol, the Hs are as follows:

- The H on C1 is unique.

- The Hs on C2 (axial and equatorial) may be unique, but perhaps in the chair form, the axial H is in a different environment than the equatorial. Similarly for C6.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 6 distinct Hs. Or maybe 7.

Wait, another approach: The number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol. Each carbon in the ring has two Hs except C1. Let's think about the structure:

C1: OH, one H.

C2: two Hs, which are adjacent to the OH.

C3: two Hs, next to C2.

C4: two Hs, opposite the OH.

C5: two Hs, next to C4.

C6: two Hs, next to C5 and adjacent to C1.

Wait, but since the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the OH and C4, the Hs on C2 and C6 are mirror images. Similarly, C3 and C5 are mirror images. C4's Hs are symmetric.

So, the distinct Hs would be:

- C1: one H.

- C2 and C6: each have two Hs, but in the same environment as each other because of symmetry. So each C has two Hs, but they are equivalent between C2 and C6. So that's two types: one for the axial and one for the equatorial. Or perhaps not. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps all the Hs are in unique environments. Let me think. Each H is in a different position relative to the substituents. For example, the H on C1 is unique. The Hs on C2 adjacent to C1 are unique as well. The Hs on C3 are adjacent to C2, which is adjacent to C1, making them unique. Similarly, the Hs on C4 are opposite the OH, which is a different environment. So perhaps each H is unique.

But that would give a total of 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C4) + 2 (C5) + 2 (C6) → but that's 1 + (2*5) = 11, which can't be right because the options don't go that high.

Wait, I must be making a mistake. Let me think more carefully.

In cyclohexanol, the structure has a six-membered ring. The OH is at one position, say position 1. Then, each adjacent carbon (2 and 6) has two Hs each. But due to the ring's symmetry, the Hs on C2 and C6 are mirror images. So the Hs on C2 are equivalent to those on C6. Similarly, the Hs on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The Hs on C4 are in a symmetric position.

So, the distinct Hs would be:

- C1: 1 H (distinct).

- C2 and C6: each have two Hs, but in the same environment, so that's two types: axial and equatorial. Or perhaps each carbon's Hs are in a different environment.

Wait, no, in the chair conformation, each axial and equatorial H is in a different environment. So C2 has two axial Hs and two equatorial Hs, but in reality, each C has only two Hs. Let me get this straight.

Wait, each carbon in cyclohexane normally has two Hs. In cyclohexanol, the C1 has one H and an OH. The other Cs each have two Hs. But in the chair form, the axial and equatorial positions are different.

So, in cyclohexanol, the Hs on C2:

- The axial H is in a different environment than the equatorial H on the same C.

Similarly for C6, its axial H is in a different environment than its equatorial H. But due to symmetry, the axial H on C2 is the same as the axial H on C6? No, because they are on different positions relative to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on C2 axial and equatorial are unique, and likewise for C6. Similarly, the Hs on C3 and C5 are unique, and the Hs on C4 are unique.

But this is getting too detailed, and I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to count the distinct Hs based on the chair conformation.

In the chair conformation of cyclohexanol:

- C1 has an axial OH and one axial H, but wait, no. Wait, in the chair, the OH is axial, so the H on C1 is equatorial.

Wait, no, the chair has C1 with the OH in the axial position. So the H on C1 is in the equatorial position. Then, the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) have Hs in axial and equatorial positions.

So, for C2:

- One axial H.

- One equatorial H.

Same for C6.

For C3:

- One axial H.

- One equatorial H.

Same for C5.

For C4:

- Two equatorial Hs (since it's opposite the OH, so axial position is empty).

So, the distinct Hs would be:

- C1: 1 H (equatorial).

- C2 axial: 1 H.

- C2 equatorial: 1 H.

- C6 axial: same as C2 axial.

- C6 equatorial: same as C2 equatorial.

Wait, no, because C2 and C6 are adjacent to the OH, their axial and equatorial Hs would be in different environments. So, are the axial Hs on C2 and C6 the same? Or are they different?

No, because they are in different positions relative to the substituent. So, C2 axial and C6 axial are in different environments. Similarly, their equatorial Hs are different.

Wait, but that would lead to more distinct Hs than I can imagine.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent. For example, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4. So, the Hs on C2 axial and C6 axial are mirror images and thus equivalent. Similarly, the equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent.

But the Hs on C3 and C5 would also be mirror images. So:

- C1: 1 H (equatorial).

- C2 axial and C6 axial: same environment → 1 type.

- C2 equatorial and C6 equatorial: same environment → 1 type.

- C3 axial and C5 axial: same environment → 1 type.

- C3 equatorial and C5 equatorial: same environment → 1 type.

- C4: two equatorial Hs → same environment → 1 type.

So total distinct Hs: C1 (1) + C2 axial (1) + C2 equatorial (1) + C3 axial (1) + C3 equatorial (1) + C4 (1).

Wait, that's 6 distinct H types. But let me count:

1. C1 equatorial H.

2. C2 axial H.

3. C2 equatorial H.

4. C3 axial H.

5. C3 equatorial H.

6. C4 equatorial H.

Wait, that's 6. But wait, the options don't have 6 as the correct answer. Or do they? The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product might not be cyclohexanol. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps product 4 isn't cyclohexanol. Let me think again.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, and product 4 is the reduction product, which would be a primary alcohol. So, let's say product 3 is RCOCl, and product 4 is RCH2OH?

Wait, no, because the reduction of an acid chloride (RCOCl) with LiAlH4 (or a similar reagent) would give RCH2OH. Wait, no, LiAlH4 typically reduces RCOCl to RCH2OH? Or to RCH2Li? Wait, no, I think the reduction of an acid chloride with LiAlH4 gives a primary alcohol.

Wait, so if product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride (assuming that's the structure), then product 4 would be cyclohexanol. Then, as I thought earlier, the number of distinct Hs would be 6.

But wait, in cyclohexanol, the Hs on C2 and C6 are each in two environments (axial and equatorial), so each has two distinct Hs. So for C2: 2 Hs, but both are in different environments.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that due to symmetry, some of these Hs would be equivalent. So, perhaps the correct count is 7.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again about the structure of cyclohexanol.

In the chair conformation, the OH is axial. Each adjacent carbon (C2 and C6) has one axial and one equatorial H.

So, the Hs on C2:

- Axial H: pointing upwards.

- Equatorial H: pointing outwards.

Similarly for C6.

In this case, the axial Hs on C2 and C6 are in equivalent environments, so they'd be the same. Similarly, the equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent. So that's two types of Hs from C2 and C6.

Then, moving further down the ring, C3 and C5 each have axial and equatorial Hs. Are these equivalent? Because the ring is symmetric, the axial H on C3 is equivalent to the axial H on C5, and the equatorial H on C3 is equivalent to that on C5. So that's two more types.

C4 has two equatorial Hs, which are equivalent. So that's one more type.

C1 has one equatorial H.

So, the distinct Hs are:

1. C1 equatorial.

2. C2 and C6 axial.

3. C2 and C6 equatorial.

4. C3 and C5 axial.

5. C3 and C5 equatorial.

6. C4 equatorial.

That's 6 distinct types. But wait, another possibility: The axial H on C2 and C6 are in different environments because their positions relative to the substituent (OH) are different. So they might not be equivalent.

Wait, but considering the molecule's symmetry, the plane of symmetry passes through the OH and C4. So for C2 and C6, the axial H on C2 is on one side of the plane, and the axial H on C6 is on the other. Due to the plane of symmetry, these two axial Hs are mirror images and thus equivalent. Similarly, their equatorial Hs are also equivalent.

So, for C2 and C6:

- Axial Hs: same.

- Equatorial Hs: same.

Similarly, C3 and C5 have equivalent axial and equatorial Hs.

So, the distinct Hs are:

1. C1: 1.

2. C2 axial: 1.

3. C2 equatorial: 1.

4. C3 axial: 1.

5. C3 equatorial: 1.

6. C4: 1.

Total: 6.

But wait, the options include 7. So perhaps I missed one.

Wait, perhaps C4 has two distinct Hs. Because in the chair conformation, the two equatorial Hs on C4 are in different environments. No, wait, in the chair, each equatorial H is in a different position. Alternatively, maybe the two Hs on C4 are equivalent, as they're both equatorial and symmetric.

Hmm, but that would make C4 contribute one type. So 6 types in total.

But the options have 7. So perhaps my initial assumption about the product is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is not cyclohexanol.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, and product 4 is the alcohol, maybe it's a secondary alcohol instead of a primary. Hmm, but how?

Wait, another possibility: If product 3 is a chloroalkane, and product 4 is the corresponding alkane after reduction. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → vicinal dibromide (1,2-dibromocyclohexane).

2. Heated with NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene.

3. Cyclohexene + SOCl2 → maybe forms a chlorohydrin. Or perhaps adds across the double bond.

Wait, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a di chlorination.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, product 2 is cyclohexene. Then, treatment with SOCl2 could add across the double bond, forming a dichloride. For example, 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Step 4: treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → perhaps substitution of Cl with H.

But LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a hydride source, which typically substitutes halides. So product 4 would be 1,2-dihydrocyclohexane, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the Cls are replaced by Hs, giving cyclohexane.

But cyclohexane has all Hs equivalent, so only one type. But none of the options are 1.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step again, perhaps with a different mechanism.

Alternative approach:

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → forms a bromide via alpha bromination.

So product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 + NaOH → elimination forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, product 2 (cyclohexenone).

Step 3: product 2 + SOCl2 → forms an acid chloride (cyclohexenoyl chloride).

Step 4: product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol, cyclohexanol.

So product 4 is cyclohexanol.

As before, the number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol is 6, but the option A is 6. But wait, in the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are in different environments, leading to more than 6 distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to count the Hs again.

In cyclohexanol, the structure is such that each H is in a unique environment because of the substituent's position. For example:

- The H on C1 (equatorial) is unique.

- The axial H on C2 is unique.

- The equatorial H on C2 is unique.

- The axial H on C3 is unique.

- The equatorial H on C3 is unique.

- The axial H on C4 is unique.

Wait, no, C4 in cyclohexanol is opposite the OH. So in the chair conformation, the axial position of C4 is empty (since OH is axial on C1), and the equatorial positions have two Hs.

Wait, perhaps each H on C2, C3, C6, etc., is unique. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the number of distinct Hs based on the structure.

Another approach: Draw the structure of cyclohexanol and count the distinct Hs.

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group on one carbon. Each of the other five carbons has two Hs each.

In the chair conformation, the OH is axial. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have one axial and one equatorial H.

So, the Hs on C2 and C6 are as follows:

- C2 axial: unique.

- C2 equatorial: unique.

- C6 axial: unique.

- C6 equatorial: unique.

Wait, but due to the molecule's symmetry, the axial H on C2 is equivalent to the axial H on C6. Similarly, the equatorial H on C2 is equivalent to that on C6.

Wait, no, because C2 and C6 are in different positions relative to the substituent. So their Hs would be in different environments.

So, each axial H on C2 and C6 is unique, and each equatorial H is unique. That's four types from C2 and C6.

Then, C3 and C5:

Each has one axial and one equatorial H. Due to symmetry, the axial Hs on C3 and C5 are equivalent, and the equatorial Hs are equivalent. So that's two more types.

C4 has two equatorial Hs, which are equivalent. So that's one more type.

C1 has one equatorial H, which is unique.

So, adding them up:

C1: 1.

C2 axial: 1.

C2 equatorial: 1.

C3 axial: 1.

C3 equatorial: 1.

C4: 1.

C6 axial: 1.

C6 equatorial: 1.

Wait, but I'm already at 8, which is one of the options.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me recount.

No, perhaps each axial and equatorial H on C2 and C6 are unique, leading to 2 Hs per carbon × 2 carbons =4 H types.

Similarly, C3 and C5 contribute 2 H types each, but in reality, due to symmetry, C3 and C5 contribute 2 types in total (axial and equatorial).

C4 contributes 1 type.

C1 contributes 1 type.

So, 1 (C1) + 4 (C2 and C6 axial and equatorial) + 2 (C3 and C5 axial and equatorial) +1 (C4) = 8.

Ah, so the total would be 8 distinct Hs, which is option B.

So, the answer would be B)8.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions starting from cyclohexanone. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes alpha-bromination, where bromine adds to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). This forms **3-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**  
   Heating 3-bromocyclohexanone with NaOH leads to an elimination reaction. The bromine atom and a beta hydrogen are removed, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, **cyclohexenone** (3-en-1-one cyclohexane) as product 2.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexenone reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This converts the ketone group into an acid chloride, forming **cyclohexenoyl chloride** as product 3.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The product is **cyclohexanol**.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Cyclohexanol**  
   Cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with an -OH group attached to one carbon. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the -OH group and the opposite carbon. In the chair conformation, the -OH group is axial, and the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) have both axial and equatorial hydrogens. Due to the symmetry, the environments of the hydrogens are as follows:  
   - **C1**: 1 unique hydrogen (equatorial).  
   - **C2 and C6**: Each has 2 hydrogens (axial and equatorial), but due to symmetry, the axial hydrogens on C2 and C6 are equivalent, and the equatorial hydrogens on C2 and C6 are equivalent.  
   - **C3 and C5**: Each has 2 hydrogens (axial and equatorial), and due to symmetry, the axial hydrogens on C3 and C5 are equivalent, and the equatorial hydrogens on C3 and C5 are equivalent.  
   - **C4**: 2 equivalent equatorial hydrogens.  

   Adding these, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is **8**.

**Answer: B**
