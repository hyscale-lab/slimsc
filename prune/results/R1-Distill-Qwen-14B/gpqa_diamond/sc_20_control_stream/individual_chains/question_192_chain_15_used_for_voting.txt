Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, let me read the problem again.

We have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, I imagine a diagram here: the conductor with the cavity off-center, and point P somewhere outside, not aligned directly with the centers.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields. I think the key here is to consider how the charges are induced and how they affect the electric field outside.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged initially. So, when we place a positive charge q inside the cavity, the conductor itself remains neutral. But the presence of q should cause charges to redistribute on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Right, because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So, any excess charges would arrange themselves on the surfaces. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must develop a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to q. Because the charge inside the cavity is +q, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. Placing a charge +q inside the cavity will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have -q, and the outer surface to have +q, so that the total charge on the conductor remains zero. Because the outer surface has +q, any field outside the conductor would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the cavity is off-center. So, the inner surface is induced with -q, but the position of the charge affects the distribution. However, for points outside the conductor, the electric field should only depend on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, right? Because of Gauss's Law.

Let me think about Gauss's Law. The electric flux through a Gaussian surface depends on the enclosed charge. So, for a point outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor and the charge inside the cavity. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the total enclosed charge is q (from the cavity) plus the charges on the conductor. Wait, the conductor has inner surface -q and outer +q, so the net is zero. So the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the conductor would just be q. Because the cavity's charge is inside the conductor's Gaussian surface.

Wait no, wait. The conductor is a shell. The charge in the cavity is inside the conductor's material. So, the conductor's outer surface has +q because the inner surface is -q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the charge enclosed would be the sum of the charges inside the conductor's Gaussian surface. But the conductor itself is neutral, so the net charge is zero. Wait, no, the total charge of the conductor is zero, but the charge in the cavity is +q. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, outer has +q. So the total charge inside any Gaussian surface outside the conductor would be the charge of the conductor's outer surface, which is +q. Because the charge in the cavity is enclosed by the conductor, but it's surrounded by the inner surface's -q. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let's clarify. The conductor is neutral. So, when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. To maintain neutrality, the outer surface must have +q. So, when you're outside the conductor, the total enclosed charge is +q (since the conductor's outer surface has +q). Therefore, the electric field outside should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this setup, the charge is inside an off-center cavity. Does that affect the field outside? Because from outside, the conductor behaves as if all its charge is at the center, regardless of the internal distribution. So the field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor. But wait, in this case, the conductor's charge is zero, so the charge outside would be +q from the cavity's influence.

Wait, no. The conductor's net charge is zero. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q. So, the total charge enclosed within the conductor's Gaussian surface is zero. So when you draw a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge is the charge of the conductor plus any charge inside it. The conductor's charge is zero, but the charge inside the conductor (the cavity's charge) is +q. So the total enclosed charge is +q. So, the electric field outside should be as if a charge +q is at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity.

Wait, but in this problem, the point P is located outside the conductor but its position is determined by l, the distance from the cavity's center, and L from the conductor's center. So, how does that affect the field?

Wait, maybe the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the internal fields but not the external. Because, as per the shielding effect, the charges on the conductor's inner surface would redistribute to cancel the field inside the conductor. So, the external field would depend only on the conductor's outer surface charge, which is +q, located at the center of the conductor.

So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), which matches this reasoning.

Wait, but wait, what about the configuration of the cavity? Since the cavity is off-center, does the electric field at point P change? Because the charge is not at the center of the conductor. Hmm. Let me think again.

Ah, but the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the inner surface are induced such that the field inside the conductor is zero. The outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform if the conductor is neutral, but in this case, the outer surface has +q. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface would have +q, so the distribution would depend on the shape. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface is a sphere, so the charge distribution is uniform. So the external field would be the same as a point charge at the center.

In other words, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed (as long as it's inside, not touching the conductor), the external field at a distance L from the center is E = k q / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀).

So, looking at the options again, option B matches this. The other options involve l and the angle theta, which would come into play if the point P were inside the conductor or in the cavity, but not outside.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's entire charge (+q) contributes to the field. But for a conductor, regardless of the internal charge distribution, the external field is as if all the charge is at the center. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

Wait, but some options have (l + s cosθ) squared or something similar. Why would l be involved if we're considering the entire conductor's charge? Because when the conductor is a sphere, any point outside is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the field at point P would depend on L, not l, because point P is outside, and the conductor's charge is as a point at its center.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation using the properties of conductors and Gauss's Law. The conductor is initially uncharged, but a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor. To maintain neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$.

For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Since the conductor is neutral, the total charge enclosed is $+q$, which resides on the outer surface of the conductor. By the shielding effect, the external field behaves as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor, regardless of the internal charge distribution.

The distance of point $P$ from the center of the conductor is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options involve $l$, $\theta$, or combinations of these variables, which are irrelevant for points outside the conductor. The external field depends only on $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$.

Answer: B
