Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, let's break this down. A di-substituted benzene ring means there are two substituents on the ring. The molecule has 6 carbons in the aromatic ring, plus 2 more substituents, making 8 carbons total. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, but the substituents add more. So if the molecule has 8 carbons in total, the substituents must contribute 2 carbons. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So each substituent is a single group with one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Because the IR has both a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen (like Cl or Br).

Wait, but wait, carbonyl groups could be in a ketone, aldehyde, etc. So let's think about the structure.

So the ring is benzene, substituted with two groups: one is a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone or aldehyde or something), and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's say one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. But wait, the carbonyl group could also be part of a substituent that's more than just a single atom. For example, maybe an acyl group attached as a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester or another structure.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So benzene (6 C) + substituents. So substituents must add 2 C. Each substituent could be a single carbon, or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe each substituent is a single carbon group.

Wait, let me think. If the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a carbonyl attached to two R groups) and a halogen.

But a halogen is just one atom, so the substituent is, say, a Cl attached to the ring. So that substituent is one Cl atom, but it doesn't add any carbons. So the carbonyl group must be part of a substituent that contributes a carbon. Like a acyl group, maybe. Wait, but then the substituent would be a carbonyl plus adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen, but the carbonyl is part of a larger group.

Wait, but the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents have 2 carbons. So maybe the two substituents are: one is a carbonyl group (like ketone, which is just a single carbon attached to O), and the other is a halogen (which doesn't add any carbons). Wait, but that would give 6 + 1 =7 carbons. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group with a methyl group attached. For example, a ketone substituent, like a propanone group? Or maybe an acetyl group.

Wait, let's think. If one substituent is an acetyl group (CH3CO-), that's 2 carbons. Then the other substituent would be a halogen, like Cl. That would give 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 1 (Cl) =9 carbons. But the question says the compound has 8 carbons. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, wait. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group that doesn't add any extra carbons beyond the ring. Like, if the substituent is a formyl group (CHO), which is a single carbon. Then the ring (6) + CHO (1) + another substituent, which if it's a halogen, adds 0 carbons. That gives total 7, but the question says 8. So that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to something else. Like, perhaps, the substituent is a carbonyl group and another substituent is a methyl group. But wait, then the IR would detect a carbonyl and a methyl, but the question says the IR also has an aromatic-halogen bond. So maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen (like Cl or Br). Let's think: the substituent with the carbonyl is, say, an acetyl group (CH3CO-), which is two carbons, and the other substituent is Cl. So 6 + 2 + 0 =8? No, because Cl doesn't add any carbons. So 6+2=8. No, that would make 8. Wait, the ring is 6, substituents are two groups: one is acetyl (2 C), the other is Cl (0 C). So 6 +2=8. That works.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are attached to the ring. So the substituents are acetyl (–COCH3) and Cl. So the ring has two substituents: COCH3 and Cl. But wait, how many carbons does that contribute? The COCH3 is two carbons (the CO is from the ring, the CH3 is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl). So the substituent has two carbons. Cl is none. So total carbons in compound: 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) =8. Yes, that fits.

So the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents Cl and COCH3. The substituents can be in positions like para, meta, or ortho.

But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me think. The substituents could be a carbonyl group and another group that contributes a carbon. For example, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone, which is just the carbonyl attached to the ring) and another substituent that's a methyl group. But then the IR would not show a halogen. Oh, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and a halogen, so in that case, the substituents must be carbonyl and halogen.

So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups.

Now, let's think about their positions. Benzene with two substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. The NMR spectrum will depend on the positions because the splitting patterns will vary.

In the case of para-substituted benzene with two strong activating groups (like Cl is ortho/para directing, and COCH3 is also ortho/para directing), the substituents would typically be in the para positions.

But wait, the NMR data in the options might help us figure this out.

Now, looking at the options, each has different NMR signals.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Hmm, a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's very deshielded. Could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl. An aldehyde has a strong C=O and the aldehyde proton. But in the structure we're considering, we have COCH3, which is a ketone, not an aldehyde. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet or a singlet? Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. If the structure has an aldehyde, that would change the substituents.

Wait, but our substituents were COCH3 and Cl. So no aldehyde. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
These look like two doublets around 4.8 and 4.6, and a singlet at 1.3. That might suggest something like a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. Maybe an AB system. But wait, for a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps this is a vinyl group or something else. But I'm not sure. Maybe an acetylene? Or perhaps it's a substituent that's an ether, like OCH2CH2O or something, but that's not matching the substituent types.

Hmm, but in our case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. COCH3 would have a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. So the CH3 would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm typically. But in option B, the 1.3 is a singlet, and there's nothing in that region for a CH3 from a ketone. So maybe option B isn't the right one.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
The aromatic region has two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps. The 2.3 ppm singlet is a good sign for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like COCH3. So this looks promising.

So for option C: the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a 1,4-disubstitution on the benzene ring. So the substituents are in para positions.

If the substituents are COCH3 and Cl, then the aromatic protons would be the ones adjacent to the substituents. Let me imagine:

Structure: benzene ring with COCH3 at position 1 and Cl at position 4 (para). Then the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons: the ones ortho to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) and the ones ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each would be a doublet because each proton is adjacent to one substituent.

Wait, but the substituents are in para positions. So the ring would have four equivalent aromatic protons? Or are they split into two sets?

Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other. The protons ortho to each substituent would be equivalent, and the protons meta to the substituents would be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two sets of doublets.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring has two sets of doublets. For example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to A) are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 (meta to A, ortho to B) are another set. So two doublets.

In the case of substituent A being a strong deactivating group (like Cl, which is electron-withdrawing) and substituent B being an electron-withdrawing group (like COCH3), the ring's aromatic protons would have specific shifts.

The ortho protons to COCH3 would be deshielded and appear downfield. Similarly, the ortho protons to Cl would also be deshielded but maybe less so than those next to the ketone.

So in the NMR, the two doublets would be around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. The higher field (7.6) could be due to the Cl's ortho protons, while the more downfield (7.8) due to the ketone's ortho protons.

The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group from COCH3, which makes sense.

So option C looks correct. Let me check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)
The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but why only 1H? It suggests that maybe there's a substituent causing asymmetry, like a meta substitution. But our substituents are in para positions, so all the aromatic protons would be in pairs, not singlet. So this option doesn't fit.

So option C seems to match. Let me make sure.

IR has peaks for carbonyl (C=O) and aromatic-halogen. So in the structure, COCH3 gives the carbonyl, and Cl gives the halogen bond.

So in the NMR, the COCH3 would show as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm. The aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating 2H. So option C matches this.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl). The total number of carbons is 8: 6 from the benzene ring, 2 from the COCH₃ group, and 0 from the halogen.

The NMR spectrum must reflect this structure. The COCH₃ group contributes a methyl group (CH₃) that appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. The aromatic protons are split into two sets of doublets due to the para-substitution pattern, with the protons ortho to the carbonyl group appearing more downfield (higher chemical shift) than those ortho to the halogen.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the COCH₃ group (a ketone, not an aldehyde). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest an AB system, which does not match the expected aromatic and methyl signals for the structure. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of COCH₃. This option matches the expected NMR data.
- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with COCH₃ and Cl as substituents.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, let's break this down. A di-substituted benzene ring means there are two substituents on the ring. The molecule has 6 carbons in the aromatic ring, plus 2 more substituents, making 8 carbons total. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, but the substituents add more. So if the molecule has 8 carbons in total, the substituents must contribute 2 carbons. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So each substituent is a single group with one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Because the IR has both a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen (like Cl or Br).

Wait, but wait, carbonyl groups could be in a ketone, aldehyde, etc. So let's think about the structure.

So the ring is benzene, substituted with two groups: one is a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone or aldehyde or something), and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's say one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. But wait, the carbonyl group could also be part of a substituent that's more than just a single atom. For example, maybe an acyl group attached as a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester or another structure.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So benzene (6 C) + substituents. So substituents must add 2 C. Each substituent could be a single carbon, or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe each substituent is a single carbon group.

Wait, let me think. If the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a carbonyl attached to two R groups) and a halogen.

But a halogen is just one atom, so the substituent is, say, a Cl attached to the ring. So that substituent is one Cl atom, but it doesn't add any carbons. So the carbonyl group must be part of a substituent that contributes a carbon. Like a acyl group, maybe. Wait, but then the substituent would be a carbonyl plus adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen, but the carbonyl is part of a larger group.

Wait, but the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents have 2 carbons. So maybe the two substituents are: one is a carbonyl group (like ketone, which is just a single carbon attached to O), and the other is a halogen (which doesn't add any carbons). Wait, but that would give 6 + 1 =7 carbons. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group with a methyl group attached. For example, a ketone substituent, like a propanone group? Or maybe an acetyl group.

Wait, let's think. If one substituent is an acetyl group (CH3CO-), that's 2 carbons. Then the other substituent would be a halogen, like Cl. That would give 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 1 (Cl) =9 carbons. But the question says the compound has 8 carbons. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, wait. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group that doesn't add any extra carbons beyond the ring. Like, if the substituent is a formyl group (CHO), which is a single carbon. Then the ring (6) + CHO (1) + another substituent, which if it's a halogen, adds 0 carbons. That gives total 7, but the question says 8. So that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to something else. Like, perhaps, the substituent is a carbonyl group and another substituent is a methyl group. But wait, then the IR would detect a carbonyl and a methyl, but the question says the IR also has an aromatic-halogen bond. So maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen (like Cl or Br). Let's think: the substituent with the carbonyl is, say, an acetyl group (CH3CO-), which is two carbons, and the other substituent is Cl. So 6 + 2 + 0 =8? No, because Cl doesn't add any carbons. So 6+2=8. No, that would make 8. Wait, the ring is 6, substituents are two groups: one is acetyl (2 C), the other is Cl (0 C). So 6 +2=8. That works.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are attached to the ring. So the substituents are acetyl (–COCH3) and Cl. So the ring has two substituents: COCH3 and Cl. But wait, how many carbons does that contribute? The COCH3 is two carbons (the CO is from the ring, the CH3 is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl). So the substituent has two carbons. Cl is none. So total carbons in compound: 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) =8. Yes, that fits.

So the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents Cl and COCH3. The substituents can be in positions like para, meta, or ortho.

But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me think. The substituents could be a carbonyl group and another group that contributes a carbon. For example, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone, which is just the carbonyl attached to the ring) and another substituent that's a methyl group. But then the IR would not show a halogen. Oh, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and a halogen, so in that case, the substituents must be carbonyl and halogen.

So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups.

Now, let's think about their positions. Benzene with two substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. The NMR spectrum will depend on the positions because the splitting patterns will vary.

In the case of para-substituted benzene with two strong activating groups (like Cl is ortho/para directing, and COCH3 is also ortho/para directing), the substituents would typically be in the para positions.

But wait, the NMR data in the options might help us figure this out.

Now, looking at the options, each has different NMR signals.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Hmm, a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's very deshielded. Could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl. An aldehyde has a strong C=O and the aldehyde proton. But in the structure we're considering, we have COCH3, which is a ketone, not an aldehyde. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet or a singlet? Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. If the structure has an aldehyde, that would change the substituents.

Wait, but our substituents were COCH3 and Cl. So no aldehyde. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
These look like two doublets around 4.8 and 4.6, and a singlet at 1.3. That might suggest something like a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. Maybe an AB system. But wait, for a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps this is a vinyl group or something else. But I'm not sure. Maybe an acetylene? Or perhaps it's a substituent that's an ether, like OCH2CH2O or something, but that's not matching the substituent types.

Hmm, but in our case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. COCH3 would have a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. So the CH3 would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm typically. But in option B, the 1.3 is a singlet, and there's nothing in that region for a CH3 from a ketone. So maybe option B isn't the right one.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
The aromatic region has two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps. The 2.3 ppm singlet is a good sign for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like COCH3. So this looks promising.

So for option C: the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a 1,4-disubstitution on the benzene ring. So the substituents are in para positions.

If the substituents are COCH3 and Cl, then the aromatic protons would be the ones adjacent to the substituents. Let me imagine:

Structure: benzene ring with COCH3 at position 1 and Cl at position 4 (para). Then the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons: the ones ortho to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) and the ones ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each would be a doublet because each proton is adjacent to one substituent.

Wait, but the substituents are in para positions. So the ring would have four equivalent aromatic protons? Or are they split into two sets?

Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other. The protons ortho to each substituent would be equivalent, and the protons meta to the substituents would be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two sets of doublets.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring has two sets of doublets. For example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to A) are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 (meta to A, ortho to B) are another set. So two doublets.

In the case of substituent A being a strong deactivating group (like Cl, which is electron-withdrawing) and substituent B being an electron-withdrawing group (like COCH3), the ring's aromatic protons would have specific shifts.

The ortho protons to COCH3 would be deshielded and appear downfield. Similarly, the ortho protons to Cl would also be deshielded but maybe less so than those next to the ketone.

So in the NMR, the two doublets would be around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. The higher field (7.6) could be due to the Cl's ortho protons, while the more downfield (7.8) due to the ketone's ortho protons.

The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group from COCH3, which makes sense.

So option C looks correct. Let me check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)
The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but why only 1H? It suggests that maybe there's a substituent causing asymmetry, like a meta substitution. But our substituents are in para positions, so all the aromatic protons would be in pairs, not singlet. So this option doesn't fit.

So option C seems to match. Let me make sure.

IR has peaks for carbonyl (C=O) and aromatic-halogen. So in the structure, COCH3 gives the carbonyl, and Cl gives the halogen bond.

So in the NMR, the COCH3 would show as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm. The aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating 2H. So option C matches this.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl). The total number of carbons is 8: 6 from the benzene ring, 2 from the COCH₃ group, and 0 from the halogen.

The NMR spectrum must reflect this structure. The COCH₃ group contributes a methyl group (CH₃) that appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. The aromatic protons are split into two sets of doublets due to the para-substitution pattern, with the protons ortho to the carbonyl group appearing more downfield (higher chemical shift) than those ortho to the halogen.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the COCH₃ group (a ketone, not an aldehyde). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest an AB system, which does not match the expected aromatic and methyl signals for the structure. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of COCH₃. This option matches the expected NMR data.
- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with COCH₃ and Cl as substituents.

Answer: C
