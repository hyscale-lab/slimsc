Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me take it step by step. The question is about naming a benzene ring with several substituents, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name from the given options.

First, I'll try to visualize the benzene ring. The benzene has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. These three are all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means they are separated by two carbons. So, if I imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon, each substituent is two positions away from the others.

Wait, no, wait. Meta is when substituents are on positions 1, 3, and 5 of the ring. But in this case, all three are meta to one another. That probably means they form a triangle on the ring. But I'm not sure about thatâ€”maybe each is two carbons apart from the others.

Wait, another thought: the problem says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other. So, each of them is meta to the others. So, for example, if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then the aldehyde is in position 3, and the cyano is in position 5. But wait, that's the same as each being in a meta position relative to each other because they are spaced two positions apart. So, that's how they're arranged.

Now, the problem goes on. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. Wait, ortho is the adjacent positions, so if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, positions 2 and 6 have a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) group.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is the position across the ring. So if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the para position is 4. So, position 4 has the methoxy group (-OCH3).

Also, the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is the cyano group, right? So, the cyano group is in position 5 (if I followed the earlier arrangement). So, the substituents ortho to cyano (position 5) would be positions 4 and 6. Wait, position 4 is the methoxy and position 6 is the dimethylamino. But in the problem statement, it says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. But earlier I thought that the hydroxyl is at position 2.

Wait, maybe I got the positions wrong. Let me try to map this out again.

Let me assign positions 1 through 6 in a benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Then, since the carboxylic acid is meta to both the aldehyde and the cyano group, the aldehyde would be in position 3, and the cyano in position 5. Wait, or maybe the aldehyde is in position 5 and the cyano in position 3? Hmm, but the main substituent is the carboxylic acid, so that's going to be the principal functional group, and its position will be the numbering starting point.

Wait, when numbering substituents on a benzene ring, the numbering starts at the principal functional group. Since this is a benzoic acid (because it has a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring), the principal group is the carboxylic acid. The numbering starts at the carboxylic acid as position 1.

So, substituting positions based on that:

- Position 1: -COOH (carboxylic acid)
- Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde)
- Position 5: -CN (cyano)

Now, the substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. According to the problem, these are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2). So, positions 2 and 6 have these groups.

Wait, but which is which? Position 2 and 6. The problem doesn't specify, but looking at the options, I might need to figure that out.

Additionally, the para position to the carboxylic acid is position 4. So, position 4 has the methoxy group (-OCH3).

Now, about the nitrile group in position 5. The problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. So, the substituents on positions 4 and 6 are ortho to the cyano (position 5). Because position 5 is attached to the cyano group, the ortho positions would be 4 and 6. So, position 4 is methoxy, position 6 is dimethylamino. Wait, but then the hydroxyl is in position 2, and the dimethylamino is in position 6.

Wait, but dimethylamino is in position 6, which is ortho to the carboxylic acid in position 1. So, that fits the initial condition: ortho to the acid are hydroxyl (position 2) and dimethylamino (position 6). And position 4 is methoxy, which is para to the acid.

Now, the nitrile is in position 5. The substituents ortho to it are positions 4 and 6. So, position 4 is methoxy and position 6 is dimethylamino. But the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the alcohol is in position 2, which is not adjacent to position 5. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I got the positions wrong. Let me try again. Let's see:

If the substituents meta to each other are the carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano, their positions should be 1,3,5. So, position 1 is COOH, 3 is CHO, 5 is CN.

Ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. These are occupied by -OH and N(CH3)2. Let's say, position 2 is -OH and 6 is N(CH3)2.

The para position to COOH is position 4, which is OCH3.

Now, the nitrile is in position 5. The substituents ortho to it are positions 4 and 6. So position 4 is OCH3, and position 6 is N(CH3)2.

So the problem statement says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. But the alcohol is in position 2, which is meta to position 5. Therefore, position 2 isn't ortho to 5. That's a problem. So maybe my initial assumption about the positions is wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps the aldehyde is in position 3, the cyano in position 5, and the carboxylic acid in position 1. Then, the substituents ortho to the acid (1) are 2 and 6: -OH and N(CH3)2.

The methoxy is in position 4, para to 1. Now, the nitrile is in 5. So the substituents ortho to 5 are positions 4 and 6. So position 4 is OCH3 and position 6 is N(CH3)2. But the problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. The alcohol is in position 2, which is not ortho to position 5. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. There's a contradiction here.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is in position 5, and the cyano in position 3. Let me try that. So position 1: COOH, position 3: CN, position 5: CHO.

Then, the substituents ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6: -OH and N(CH3)2.

Para to COOH is position 4: OCH3.

Now, the nitrile is in position 3. The substituents ortho to it are 2 and 4. So, position 2 is -OH and position 4 is OCH3. That makes sense because both are ortho to position 3 (CN). So the problem statement says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. So that's correct.

So now, let me list all substituents:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: -OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: N(CH3)2

Wait, no, because the substituent in position 6 is N(CH3)2, which is ortho to COOH (position 1).

But position 6 is also ortho to nitrile (position 3)? No, position 3's ortho positions are 2 and 4. So position 6 is meta to the nitrile. So that doesn't fit the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look at the positions again.

If the nitrile is in position 3, its ortho positions are 2 and 4.

So, the substituents in those positions are -OH (position 2) and OCH3 (position 4). So both are ortho to CN. That's correct.

So, the substituents in position 6 is N(CH3)2, which is ortho to COOH (position 1) but not ortho to CN (position 3). So that's okay because the problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to CN, which they are.

So now, substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

Wait, wait a second. Where's the aldehyde group? The problem states that the carbaldehyde is meta to the carboxylic acid and meta to the cyano. So, if the carboxylic acid is in 1, and CN in 3, then the aldehyde should be in 5. So, position 5 is CHO.

So, substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

Now, the IUPAC name.

The principal group is the carboxylic acid, so the suffix is -oic acid. The numbering starts at the COOH group as position 1. So the longest chain is the benzene ring, which is numbered accordingly.

Now, the substituents are:

Position 2: OH (hydroxyl)

Position 3: CN (cyano)

Position 4: OCH3 (methoxy)

Position 5: CHO (carbaldehyde, formyl)

Position 6: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but when naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except for the principal functional group.

Wait, the order of substituents is based on their position numbers, but in the name, they are arranged alphabetically, with the exception that the principal suffix comes first.

Wait no, the substituents are listed in order of their positions, but the name lists them in alphabetical order except for the principal group.

Wait, no, wait. In IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. But the numbering is determined based on the substituents to give the lowest possible numbers.

But wait, in this case, the principal group is the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to that.

So, the substituents are:

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

Now, the substituents are:

At position 2: -OH => hydroxyl

Position 3: -CN => cyano

Position 4: -OCH3 => methoxy

Position 5: -CHO => formyl

Position 6: -N(CH3)2 => dimethylamino

So, the substituents, when naming, are listed in alphabetical order. Let's list them:

Cyano (CN) comes first alphabetically.

Then dimethylamino (comes after C?), no, wait, alphabetical order is based on the substituent's prefix. Let me list all substituents:

- hydroxyl (OH)
- cyano (CN)
- methoxy (OCH3)
- formyl (CHO)
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Wait, the substituents are:

1. -CN (cyano)
2. -CHO (formyl)
3. -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
4. -OCH3 (methoxy)
5. -OH (hydroxyl)

Wait, but when arranging alphabetically, we look at the substituent's prefix. Let's see:

The substituents are:

- Cyano (CN)

- Formyl (CHO)

- Hydroxyl (OH)

- Methoxy (OCH3)

- Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name. Let's list the substituents in order:

1. Cyano (CN)

2. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

3. Formyl (CHO)

4. Hydroxyl (OH)

5. Methoxy (OCH3)

Wait, no, their order is based on the first letter of the substituent's name. So, C, D, F, H, M.

Wait, the substituent names are:

- Cyanide (CN)

Wait, no, the substituent is the cyano group, which is named as cyano.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order are:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

So the order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

But wait, the substituent at each position is:

Position 2: OH â†’ hydroxyl

Position 3: CN â†’ cyano

Position 4: OCH3 â†’ methoxy

Position 5: CHO â†’ formyl

Position 6: N(CH3)2 â†’ dimethylamino

So, substituents and their positions:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

So, the order in the name would be:

Benzoic acid is the main group. The substituents are listed as follows: cyano at position 3, then dimethylamino at position 6, formyl at position 5, hydroxyl at position 2, methoxy at position 4.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are in the order of their positions, but in the name, they are listed alphabetically, regardless of their position. So the order in the name would be:

Cyano (C), Dimethylamino (D), Formyl (F), Hydroxyl (H), Methoxy (M).

But in the correct name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so the order in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the substituents are in positions 2,3,4,5,6. So the numbering is 1 (COOH), then 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CHO), 6 (N(CH3)2).

So when writing the name, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not based on their positions. So the order would be:

C (cyano) comes first. Then D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

So the substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but in the options, looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

But wait, the substituent positions are 2,3,4,5,6. So in the name, they are listed in the order of their substituent names. So:

First comes the substituent with the earliest position number, but no, wait, the IUPAC name lists substituents in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name, not in the order of their positions.

So the order is:

1. Cyano (position 3)

2. Dimethylamino (position 6)

3. Formyl (position 5)

4. Hydroxyl (position 2)

5. Methoxy (position 4)

Wait, but when you list them alphabetically, the order is:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

So the substituents are listed as:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Putting it all together, the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. That's exactly what I have.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Option B's substituents are in the order hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6). But the problem is that when substituents are listed alphabetically, the order is as in option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the substituents in the name.

Wait, the substituents in the name are listed in alphabetical order of their names, but their numbering is based on their positions.

So the name would be:

benzoic acid with substituents at positions 2 (hydroxy), 3 (cyano), 4 (methoxy), 5 (formyl), 6 (dimethylamino).

But when written, the substituents are in the order of their alphabetical names:

C comes first (cyano at 3), then D (dimethylamino at 6), then F (formyl at 5), then H (hydroxy at 2), then M (methoxy at 4).

Wait, that can't be correct because the substituents are at 2,3,4,5,6, but the order in the name is based on the substituent's name, not their position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are listed in the order of their positions when the starting point is the principal group.

No, no. The correct approach is:

The principal group is the benzoic acid. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions, but each is numbered based on their position.

So the substituent order in the name will be:

Cyano (C), Dimethylamino (D), Formyl (F), Hydroxy (H), Methoxy (M).

So the substituents are:

3-cyano,

6-(dimethylamino),

5-formyl,

2-hydroxy,

4-methoxy.

So the name is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

But let me look at the options again.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, the correct order is option A, right? Because the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So cyano comes first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy.

So the substituents in the name are 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

So the correct option is A.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in the name, substituents are listed in the order of their positions, but no, I think IUPAC requires substituents to be in alphabetical order. Let me confirm.

Yes, in IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except when the substituent's position is lower when listed in numerical order. Wait, no, actually, substituents are listed in alphabetical order regardless of their position numbers. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible set of numbers, but once the numbering is fixed, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order of their names, not position.

So the substituents are listed in the name as:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait, but looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

In option B, the substituents are in the order: hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino. But that's not the correct alphabetical order. Because C comes before D, F, H, M. So cyano should come first. Therefore, option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with multiple substituents. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all meta to each other. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group, and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy (-OCH3) group. The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are also ortho to the cyano group.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Positioning of Substituents**:
   - The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is at position 1 (the principal functional group).
   - The carbaldehyde (-CHO) is at position 3 (meta to -COOH).
   - The cyano group (-CN) is at position 5 (meta to -COOH and -CHO).
   - Ortho to -COOH (positions 2 and 6) are -OH (position 2) and -N(CH3)2 (position 6).
   - Para to -COOH (position 4) is -OCH3 (methoxy group).
   - The methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups are ortho to the cyano group (-CN), confirming their positions.

2. **Substituents and Their Positions**:
   - Position 1: -COOH (carboxylic acid).
   - Position 2: -OH (hydroxyl).
   - Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde).
   - Position 4: -OCH3 (methoxy).
   - Position 5: -CN (cyano).
   - Position 6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).

3. **Alphabetical Order of Substituents**:
   - The substituents are listed alphabetically in the IUPAC name: **cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxyl (H), methoxy (M)**.
   - The substituents and their positions are:
     - 3-cyano.
     - 6-(dimethylamino).
     - 5-formyl.
     - 2-hydroxy.
     - 4-methoxy.

4. **Correct IUPAC Name**:
   - Combining the principal group (-COOH, benzoic acid) with the substituents in alphabetical order, the name is:
     **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Matches the derived name exactly.
- **Option B**: Lists substituents in the wrong order (not alphabetical).
- **Option C**: Incorrect substituent arrangement and numbering.
- **Option D**: Incorrect substituent arrangement and numbering.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is given in **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me take it step by step. The question is about naming a benzene ring with several substituents, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name from the given options.

First, I'll try to visualize the benzene ring. The benzene has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. These three are all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means they are separated by two carbons. So, if I imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon, each substituent is two positions away from the others.

Wait, no, wait. Meta is when substituents are on positions 1, 3, and 5 of the ring. But in this case, all three are meta to one another. That probably means they form a triangle on the ring. But I'm not sure about thatâ€”maybe each is two carbons apart from the others.

Wait, another thought: the problem says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other. So, each of them is meta to the others. So, for example, if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then the aldehyde is in position 3, and the cyano is in position 5. But wait, that's the same as each being in a meta position relative to each other because they are spaced two positions apart. So, that's how they're arranged.

Now, the problem goes on. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. Wait, ortho is the adjacent positions, so if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, positions 2 and 6 have a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) group.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is the position across the ring. So if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the para position is 4. So, position 4 has the methoxy group (-OCH3).

Also, the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is the cyano group, right? So, the cyano group is in position 5 (if I followed the earlier arrangement). So, the substituents ortho to cyano (position 5) would be positions 4 and 6. Wait, position 4 is the methoxy and position 6 is the dimethylamino. But in the problem statement, it says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. But earlier I thought that the hydroxyl is at position 2.

Wait, maybe I got the positions wrong. Let me try to map this out again.

Let me assign positions 1 through 6 in a benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Then, since the carboxylic acid is meta to both the aldehyde and the cyano group, the aldehyde would be in position 3, and the cyano in position 5. Wait, or maybe the aldehyde is in position 5 and the cyano in position 3? Hmm, but the main substituent is the carboxylic acid, so that's going to be the principal functional group, and its position will be the numbering starting point.

Wait, when numbering substituents on a benzene ring, the numbering starts at the principal functional group. Since this is a benzoic acid (because it has a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring), the principal group is the carboxylic acid. The numbering starts at the carboxylic acid as position 1.

So, substituting positions based on that:

- Position 1: -COOH (carboxylic acid)
- Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde)
- Position 5: -CN (cyano)

Now, the substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. According to the problem, these are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2). So, positions 2 and 6 have these groups.

Wait, but which is which? Position 2 and 6. The problem doesn't specify, but looking at the options, I might need to figure that out.

Additionally, the para position to the carboxylic acid is position 4. So, position 4 has the methoxy group (-OCH3).

Now, about the nitrile group in position 5. The problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. So, the substituents on positions 4 and 6 are ortho to the cyano (position 5). Because position 5 is attached to the cyano group, the ortho positions would be 4 and 6. So, position 4 is methoxy, position 6 is dimethylamino. Wait, but then the hydroxyl is in position 2, and the dimethylamino is in position 6.

Wait, but dimethylamino is in position 6, which is ortho to the carboxylic acid in position 1. So, that fits the initial condition: ortho to the acid are hydroxyl (position 2) and dimethylamino (position 6). And position 4 is methoxy, which is para to the acid.

Now, the nitrile is in position 5. The substituents ortho to it are positions 4 and 6. So, position 4 is methoxy and position 6 is dimethylamino. But the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the alcohol is in position 2, which is not adjacent to position 5. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I got the positions wrong. Let me try again. Let's see:

If the substituents meta to each other are the carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano, their positions should be 1,3,5. So, position 1 is COOH, 3 is CHO, 5 is CN.

Ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. These are occupied by -OH and N(CH3)2. Let's say, position 2 is -OH and 6 is N(CH3)2.

The para position to COOH is position 4, which is OCH3.

Now, the nitrile is in position 5. The substituents ortho to it are positions 4 and 6. So position 4 is OCH3, and position 6 is N(CH3)2.

So the problem statement says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. But the alcohol is in position 2, which is meta to position 5. Therefore, position 2 isn't ortho to 5. That's a problem. So maybe my initial assumption about the positions is wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps the aldehyde is in position 3, the cyano in position 5, and the carboxylic acid in position 1. Then, the substituents ortho to the acid (1) are 2 and 6: -OH and N(CH3)2.

The methoxy is in position 4, para to 1. Now, the nitrile is in 5. So the substituents ortho to 5 are positions 4 and 6. So position 4 is OCH3 and position 6 is N(CH3)2. But the problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. The alcohol is in position 2, which is not ortho to position 5. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. There's a contradiction here.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is in position 5, and the cyano in position 3. Let me try that. So position 1: COOH, position 3: CN, position 5: CHO.

Then, the substituents ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6: -OH and N(CH3)2.

Para to COOH is position 4: OCH3.

Now, the nitrile is in position 3. The substituents ortho to it are 2 and 4. So, position 2 is -OH and position 4 is OCH3. That makes sense because both are ortho to position 3 (CN). So the problem statement says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. So that's correct.

So now, let me list all substituents:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: -OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: N(CH3)2

Wait, no, because the substituent in position 6 is N(CH3)2, which is ortho to COOH (position 1).

But position 6 is also ortho to nitrile (position 3)? No, position 3's ortho positions are 2 and 4. So position 6 is meta to the nitrile. So that doesn't fit the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look at the positions again.

If the nitrile is in position 3, its ortho positions are 2 and 4.

So, the substituents in those positions are -OH (position 2) and OCH3 (position 4). So both are ortho to CN. That's correct.

So, the substituents in position 6 is N(CH3)2, which is ortho to COOH (position 1) but not ortho to CN (position 3). So that's okay because the problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to CN, which they are.

So now, substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

Wait, wait a second. Where's the aldehyde group? The problem states that the carbaldehyde is meta to the carboxylic acid and meta to the cyano. So, if the carboxylic acid is in 1, and CN in 3, then the aldehyde should be in 5. So, position 5 is CHO.

So, substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

Now, the IUPAC name.

The principal group is the carboxylic acid, so the suffix is -oic acid. The numbering starts at the COOH group as position 1. So the longest chain is the benzene ring, which is numbered accordingly.

Now, the substituents are:

Position 2: OH (hydroxyl)

Position 3: CN (cyano)

Position 4: OCH3 (methoxy)

Position 5: CHO (carbaldehyde, formyl)

Position 6: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but when naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except for the principal functional group.

Wait, the order of substituents is based on their position numbers, but in the name, they are arranged alphabetically, with the exception that the principal suffix comes first.

Wait no, the substituents are listed in order of their positions, but the name lists them in alphabetical order except for the principal group.

Wait, no, wait. In IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. But the numbering is determined based on the substituents to give the lowest possible numbers.

But wait, in this case, the principal group is the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to that.

So, the substituents are:

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

Now, the substituents are:

At position 2: -OH => hydroxyl

Position 3: -CN => cyano

Position 4: -OCH3 => methoxy

Position 5: -CHO => formyl

Position 6: -N(CH3)2 => dimethylamino

So, the substituents, when naming, are listed in alphabetical order. Let's list them:

Cyano (CN) comes first alphabetically.

Then dimethylamino (comes after C?), no, wait, alphabetical order is based on the substituent's prefix. Let me list all substituents:

- hydroxyl (OH)
- cyano (CN)
- methoxy (OCH3)
- formyl (CHO)
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Wait, the substituents are:

1. -CN (cyano)
2. -CHO (formyl)
3. -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
4. -OCH3 (methoxy)
5. -OH (hydroxyl)

Wait, but when arranging alphabetically, we look at the substituent's prefix. Let's see:

The substituents are:

- Cyano (CN)

- Formyl (CHO)

- Hydroxyl (OH)

- Methoxy (OCH3)

- Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name. Let's list the substituents in order:

1. Cyano (CN)

2. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

3. Formyl (CHO)

4. Hydroxyl (OH)

5. Methoxy (OCH3)

Wait, no, their order is based on the first letter of the substituent's name. So, C, D, F, H, M.

Wait, the substituent names are:

- Cyanide (CN)

Wait, no, the substituent is the cyano group, which is named as cyano.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order are:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

So the order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

But wait, the substituent at each position is:

Position 2: OH â†’ hydroxyl

Position 3: CN â†’ cyano

Position 4: OCH3 â†’ methoxy

Position 5: CHO â†’ formyl

Position 6: N(CH3)2 â†’ dimethylamino

So, substituents and their positions:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

So, the order in the name would be:

Benzoic acid is the main group. The substituents are listed as follows: cyano at position 3, then dimethylamino at position 6, formyl at position 5, hydroxyl at position 2, methoxy at position 4.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are in the order of their positions, but in the name, they are listed alphabetically, regardless of their position. So the order in the name would be:

Cyano (C), Dimethylamino (D), Formyl (F), Hydroxyl (H), Methoxy (M).

But in the correct name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so the order in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the substituents are in positions 2,3,4,5,6. So the numbering is 1 (COOH), then 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CHO), 6 (N(CH3)2).

So when writing the name, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not based on their positions. So the order would be:

C (cyano) comes first. Then D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

So the substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but in the options, looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

But wait, the substituent positions are 2,3,4,5,6. So in the name, they are listed in the order of their substituent names. So:

First comes the substituent with the earliest position number, but no, wait, the IUPAC name lists substituents in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name, not in the order of their positions.

So the order is:

1. Cyano (position 3)

2. Dimethylamino (position 6)

3. Formyl (position 5)

4. Hydroxyl (position 2)

5. Methoxy (position 4)

Wait, but when you list them alphabetically, the order is:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

So the substituents are listed as:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Putting it all together, the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. That's exactly what I have.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Option B's substituents are in the order hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6). But the problem is that when substituents are listed alphabetically, the order is as in option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the substituents in the name.

Wait, the substituents in the name are listed in alphabetical order of their names, but their numbering is based on their positions.

So the name would be:

benzoic acid with substituents at positions 2 (hydroxy), 3 (cyano), 4 (methoxy), 5 (formyl), 6 (dimethylamino).

But when written, the substituents are in the order of their alphabetical names:

C comes first (cyano at 3), then D (dimethylamino at 6), then F (formyl at 5), then H (hydroxy at 2), then M (methoxy at 4).

Wait, that can't be correct because the substituents are at 2,3,4,5,6, but the order in the name is based on the substituent's name, not their position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are listed in the order of their positions when the starting point is the principal group.

No, no. The correct approach is:

The principal group is the benzoic acid. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions, but each is numbered based on their position.

So the substituent order in the name will be:

Cyano (C), Dimethylamino (D), Formyl (F), Hydroxy (H), Methoxy (M).

So the substituents are:

3-cyano,

6-(dimethylamino),

5-formyl,

2-hydroxy,

4-methoxy.

So the name is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

But let me look at the options again.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, the correct order is option A, right? Because the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So cyano comes first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy.

So the substituents in the name are 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

So the correct option is A.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in the name, substituents are listed in the order of their positions, but no, I think IUPAC requires substituents to be in alphabetical order. Let me confirm.

Yes, in IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except when the substituent's position is lower when listed in numerical order. Wait, no, actually, substituents are listed in alphabetical order regardless of their position numbers. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible set of numbers, but once the numbering is fixed, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order of their names, not position.

So the substituents are listed in the name as:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait, but looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

In option B, the substituents are in the order: hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino. But that's not the correct alphabetical order. Because C comes before D, F, H, M. So cyano should come first. Therefore, option A is correct.


The problem involves determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with multiple substituents. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all meta to each other. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group, and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy (-OCH3) group. The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are also ortho to the cyano group.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Positioning of Substituents**:
   - The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is at position 1 (the principal functional group).
   - The carbaldehyde (-CHO) is at position 3 (meta to -COOH).
   - The cyano group (-CN) is at position 5 (meta to -COOH and -CHO).
   - Ortho to -COOH (positions 2 and 6) are -OH (position 2) and -N(CH3)2 (position 6).
   - Para to -COOH (position 4) is -OCH3 (methoxy group).
   - The methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups are ortho to the cyano group (-CN), confirming their positions.

2. **Substituents and Their Positions**:
   - Position 1: -COOH (carboxylic acid).
   - Position 2: -OH (hydroxyl).
   - Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde).
   - Position 4: -OCH3 (methoxy).
   - Position 5: -CN (cyano).
   - Position 6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).

3. **Alphabetical Order of Substituents**:
   - The substituents are listed alphabetically in the IUPAC name: **cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxyl (H), methoxy (M)**.
   - The substituents and their positions are:
     - 3-cyano.
     - 6-(dimethylamino).
     - 5-formyl.
     - 2-hydroxy.
     - 4-methoxy.

4. **Correct IUPAC Name**:
   - Combining the principal group (-COOH, benzoic acid) with the substituents in alphabetical order, the name is:
     **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Matches the derived name exactly.
- **Option B**: Lists substituents in the wrong order (not alphabetical).
- **Option C**: Incorrect substituent arrangement and numbering.
- **Option D**: Incorrect substituent arrangement and numbering.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is given in **Option A**.

Answer: A
