Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. 

The question is about an electron's spin state and some operator. Let me read the problem again carefully.

We have a state |alpha> that's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of spin, S_z. So, the state is a linear combination of these basis states. The first thing I should probably do is normalize this state because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes. 

Wait, the question says the state is proportional to that combination, so I need to find the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but it's not normalized yet. The normalization factor is 1 divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

Calculating the coefficients: (1+i) has magnitude sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2). (2 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So the squared magnitudes are 2 and 5, respectively. Adding them gives 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, the operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out. Since for a spin-½ system, the basis is |up> and |down>, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, the elements are ħ/2. So rows and columns: (row 1, column 2) and (row2, column1) are ħ/2, others are zero.

Wait, no: the matrix is constructed with A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j. So for 2x2, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So yes, the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. 

Wait, but what operator is this? It looks similar to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

But I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet. Alternatively, perhaps I need to find the eigenstates of this operator because the question is about measuring the state in the eigenbasis of A.

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of A when the system is in state |alpha>, and also the average value of A.

Hmm, so to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, and then compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenvector.

Wait, but A has a specific form. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) =0.

So determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] = λ^2 - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) =0.

So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 => λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's take λ= ħ/2 first.

(A - (ħ/2) I) |v> =0.

The matrix becomes:

[ [ -ħ/2 , ħ/2 ],
  [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

Equation 1: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 => -v1 + v2=0 => v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1,1]^T. But considering the Pauli matrix, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which have equal parts |up> and |down>. Similarly, for λ=-ħ/2.

Wait but wait, the eigenvectors for λ= ħ/2 would be [1, 1]^T. But they need to be normalized. The norm is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,1]^T. Which corresponds to the state |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). 

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T, which is |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

Now, to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, |alpha> is already in terms of |up> and |down>. So perhaps it's easier to express |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>, and then compute the inner product.

Let me write:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 − i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Let me compute the amplitude for |+x>:

⟨+x | alpha⟩ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( ⟨up| + ⟨down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7)|down> ]

So this is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|up⟩ + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|up⟩ ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|down⟩ + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|down⟩ ].

But ⟨up|up⟩ =1, ⟨down|down⟩=1, and ⟨up|down⟩=0.

So simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2−i)/sqrt(7)*0 ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ 0 + (2−i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) + (2−i) ]

Compute that inside: (1+i +2−i) = 3. So the amplitude is (3)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, the amplitude for |−x> is ⟨−x | alpha⟩.

⟨−x | alpha⟩ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (⟨up| − ⟨down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2−i)/sqrt(7)*0 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *0 + (2−i)/sqrt(7)*1 ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) [ (1 +i) - (2 −i) ] = (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (1 +i -2 +i) ] = ( (-1 + 2i) )/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, that gives the probabilities as 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. Close to our approximate 0.643 and 0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation for the amplitude of |−x>. 

Wait, let me recompute ⟨−x | alpha⟩:

⟨−x | alpha⟩ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (⟨up| - ⟨down| ) ] times [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] all over sqrt(7).

So (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)⟨up|up⟩ - (1+i)⟨up|down⟩ + (2−i)⟨down|up⟩ - (2−i)⟨down|down⟩ ]

Since ⟨up|down⟩=0, it's:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) - (2−i)(1) ]

So (1+i) - (2 −i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.357.

So probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.6429) and 5/14 (≈0.3571). So the closest option is A, which says 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded, so option A's first two numbers match.

But the question also asks for the average value of the operator. The average value is given by ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the probabilities p_+ and p_-, the average would be (p_+)(ħ/2) + (p_-)(-ħ/2) = (p_+ - p_-) * ħ/2.

But p_+ is 9/14, p_- is5/14. So (9/14 -5/14)=4/14=2/7. So average is (2/7)*(ħ/2) )= ħ/(7).

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, average is ħ/7. So option A is the correct one.

Wait but let me think about another approach. The operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the expected value is (ħ/2) ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. So ⟨sigma_x⟩ is the expectation value in state |alpha>.

Another way to compute it is to calculate:

⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, matrix multiplication. Let me compute it step by step.

First, multiply the row vector [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] with σ_x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Then multiply by the column vector.

So σ_x |alpha⟩ is the same as the matrix multiplied by the vector.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute matrix elements.

Alternatively, let me compute ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So ⟨alpha| = (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up| + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when acting on |up>, it becomes |down>, and on |down>, it becomes |up>.

So σ_x |alpha> = (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up>.

Then, ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up| + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down| ] [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (1 +i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Wait, because σ_x |alpha> is (2 -i)|up> + (1 +i)|down>, right? Because σ_x swaps the components.

Wait, let me recompute σ_x |alpha>.

Wait |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

σ_x |up> = |down>, σ_x |down> = |up>.

So σ_x |alpha> = (1+i) |down> + (2 -i) |up>.

So σ_x |alpha> = (2 -i)|up> + (1 +i)|down>.

So the inner product is:

⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] · [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, because when you compute the inner product, the row vector multiplies the column vector.

So:

= [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] / (7)

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i + i + (-1) = (2-1) + 3i = 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So ⟨sigma_x⟩ = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7, which matches our previous calculation.

So the average is ħ/7, which corresponds to option A.

So according to all this, the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron's spin state, |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise, as well as the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i). The magnitudes of these coefficients are:

- |1+i| = √(1² + 1²) = √2
- |2-i| = √(2² + (-1)²) = √5

The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates and eigenvalues of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalues of A are found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

The corresponding eigenstates are:

- For λ = +ħ/2: \( |+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩) \)
- For λ = -ħ/2: \( |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩) \)

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩
The state |α⟩ is already expressed in terms of |up⟩ and |down⟩. To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of A, we compute the overlap of |α⟩ with |+x⟩ and |-x⟩.

#### Amplitude for |+x⟩:
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) \langle up|up⟩ + (2-i) \langle down|up⟩ \right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) \langle up|down⟩ + (2-i) \langle down|down⟩ \right)
\]

Since \( \langle up|up⟩ = 1 \), \( \langle down|down⟩ = 1 \), and \( \langle up|down⟩ = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is:

\[
P(+x) = |⟨+x|α⟩|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64
\]

#### Amplitude for |-x⟩:
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) \langle up|up⟩ + (2-i) \langle down|up⟩ \right) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) \langle up|down⟩ + (2-i) \langle down|down⟩ \right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probability of measuring -ħ/2 is:

\[
P(-x) = |⟨-x|α⟩|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{(9 - 5)}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This corresponds to **Option A**.
