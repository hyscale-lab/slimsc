Okay, so today I've got this quantum mechanics problem to work through. Hmm, it's about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Let me try to remember what I've learned so far.

The problem says the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Oh wait, so it's in polar coordinates, right? Because r and θ are the variables here. So the particle is moving in two dimensions, meaning it's in a plane, probably the xy-plane.

I think I remember that when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates, sometimes the problem can be solved using separation of variables. Like, maybe it's separable into radial and angular parts. Let me think about this.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So I can factor out r², which gives V = (k r²) [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Let me see, 1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ can be simplified. Let me calculate that.

1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ is equal to [1 + 3 cos²θ]/2. So V(r,θ) = (k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ)) / 2. Hmm, that might be useful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express cos²θ in terms of a double angle formula. Because I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me substitute that in.

So substituting, V becomes (k r² [1 + 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 ]) / 2. Let's compute that step by step.

First, 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 is (3/2)(1 + cos2θ). Adding 1 gives 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ. Wait, wait, no. No, I think I got confused there. Let me correct that.

Wait, the original expression after substitution is 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ), all multiplied by k r² and divided by 2. So expanding that:

1 + (3/2)(1) is 1 + 3/2 = 5/2. Then (3/2) cos2θ. So putting it all together, V(r,θ) = (k r²) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] / 2. Wait, because the entire [1 + 3 cos²θ] is multiplied by 1/2, right?

Wait, maybe I should recompute that substitution. Let me try again.

Original V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Substitute cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.

So 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ. Combining constants: 1 is 2/2, so 2/2 +3/2 =5/2. So it becomes (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) * [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (k r²) [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, that might not be the easiest way to handle this. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts.

Wait, maybe another approach. The potential has a term proportional to r² and another term that's r² cos²θ. So perhaps I can think of this as a sum of two potentials: one that depends only on r, and another that depends on θ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the entire Hamiltonian and see if it's separable. The Hamiltonian is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ).

In polar coordinates, the kinetic energy in 2D is (p_r² + p_θ² / r² )/(2m). So the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = [ (p_r²) / (2m) + (p_θ²) / (2m r²) ) ] + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange the terms to see if they can be expressed as sums of functions that depend on r and θ separately.

Wait, the potential has terms in r² and r² cos²θ. So let me factor out r²: V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

So H becomes:

H = [ p_r²/(2m) + p_θ²/(2m r²) ] + (k r² / 2) (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for the angular part: cos²θ can be written in terms of cos2θ, as I did earlier. So perhaps I can write the angular part as a function that depends on θ, but then again, I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can separate the variables. Let me think about the form of the Hamiltonian. Suppose the potential can be expressed as a sum of a function of r and a function of θ. Then the Hamiltonian would be separable, which would allow us to write the solution as a product of radial and angular parts.

Wait, let me check that. The current potential is V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Let me see if this can be written as V(r) + W(θ), where V(r) is a function of r only, and W(θ) is a function of θ only.

Wait, in this case, V(r,θ) can be written as [ (k r² / 2) ] + [ (3 k r² cos²θ ) / 2 ].

Wait, but the [3 k r² cos²θ / 2] term still depends on r. So it's not purely a function of θ. Hmm. So that suggests that the potential isn't separable into r and θ parts. So perhaps the problem isn't directly separable, which complicates things.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted coordinate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a coordinate transformation that makes the problem separable.

Wait, let me think about this: the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out 1/2 k r²: that gives V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Hmm, perhaps I can express [1 + 3 cos²θ ] in terms of something else. For example, cos²θ is (1 + cos 2θ)/2, so 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = (2/2) + (3/2) + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (k r²) [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, so now the potential is V(r,θ) = (5k r²/4) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

Hmm.

But wait, the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is H_kin = [p_r^2/(2m)] + [p_θ^2)/(2m r²)].

So putting it all together, the Hamiltonian is:

H = [p_r^2/(2m) + p_θ^2/(2m r²) ] + (5k r²/4) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

This seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can manipulate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a sum of a radial part and an angular part.

Wait, let me consider that. Let's see:

H = [p_r^2/(2m) + (5k r²/4) ] + [ p_θ^2/(2m r²) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, but the second term in the second bracket still depends on r, because of the (3k r²/4) cos2θ. So that complicates things. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for angular momentum. Wait, the angular part of the Hamiltonian could be expressed in terms of L_z, the angular momentum about the z-axis. Because in polar coordinates, the angular momentum operator L_z is -iℏ ∂/∂θ, so L_z² would be -ℏ² ∂²/∂θ².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly with the cos2θ term. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the presence of the cos2θ term suggests that the system has angular components that depend on even multiples of θ. So perhaps the wavefunction can be expressed in terms of even functions, like cos(2θ) or sin(2θ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering a displacement in the angular variable. Let me think about that. For example, if I perform a substitution like φ = 2θ, then cos2θ becomes cosφ. But I'm not sure if that helps in the separation of variables.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the form of the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes, a potential that depends on cosθ or sinθ can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, making it easier to separate variables.

In 2D polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, and cos2θ would be (x² - y²)/(r²). Hmm, maybe I can express the potential in terms of x and y.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's compute cos²θ in terms of x and y.

cos²θ = (x²)/(r²) = (x²)/(x² + y²).

So substituting, V becomes:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x²)/(x² + y²) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 (x²)/(x² + y²)].

Hmm, perhaps that can be simplified. Let's factor out r²:

V = (k/2) [ r² + 3 r² (x²)/(x² + y²) ].

Hmm, but r² is x² + y², so substituting that in:

V = (k/2) [ (x² + y²) + 3 (x² + y²)(x²)/(x² + y²) ) ].

Simplify that: the (x² + y²) in the numerator and denominator cancels for the second term.

So V = (k/2) [ x² + y² + 3 x² ] = (k/2)(4x² + y²) = (k/2)(4x² + y²).

Wait, that's interesting! So the potential simplifies to V(x,y) = (k/2)(4x² + y²). That's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, but with different coefficients in each direction. So in x-direction, it's 4x², and in y-direction, it's y², multiplied by k/2.

Wait, that makes sense because in Cartesian coordinates, a harmonic oscillator potential would be V = (m ω² /2)(x² + y²), but here it's more like V = (something) x² + (something else) y². Oh, wait, but in the problem statement, the potential is in terms of r and θ, so perhaps that's why it's expressed in that form.

Wait, so if I can write V(x,y) as (k/2)(4x² + y²), then that's a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for such a system are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x is sqrt(k/(m)) for the x-direction, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the frequency for each direction depends on the coefficient.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ℏ ω for each degree of freedom. But in this case, the potential in x is (k/2)(4x²) = 2 k x². So to get the standard form, (1/2) m ω² x², the ω for x would be sqrt( (2k) / m ), because 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me correct that. Let's consider each direction separately.

In the x-direction:

V_x = (k/2)(4 x²) = 2k x².

So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → m ω_x² = 4k → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, in the y-direction:

V_y = (k/2) y² → (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction has its own frequency. Therefore, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

In the harmonic oscillator, the energy for each direction is E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = [n_x + n_y + 1] (ℏ/2) (2 sqrt(k/m) + sqrt(k/m)).

Wait, no. Wait, no, because E_x is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and E_y is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Factor out sqrt(k/m) and ℏ:

E = [ (2(n_x + 1/2) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
= (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option C) E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). That's exactly what I have here. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We started by expressing the potential in terms of x and y and found V(x,y) = (k/2)(4x² + y²). So that's correct.

Then, we treated each direction as a harmonic oscillator.

For x: (k/2)(4x²) = 2k x². So (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

For y: (k/2) y² → (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Then, each direction contributes (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So for x: (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m). For y: (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

Adding them together:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) ℏ + (n_y + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Factor out sqrt(k/m) ℏ:

E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Expanding:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Combine the constants: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which matches option C. So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). The potential is expressed in polar coordinates, but it can be simplified by transforming it into Cartesian coordinates.

### Key Steps:
1. **Simplify the Potential**:  
   The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{k}{2} \left( 4x^2 + y^2 \right).
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential in the \( x \)-direction is \( 4x^2 \) and in the \( y \)-direction is \( y^2 \).

2. **Energy Levels in Each Direction**:  
   For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by \( E = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. The frequencies for the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions are determined from the potential coefficients:  
   - For \( x \)-direction: \( \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).  
   - For \( y \)-direction: \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

   The energy contributions from each direction are:  
   \[
   E_x = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_x = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}},
   \]  
   \[
   E_y = \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_y = \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from both directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:  
   \[
   E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Correct Option:
The energy spectrum matches the form given in **Option C**:  
\[
E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Answer: C

Okay, so today I've got this quantum mechanics problem to work through. Hmm, it's about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Let me try to remember what I've learned so far.

The problem says the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Oh wait, so it's in polar coordinates, right? Because r and θ are the variables here. So the particle is moving in two dimensions, meaning it's in a plane, probably the xy-plane.

I think I remember that when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates, sometimes the problem can be solved using separation of variables. Like, maybe it's separable into radial and angular parts. Let me think about this.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So I can factor out r², which gives V = (k r²) [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Let me see, 1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ can be simplified. Let me calculate that.

1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ is equal to [1 + 3 cos²θ]/2. So V(r,θ) = (k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ)) / 2. Hmm, that might be useful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express cos²θ in terms of a double angle formula. Because I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me substitute that in.

So substituting, V becomes (k r² [1 + 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 ]) / 2. Let's compute that step by step.

First, 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 is (3/2)(1 + cos2θ). Adding 1 gives 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ. Wait, wait, no. No, I think I got confused there. Let me correct that.

Wait, the original expression after substitution is 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ), all multiplied by k r² and divided by 2. So expanding that:

1 + (3/2)(1) is 1 + 3/2 = 5/2. Then (3/2) cos2θ. So putting it all together, V(r,θ) = (k r²) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] / 2. Wait, because the entire [1 + 3 cos²θ] is multiplied by 1/2, right?

Wait, maybe I should recompute that substitution. Let me try again.

Original V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Substitute cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.

So 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ. Combining constants: 1 is 2/2, so 2/2 +3/2 =5/2. So it becomes (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) * [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (k r²) [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, that might not be the easiest way to handle this. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts.

Wait, maybe another approach. The potential has a term proportional to r² and another term that's r² cos²θ. So perhaps I can think of this as a sum of two potentials: one that depends only on r, and another that depends on θ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the entire Hamiltonian and see if it's separable. The Hamiltonian is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ).

In polar coordinates, the kinetic energy in 2D is (p_r² + p_θ² / r² )/(2m). So the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = [ (p_r²) / (2m) + (p_θ²) / (2m r²) ) ] + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange the terms to see if they can be expressed as sums of functions that depend on r and θ separately.

Wait, the potential has terms in r² and r² cos²θ. So let me factor out r²: V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

So H becomes:

H = [ p_r²/(2m) + p_θ²/(2m r²) ] + (k r² / 2) (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for the angular part: cos²θ can be written in terms of cos2θ, as I did earlier. So perhaps I can write the angular part as a function that depends on θ, but then again, I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can separate the variables. Let me think about the form of the Hamiltonian. Suppose the potential can be expressed as a sum of a function of r and a function of θ. Then the Hamiltonian would be separable, which would allow us to write the solution as a product of radial and angular parts.

Wait, let me check that. The current potential is V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Let me see if this can be written as V(r) + W(θ), where V(r) is a function of r only, and W(θ) is a function of θ only.

Wait, in this case, V(r,θ) can be written as [ (k r² / 2) ] + [ (3 k r² cos²θ ) / 2 ].

Wait, but the [3 k r² cos²θ / 2] term still depends on r. So it's not purely a function of θ. Hmm. So that suggests that the potential isn't separable into r and θ parts. So perhaps the problem isn't directly separable, which complicates things.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted coordinate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a coordinate transformation that makes the problem separable.

Wait, let me think about this: the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out 1/2 k r²: that gives V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Hmm, perhaps I can express [1 + 3 cos²θ ] in terms of something else. For example, cos²θ is (1 + cos 2θ)/2, so 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = (2/2) + (3/2) + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (k r²) [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, so now the potential is V(r,θ) = (5k r²/4) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

Hmm.

But wait, the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is H_kin = [p_r^2/(2m)] + [p_θ^2)/(2m r²)].

So putting it all together, the Hamiltonian is:

H = [p_r^2/(2m) + p_θ^2/(2m r²) ] + (5k r²/4) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ.

This seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can manipulate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a sum of a radial part and an angular part.

Wait, let me consider that. Let's see:

H = [p_r^2/(2m) + (5k r²/4) ] + [ p_θ^2/(2m r²) + (3k r²/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, but the second term in the second bracket still depends on r, because of the (3k r²/4) cos2θ. So that complicates things. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for angular momentum. Wait, the angular part of the Hamiltonian could be expressed in terms of L_z, the angular momentum about the z-axis. Because in polar coordinates, the angular momentum operator L_z is -iℏ ∂/∂θ, so L_z² would be -ℏ² ∂²/∂θ².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly with the cos2θ term. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the presence of the cos2θ term suggests that the system has angular components that depend on even multiples of θ. So perhaps the wavefunction can be expressed in terms of even functions, like cos(2θ) or sin(2θ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering a displacement in the angular variable. Let me think about that. For example, if I perform a substitution like φ = 2θ, then cos2θ becomes cosφ. But I'm not sure if that helps in the separation of variables.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the form of the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes, a potential that depends on cosθ or sinθ can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, making it easier to separate variables.

In 2D polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, and cos2θ would be (x² - y²)/(r²). Hmm, maybe I can express the potential in terms of x and y.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's compute cos²θ in terms of x and y.

cos²θ = (x²)/(r²) = (x²)/(x² + y²).

So substituting, V becomes:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x²)/(x² + y²) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 (x²)/(x² + y²)].

Hmm, perhaps that can be simplified. Let's factor out r²:

V = (k/2) [ r² + 3 r² (x²)/(x² + y²) ].

Hmm, but r² is x² + y², so substituting that in:

V = (k/2) [ (x² + y²) + 3 (x² + y²)(x²)/(x² + y²) ) ].

Simplify that: the (x² + y²) in the numerator and denominator cancels for the second term.

So V = (k/2) [ x² + y² + 3 x² ] = (k/2)(4x² + y²) = (k/2)(4x² + y²).

Wait, that's interesting! So the potential simplifies to V(x,y) = (k/2)(4x² + y²). That's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, but with different coefficients in each direction. So in x-direction, it's 4x², and in y-direction, it's y², multiplied by k/2.

Wait, that makes sense because in Cartesian coordinates, a harmonic oscillator potential would be V = (m ω² /2)(x² + y²), but here it's more like V = (something) x² + (something else) y². Oh, wait, but in the problem statement, the potential is in terms of r and θ, so perhaps that's why it's expressed in that form.

Wait, so if I can write V(x,y) as (k/2)(4x² + y²), then that's a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for such a system are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x is sqrt(k/(m)) for the x-direction, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the frequency for each direction depends on the coefficient.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ℏ ω for each degree of freedom. But in this case, the potential in x is (k/2)(4x²) = 2 k x². So to get the standard form, (1/2) m ω² x², the ω for x would be sqrt( (2k) / m ), because 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me correct that. Let's consider each direction separately.

In the x-direction:

V_x = (k/2)(4 x²) = 2k x².

So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → m ω_x² = 4k → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, in the y-direction:

V_y = (k/2) y² → (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction has its own frequency. Therefore, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

In the harmonic oscillator, the energy for each direction is E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = [n_x + n_y + 1] (ℏ/2) (2 sqrt(k/m) + sqrt(k/m)).

Wait, no. Wait, no, because E_x is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and E_y is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Factor out sqrt(k/m) and ℏ:

E = [ (2(n_x + 1/2) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
= (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option C) E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). That's exactly what I have here. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We started by expressing the potential in terms of x and y and found V(x,y) = (k/2)(4x² + y²). So that's correct.

Then, we treated each direction as a harmonic oscillator.

For x: (k/2)(4x²) = 2k x². So (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

For y: (k/2) y² → (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Then, each direction contributes (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So for x: (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m). For y: (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

Adding them together:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) ℏ + (n_y + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Factor out sqrt(k/m) ℏ:

E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Expanding:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Combine the constants: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which matches option C. So that's the correct answer.


The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). The potential is expressed in polar coordinates, but it can be simplified by transforming it into Cartesian coordinates.

### Key Steps:
1. **Simplify the Potential**:  
   The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{k}{2} \left( 4x^2 + y^2 \right).
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential in the \( x \)-direction is \( 4x^2 \) and in the \( y \)-direction is \( y^2 \).

2. **Energy Levels in Each Direction**:  
   For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by \( E = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. The frequencies for the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions are determined from the potential coefficients:  
   - For \( x \)-direction: \( \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).  
   - For \( y \)-direction: \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

   The energy contributions from each direction are:  
   \[
   E_x = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_x = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}},
   \]  
   \[
   E_y = \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_y = \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from both directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:  
   \[
   E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Correct Option:
The energy spectrum matches the form given in **Option C**:  
\[
E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Answer: C
