Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Oh right, that's important because σz has definite eigenvalues for those states.

The operator we're interested in is 10σz +5σx. So, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier to compute each part separately.

First, I'll compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in state |↑⟩ is +1 and for |↓⟩ it's -1. So, to find ⟨σz⟩, I can write it as the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the coefficients are a=0.5 for |↑⟩ and b= sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. So, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2. Let me calculate that.

|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So, that part is -0.5.

Now, the operator part is 10σz, so 10 times ⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now, the other part is 5⟨σx⟩. Hmm, how do I compute ⟨σx⟩ for this state? I remember that σx is the Pauli x matrix and it doesn't share the same eigenstates as σz. So, I can't directly use the same approach as with σz. I need to find the expectation value of σx in the state ψ.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of σx is equal to the expectation value of the operator (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) multiplied by 2, because σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. Alternatively, I think I can compute it using the state's coefficients.

Wait, maybe it's easier to remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b)/ (a a* + b b*)? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, σx can be represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, acting on the state vector [a, b], it would give [b, a]. Then, the expectation value is the conjugate of the state vector multiplied by σx acting on the state.

So, the state vector ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, actually, in Dirac notation, the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, so the vector is [a, b]^T. So, the expectation value of σx is ψ† σx ψ.

So, computing that:

⟨σx⟩ = [a*, b*] * σx * [a, b]^T.

Let me compute that. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying it by [a, b] gives [b, a]. Then, [a*, b*] multiplied by [b, a] is a* b + b* a.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = a* b + a b*.

In this case, a is 0.5 (real), and b is sqrt(3)/2 (also real). So, a* = a, and b* = b. So, it's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

a* b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.4330.

Similarly, a b* is the same, since both are real. So, adding them gives 0.8660. So, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

Now, adding the two contributions: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + 4.330 = -0.670.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations because the options don't quite match that. Let me see.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have:

10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.8660) ≈ 4.330.

So, total expectation is -5 +4.330 = -0.670. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me re-calculate.

Another approach: The expectation value can be computed using the matrix representation.

The state ψ is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]].

The operator O is 10σz+5σx = [[10,5],[5,-10]].

The expectation value is ψ† O ψ.

So, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and O ψ is:

Multiplying O with ψ:

First element: 10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 + (5 sqrt(3)/2).

Second element:5*0.5 + (-10) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2.5 -5 sqrt(3).

Now, ψ† O ψ = 0.5*(5 + (5 sqrt(3)/2)) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5 sqrt(3)).

Let me compute each term:

First term: 0.5 *5 = 2.5. 0.5*(5 sqrt(3)/2) = (5 sqrt(3))/4 ≈ (8.660)/4 ≈2.165.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 = (2.5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (4.33)/2 ≈2.165.

Third part: (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5 sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3)*-5 sqrt(3))/2 = (-5 *3)/2 = (-15)/2 = -7.5.

So, putting it all together:

2.5 +2.165 +2.165 -7.5 = (2.5 +4.33) -7.5 = 6.83 -7.5 = -0.67.

Which is approximately -0.67, so rounded to one decimal is -0.7. So, same result.

So, the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is given as \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), so the coefficients are \( a = 0.5 \) (for \( |\uparrow\rangle \)) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) (for \( |\downarrow\rangle \)).

The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (|a|^2)(+1) + (|b|^2)(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) for a state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^* b + a b^*.
\]

Since \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are real, we have:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} = 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

Now, the operator part is 10σz, so 10 times ⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = a* b + a b*.

In this case, a is 0.5 (real), and b is sqrt(3)/2 (also real). So, a* = a, and b* = b. So, it's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

a* b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.4330.

Similarly, a b* is the same, since both are real. So, adding them gives 0.8660. So, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

Now, adding the two contributions: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + 4.330 = -0.670.

5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.8660) ≈ 4.330.

So, total expectation is -5 +4.330 = -0.670. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me re-calculate.

The state ψ is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]].

The operator O is 10σz+5σx = [[10,5],[5,-10]].

The expectation value is ψ† O ψ.

So, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and O ψ is:

Multiplying O with ψ:

First element: 10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 + (5 sqrt(3)/2).

Second element:5*0.5 + (-10) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2.5 -5 sqrt(3).

Now, ψ† O ψ = 0.5*(5 + (5 sqrt(3)/2)) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5 sqrt(3)).

Let me compute each term:

First term: 0.5 *5 = 2.5. 0.5*(5 sqrt(3)/2) = (5 sqrt(3))/4 ≈ (8.660)/4 ≈2.165.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 = (2.5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (4.33)/2 ≈2.165.

Third part: (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5 sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3)*-5 sqrt(3))/2 = (-5 *3)/2 = (-15)/2 = -7.5.

So, putting it all together:

2.5 +2.165 +2.165 -7.5 = (2.5 +4.33) -7.5 = 6.83 -7.5 = -0.67.

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is given as \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), so the coefficients are \( a = 0.5 \) (for \( |\uparrow\rangle \)) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) (for \( |\downarrow\rangle \)).

The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (|a|^2)(+1) + (|b|^2)(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) for a state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^* b + a b^*.
\]

Since \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are real, we have:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} = 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
