Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me figure out what the nucleus is. Lithium usually has 3 protons because the atomic number for Li is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So, the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. So, I'm dealing with relativistic mechanics here. When particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. Instead, we have to use the relativistic formulas.

Wait, but let me think. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think that refers to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Or maybe it's the total energy? Hmm, sometimes in particle physics, the energy mentioned is the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". I remember that colliders typically accelerate particles to a certain energy, which is their kinetic energy, but sometimes it's given as the total energy. Hmm. I think for these types of problems, unless stated otherwise, we usually consider the kinetic energy as the value. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy.

Hmm, but wait, in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe it's the total energy (relativistic energy). Let me think. If the particle is moving at 0.96c, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the gamma factor will be substantial, so the total energy (gamma * m c²) will be much higher than the rest mass energy. So, if the question is asking for the energy, are they referring to the total energy or the kinetic energy?

Wait, the problem states, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, the energy given by the collider should be the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Wait, no—wait, no. Because the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, if the problem is asking for the energy delivered by the collider, perhaps it's the kinetic energy. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the energy refers to the total energy.

Wait, let me think about the standard approach for these problems. Normally, when someone asks for the energy of a particle accelerated in a collider, they're referring to the kinetic energy, unless stated otherwise. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy is asked. Hmm.

But the problem probably wants the kinetic energy, but I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy. Wait, let's think about the formulas.

The total energy E = gamma * m0 c². The kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So, if the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, then K = E - m0 c², so E = K + m0 c².

But in this problem, I'm given the speed, and need to find the energy. So, first, I'll compute gamma. Let's compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v is 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28 (since 0.28^2 = 0.0784). So, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Let's compute that.

Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, the mass of a neutron is a bit higher than a proton. Let me get the exact numbers.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So, each proton is about 938.3 MeV, and each neutron is about 939.57 MeV.

So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) MeV.

Calculating that:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total m0 c² = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, because each nucleon's mass contributes m c², so adding them gives the total rest energy.

Wait, but wait—wait, no. Because the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy. But wait, in this problem, are we supposed to ignore the binding energy and just take the sum? Because if the nucleus is moving, and we are considering its rest mass, then perhaps we should use the actual mass of the Li-6 isotope.

Wait, that's a point I wasn't considering. The rest mass of Li-6 isn't just 3 protons plus 3 neutrons because of the binding energy (mass deficit). So, I think it's better to look up the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate it as 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV. So, 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is about 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but I'm thinking that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given as the sum of the individual nucleons. Or maybe the problem assumes that the rest mass is approximately 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it accurately. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160 grams per mole. Wait, but that's the molar mass. To find the rest mass energy, I can use the conversion 1 u (atomic mass unit) is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So, the molar mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160 g/mol. Wait, but that's the molar mass, so the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is 6.0160 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number.

Wait, but I think that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to take the mass as the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, wait. Let's compute the rest energy of a Li-6 nucleus.

Each proton contributes about 938.272 MeV, each neutron about 939.565 MeV.

So, 3 protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total rest energy: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

But wait, that's the sum of the individual nucleons. The actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is less than that due to the mass defect (binding energy). So, the actual mass is about 6.0160 g/mol. Let me compute that.

Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.94 g/mol? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the atomic weight of Li is about 6.94 on the periodic table. But since Li-6 is an isotope, its atomic weight is approximately 6.016 for Li-6. Wait, perhaps I should double-check that.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.94, but that's an average of the isotopes. The specific isotope Li-6 has a molar mass of approximately 6.016 g/mol.

So, the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is (6.016 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number) per mole.

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 per mole.

So, the mass in grams per nucleus is 6.016 g/mol / 6.022e23 nuclei/mol.

Which is (6.016 / 6.022e23) grams.

Convert grams to kilograms: 6.016 / (6.022e23) ) * 1e-3 kg/g = 6.016e-3 / (6.022e23) kg.

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and perhaps I should use the atomic mass in MeV/c².

1 u (atomic mass unit) is 931.5 MeV/c².

So, Li-6 has a molar mass of 6.016 g/mol. Since 1 g is 1e-3 kg, and 1 mol is 6.022e23 atoms.

So, the mass per nucleus is (6.016 g/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) = (6.016e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) = 6.016e-3 / 6.022e23 kg/atom ≈ 9.99e-27 kg/atom.

Wait, but that's the mass in kilograms. To find the rest energy, we use E = mc².

So, E = 9.99e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute that:

(3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So, E = 9.99e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 8.991e-10 J.

Convert Joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E = 8.991e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.61e9 eV = 5.61 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 5.61 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I added the individual protons and neutrons, I got about 5.63 GeV. So, this is consistent. So the rest mass energy of Li-6 is about 5.61 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me cross-check. Let me compute the mass using the molar mass and atomic mass unit.

Molar mass of Li-6 is 6.016 g/mol.

So, the mass of one Li-6 atom is (6.016 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number) = 6.016e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈ 9.99e-27 kg.

Wait, but 6.016 grams per mole is 0.006016 kg/mol.

So, 0.006016 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = 0.006016 / 6.022e23 kg/atom ≈ 9.99e-27 kg/atom.

So, E = mc² = 9.99e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute that: 9.99e-27 * 9e16 = 8.991e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 8.991e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.61e9 eV = 5.61 GeV.

So, the rest energy is approximately 5.61 GeV.

Hmm, but earlier when I summed the individual protons and neutrons, I got 5.633 GeV. So, which is correct? Oh, because when you sum protons and neutrons, you get a higher value, but the actual nucleus has a lower mass due to binding energy (mass defect). So, the actual rest energy is about 5.61 GeV.

But perhaps in this problem, the intended approach is to use the sum of individual nucleons. Alternatively, since the exact mass isn't given, perhaps we are to use 6 nucleons, each with 938 MeV, giving 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

But wait, in reality, the actual rest mass is a bit less than that. So, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate it as 6 * 938 MeV. Let's proceed with that.

So, m0 c² = 5.628 GeV.

Now, gamma is approximately 3.5714 as calculated before.

So, the total energy E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.628:

3 * 5.628 = 16.884.

0.5714 *5.628 ≈ 3.216.

So, total E ≈ 16.884 + 3.216 = 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.628 = Let's compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857, 3.5714 *0.628 = ?

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.028 = 0.0999 (~0.1 approximately).

So, sum is 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 approximately, plus 0.0999 gives 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it precisely.

5.628 *3.5714.

5 *3.5714 = 17.857.

0.628 *3.5714 = ?

0.6 *3.5714 = 2.14284.

0.028 *3.5714 ≈ 0.099999.

So, 2.14284 + 0.099999 ≈ 2.24284.

So, total 17.857 + 2.24284 = 20.09984 GeV ≈ 20.10 GeV.

But wait, that's when using m0 c² =5.628 GeV.

But earlier, when using the actual molar mass, I got m0 c² =5.61 GeV. Let's see:

3.5714 *5.61 = ?

3 *5.61 =16.83.

0.5714 *5.61 = let's compute.

0.5 *5.61 =2.805.

0.0714 *5.61 ≈0.402.

So, 2.805 +0.402=3.207.

Total E=16.83 +3.207 = 20.037 GeV ≈20.04 GeV.

Hmm, but the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So, wait, if using m0 c² =5.628 GeV, the total energy is about 20.1 GeV. So, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.628.

3.5714 *5.628:

Breakdown:

=3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

Compute 0.5*5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628: 0.07 *5.628=0.394, 0.0014 *5.628≈0.00788. So sum is ~0.394+0.00788=0.40188.

So, 2.814 +0.40188=3.21588.

Total E=16.884 +3.21588=20.09988 GeV≈20.10 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, is there a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, let's recalculate gamma.

Because perhaps I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28, but let's compute it more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So, gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

So, that's correct.

So, the calculation is correct, giving E≈20.1 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps my approximation of m0 c² as 5.628 GeV is a bit off. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0160 grams per mole. So, molar mass=6.0160 g/mol.

Convert to kg/mol: 6.0160e-3 kg/mol.

Avogadro's number is 6.02214076e23 mol^-1.

So, mass per nucleus: (6.0160e-3 kg/mol) / (6.02214076e23 nuclei/mol) = (6.0160e-3) / (6.02214076e23) kg/nucleus.

Compute that:

6.0160e-3 /6.02214076e23 ≈ (6.0160 /6.02214076) *1e-26 kg.

6.0160/6.02214076 ≈0.999.

So, approximately 0.999e-26 kg.

Now, rest energy E = mc².

c=3e8 m/s.

So, E= (0.999e-26 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2.

= 0.999e-26 * 9e16 = 0.999 *9e-10 = 8.991e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV=1.60218e-19 J.

So, E = 8.991e-10 J /1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈5.611e9 eV =5.611 GeV.

So, m0 c² is approximately 5.611 GeV.

Now, compute gamma*m0 c²:

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.611 ≈ Let me compute it accurately.

3.57142857 *5.611:

= 3 *5.611 =16.833.

0.57142857 *5.611.

Compute 0.5 *5.611=2.8055.

0.07142857 *5.611 ≈0.402.

So, 2.8055+0.402=3.2075.

Total E=16.833 +3.2075 =20.0405 GeV.

So, approximately 20.04 GeV.

But wait, the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher. So where is the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the rest mass. Maybe the problem expects the nucleus to be a deuteron (which isn't the case here; X is Li-6), but no, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass I used is wrong. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, checking online, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512166 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 931.494 MeV/c².

So, m0 c² for Li-6 is 6.01512166 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01512166 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.015 *931.494=13.9724 MeV, and 0.00012166 *931.494 ≈0.113 MeV.

Total: 13.9724 +0.113 ≈14.0854 MeV.

So, total m0 c² ≈5588.964 +14.0854 ≈5603.049 MeV =5.603049 GeV.

So, m0 c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, compute gamma times this: 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603.

Compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603 = approx 0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, 0.07142857 *0.603≈0.04307. So total≈0.35714285 +0.04307≈0.4002.

So, 2.8015 +0.4002=3.2017.

Total E=16.809 +3.2017=20.0107 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So, perhaps I missed something in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because earlier, I approximated sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, but let me check.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So, gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, no problem there.

Wait, maybe the rest mass I used is a bit off. Let me check the exact value.

Li-6 has an exact atomic mass of 6.01512166 amu. So, multiplying by 931.494 MeV/amu gives:

6.01512166 * 931.494 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01512166 *931.494 =0.01512166 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.00512166 *931.494 ≈approx 0.005*931.494=4.65747 MeV, and 0.00012166 *931.494≈0.113 MeV.

So, 9.31494 +4.65747 =13.97241, plus 0.113 ≈14.0854 MeV.

So, total is 5588.964 +14.0854=5603.0494 MeV →5.6030494 GeV.

So, m0 c²=5.6030494 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So, E_total =3.57142857 *5.6030494 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6030494:

Break it down:

3 *5.6030494=16.8091482.

0.57142857 *5.6030494.

Compute 0.5 *5.6030494 =2.8015247.

0.07142857 *5.6030494.

Compute 0.07 *5.6030494=0.392213458.

0.00142857 *5.6030494≈0.008000 (approx 0.00142857 *5.6030494=0.008000).

So, 0.392213458 +0.008000=0.400213458.

So, 2.8015247+0.400213458=3.201738158.

Adding to the 16.8091482 gives:

16.8091482 +3.201738158 =20.01088636 GeV.

So, approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of about 0.12 GeV. That's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, v =0.96c.

So, beta = v/c=0.96.

Beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta²)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Ah! Oh wait, that's possible. Because I was assuming the question wants the total energy, but perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

Let me reevaluate.

If E is the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma-1) m0 c².

So, K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6030494 GeV.

Gamma minus 1 is 2.57142857.

So, 2.57142857 *5.6030494 GeV.

Compute 2 *5.6030494 =11.2060988.

0.57142857 *5.6030494.

As before, 0.5 *5.6030494=2.8015247.

0.07142857 *5.6030494≈0.400213458.

Total for 0.57142857 part: 2.8015247 +0.400213458=3.201738158.

So, total K=11.2060988 +3.201738158=14.40783696 GeV.

So, about 14.4078 GeV of kinetic energy.

But the options don't have that. So, that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total energy.

Wait, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. I think in this context, the energy refers to the total energy, not the kinetic. Because the colliders usually state the energy as the total energy, but sometimes as kinetic.

Wait, but in the example, the LHC operates at about 6.5 TeV per proton, which is the total energy. But wait, no, the LHC's energy is the proton's kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) collides heavy ions. The energy per beam is typically expressed as the total energy. Or is it the kinetic energy? I'm not entirely certain, but perhaps the energy given in the question is the kinetic energy. Because in the options, the numbers are in the 20 GeV range, which seems reasonable for heavy ions.

Wait, but wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, which is a high gamma. So, the kinetic energy would be (gamma-1)*m0 c².

Earlier, I calculated that as approximately 14.4 GeV, but that doesn't match any of the options.

But the options are all in the 18-23 GeV range. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, the rest mass energy was 5.603 GeV. But perhaps the actual rest mass of Li-6 is higher? Because when I summed the individual nucleons, I got about 5.63 GeV.

Wait, wait another thought: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the rest mass should be 3*(proton mass) +3*(neutron mass) - binding energy.

The binding energy for light nuclei is relatively small compared to the rest mass of the nucleons, but let's compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just use the sum of the individual masses. Let's try that.

So, m0 c² =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) MeV.

Which is 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So, now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So, E =gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, and 0.07142857 *0.633511≈0.04545.

So, approx 0.35714285 +0.04545≈0.40259.

So, 0.57142857 part is 2.8167555 +0.40259≈3.21934.

Total E=16.900533 +3.21934≈20.11987 GeV≈20.12 GeV.

Which is very close to option C: 20.132 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just sum the individual nucleon masses. That would give m0 c²≈5.6335 GeV, leading to E≈20.12 GeV.

So, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

But why is there a small discrepancy? Let me compute it more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511=?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511= approximately 0.1197 (since 3.57142857 *0.03=0.107142857, and 3.57142857 *0.003511≈0.01254).

So, sum of 0.107142857 +0.01254≈0.11968.

So, total 2.142857142 +0.11968≈2.26253.

So, total E=17.85714285 +2.26253≈20.11967 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, the difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is about 12.3 MeV. That's probably due to more precise values for the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for the masses of the proton and neutron.

Proton mass:938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass:939.565 MeV/c².

So, 3*(938.272) =2814.816.

3*(939.565) =2818.695.

Sum:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511= let's compute it precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511:

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.633511.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511 = ?

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.1197 (as before).

So, sum is 2.142857142 +0.1197 =2.262557142.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.262557142=20.1197 GeV.

So, 20.1197 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV. So, a small difference.

But perhaps the problem uses more precise values. Let me check for more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

1-beta^2=1 -0.96^2=1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) using a calculator.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4.

sqrt(784e-4)=28e-2=0.28.

So, no change.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the kinetic energy, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, the options are in the 20 GeV range, which aligns with the total energy when using the sum of individual nucleon masses. So, the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I computed with the actual molar mass, I got about 20.01 GeV. So, perhaps the intended approach is to sum the individual masses, leading to option C.

Therefore, I'll select option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic mechanics. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is calculated by summing the rest mass energies of the individual nucleons, as the problem does not account for binding energy.

### Step 1: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and that of a neutron is approximately \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). For Li-6:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Relativistic Gamma Factor
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). The relativistic gamma factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.5714.
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy of the Nucleus
The total energy of the relativistic particle is:
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 = 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( 0.96c \) is best matched by option C.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me figure out what the nucleus is. Lithium usually has 3 protons because the atomic number for Li is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So, the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. So, I'm dealing with relativistic mechanics here. When particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. Instead, we have to use the relativistic formulas.

Wait, but let me think. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think that refers to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Or maybe it's the total energy? Hmm, sometimes in particle physics, the energy mentioned is the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". I remember that colliders typically accelerate particles to a certain energy, which is their kinetic energy, but sometimes it's given as the total energy. Hmm. I think for these types of problems, unless stated otherwise, we usually consider the kinetic energy as the value. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy.

Hmm, but wait, in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe it's the total energy (relativistic energy). Let me think. If the particle is moving at 0.96c, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the gamma factor will be substantial, so the total energy (gamma * m c²) will be much higher than the rest mass energy. So, if the question is asking for the energy, are they referring to the total energy or the kinetic energy?

Wait, the problem states, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, the energy given by the collider should be the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Wait, no—wait, no. Because the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, if the problem is asking for the energy delivered by the collider, perhaps it's the kinetic energy. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the energy refers to the total energy.

Wait, let me think about the standard approach for these problems. Normally, when someone asks for the energy of a particle accelerated in a collider, they're referring to the kinetic energy, unless stated otherwise. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy is asked. Hmm.

But the problem probably wants the kinetic energy, but I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy. Wait, let's think about the formulas.

The total energy E = gamma * m0 c². The kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So, if the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, then K = E - m0 c², so E = K + m0 c².

But in this problem, I'm given the speed, and need to find the energy. So, first, I'll compute gamma. Let's compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v is 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28 (since 0.28^2 = 0.0784). So, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Let's compute that.

Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, the mass of a neutron is a bit higher than a proton. Let me get the exact numbers.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So, each proton is about 938.3 MeV, and each neutron is about 939.57 MeV.

So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) MeV.

Calculating that:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total m0 c² = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, because each nucleon's mass contributes m c², so adding them gives the total rest energy.

Wait, but wait—wait, no. Because the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy. But wait, in this problem, are we supposed to ignore the binding energy and just take the sum? Because if the nucleus is moving, and we are considering its rest mass, then perhaps we should use the actual mass of the Li-6 isotope.

Wait, that's a point I wasn't considering. The rest mass of Li-6 isn't just 3 protons plus 3 neutrons because of the binding energy (mass deficit). So, I think it's better to look up the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate it as 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV. So, 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is about 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but I'm thinking that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given as the sum of the individual nucleons. Or maybe the problem assumes that the rest mass is approximately 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it accurately. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160 grams per mole. Wait, but that's the molar mass. To find the rest mass energy, I can use the conversion 1 u (atomic mass unit) is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So, the molar mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160 g/mol. Wait, but that's the molar mass, so the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is 6.0160 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number.

Wait, but I think that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to take the mass as the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, wait. Let's compute the rest energy of a Li-6 nucleus.

Each proton contributes about 938.272 MeV, each neutron about 939.565 MeV.

So, 3 protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total rest energy: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

But wait, that's the sum of the individual nucleons. The actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is less than that due to the mass defect (binding energy). So, the actual mass is about 6.0160 g/mol. Let me compute that.

Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.94 g/mol? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the atomic weight of Li is about 6.94 on the periodic table. But since Li-6 is an isotope, its atomic weight is approximately 6.016 for Li-6. Wait, perhaps I should double-check that.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.94, but that's an average of the isotopes. The specific isotope Li-6 has a molar mass of approximately 6.016 g/mol.

So, the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is (6.016 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number) per mole.

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 per mole.

So, the mass in grams per nucleus is 6.016 g/mol / 6.022e23 nuclei/mol.

Which is (6.016 / 6.022e23) grams.

Convert grams to kilograms: 6.016 / (6.022e23) ) * 1e-3 kg/g = 6.016e-3 / (6.022e23) kg.

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and perhaps I should use the atomic mass in MeV/c².

1 u (atomic mass unit) is 931.5 MeV/c².

So, Li-6 has a molar mass of 6.016 g/mol. Since 1 g is 1e-3 kg, and 1 mol is 6.022e23 atoms.

So, the mass per nucleus is (6.016 g/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) = (6.016e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) = 6.016e-3 / 6.022e23 kg/atom ≈ 9.99e-27 kg/atom.

Wait, but that's the mass in kilograms. To find the rest energy, we use E = mc².

So, E = 9.99e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute that:

(3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So, E = 9.99e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 8.991e-10 J.

Convert Joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E = 8.991e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.61e9 eV = 5.61 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 5.61 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I added the individual protons and neutrons, I got about 5.63 GeV. So, this is consistent. So the rest mass energy of Li-6 is about 5.61 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me cross-check. Let me compute the mass using the molar mass and atomic mass unit.

Molar mass of Li-6 is 6.016 g/mol.

So, the mass of one Li-6 atom is (6.016 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number) = 6.016e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈ 9.99e-27 kg.

Wait, but 6.016 grams per mole is 0.006016 kg/mol.

So, 0.006016 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = 0.006016 / 6.022e23 kg/atom ≈ 9.99e-27 kg/atom.

So, E = mc² = 9.99e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute that: 9.99e-27 * 9e16 = 8.991e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 8.991e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.61e9 eV = 5.61 GeV.

So, the rest energy is approximately 5.61 GeV.

Hmm, but earlier when I summed the individual protons and neutrons, I got 5.633 GeV. So, which is correct? Oh, because when you sum protons and neutrons, you get a higher value, but the actual nucleus has a lower mass due to binding energy (mass defect). So, the actual rest energy is about 5.61 GeV.

But perhaps in this problem, the intended approach is to use the sum of individual nucleons. Alternatively, since the exact mass isn't given, perhaps we are to use 6 nucleons, each with 938 MeV, giving 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

But wait, in reality, the actual rest mass is a bit less than that. So, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate it as 6 * 938 MeV. Let's proceed with that.

So, m0 c² = 5.628 GeV.

Now, gamma is approximately 3.5714 as calculated before.

So, the total energy E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.628:

3 * 5.628 = 16.884.

0.5714 *5.628 ≈ 3.216.

So, total E ≈ 16.884 + 3.216 = 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.628 = Let's compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857, 3.5714 *0.628 = ?

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.028 = 0.0999 (~0.1 approximately).

So, sum is 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 approximately, plus 0.0999 gives 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it precisely.

5.628 *3.5714.

5 *3.5714 = 17.857.

0.628 *3.5714 = ?

0.6 *3.5714 = 2.14284.

0.028 *3.5714 ≈ 0.099999.

So, 2.14284 + 0.099999 ≈ 2.24284.

So, total 17.857 + 2.24284 = 20.09984 GeV ≈ 20.10 GeV.

But wait, that's when using m0 c² =5.628 GeV.

But earlier, when using the actual molar mass, I got m0 c² =5.61 GeV. Let's see:

3.5714 *5.61 = ?

3 *5.61 =16.83.

0.5714 *5.61 = let's compute.

0.5 *5.61 =2.805.

0.0714 *5.61 ≈0.402.

So, 2.805 +0.402=3.207.

Total E=16.83 +3.207 = 20.037 GeV ≈20.04 GeV.

Hmm, but the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So, wait, if using m0 c² =5.628 GeV, the total energy is about 20.1 GeV. So, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.628.

3.5714 *5.628:

Breakdown:

=3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

Compute 0.5*5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628: 0.07 *5.628=0.394, 0.0014 *5.628≈0.00788. So sum is ~0.394+0.00788=0.40188.

So, 2.814 +0.40188=3.21588.

Total E=16.884 +3.21588=20.09988 GeV≈20.10 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, is there a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, let's recalculate gamma.

Because perhaps I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28, but let's compute it more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So, gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

So, that's correct.

So, the calculation is correct, giving E≈20.1 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps my approximation of m0 c² as 5.628 GeV is a bit off. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0160 grams per mole. So, molar mass=6.0160 g/mol.

Convert to kg/mol: 6.0160e-3 kg/mol.

Avogadro's number is 6.02214076e23 mol^-1.

So, mass per nucleus: (6.0160e-3 kg/mol) / (6.02214076e23 nuclei/mol) = (6.0160e-3) / (6.02214076e23) kg/nucleus.

Compute that:

6.0160e-3 /6.02214076e23 ≈ (6.0160 /6.02214076) *1e-26 kg.

6.0160/6.02214076 ≈0.999.

So, approximately 0.999e-26 kg.

Now, rest energy E = mc².

c=3e8 m/s.

So, E= (0.999e-26 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2.

= 0.999e-26 * 9e16 = 0.999 *9e-10 = 8.991e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV=1.60218e-19 J.

So, E = 8.991e-10 J /1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈5.611e9 eV =5.611 GeV.

So, m0 c² is approximately 5.611 GeV.

Now, compute gamma*m0 c²:

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.611 ≈ Let me compute it accurately.

3.57142857 *5.611:

= 3 *5.611 =16.833.

0.57142857 *5.611.

Compute 0.5 *5.611=2.8055.

0.07142857 *5.611 ≈0.402.

So, 2.8055+0.402=3.2075.

Total E=16.833 +3.2075 =20.0405 GeV.

So, approximately 20.04 GeV.

But wait, the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher. So where is the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the rest mass. Maybe the problem expects the nucleus to be a deuteron (which isn't the case here; X is Li-6), but no, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass I used is wrong. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, checking online, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512166 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 931.494 MeV/c².

So, m0 c² for Li-6 is 6.01512166 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01512166 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.015 *931.494=13.9724 MeV, and 0.00012166 *931.494 ≈0.113 MeV.

Total: 13.9724 +0.113 ≈14.0854 MeV.

So, total m0 c² ≈5588.964 +14.0854 ≈5603.049 MeV =5.603049 GeV.

So, m0 c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, compute gamma times this: 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603.

Compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603 = approx 0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, 0.07142857 *0.603≈0.04307. So total≈0.35714285 +0.04307≈0.4002.

So, 2.8015 +0.4002=3.2017.

Total E=16.809 +3.2017=20.0107 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So, perhaps I missed something in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because earlier, I approximated sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, but let me check.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So, gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, no problem there.

Wait, maybe the rest mass I used is a bit off. Let me check the exact value.

Li-6 has an exact atomic mass of 6.01512166 amu. So, multiplying by 931.494 MeV/amu gives:

6.01512166 * 931.494 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01512166 *931.494 =0.01512166 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.00512166 *931.494 ≈approx 0.005*931.494=4.65747 MeV, and 0.00012166 *931.494≈0.113 MeV.

So, 9.31494 +4.65747 =13.97241, plus 0.113 ≈14.0854 MeV.

So, total is 5588.964 +14.0854=5603.0494 MeV →5.6030494 GeV.

So, m0 c²=5.6030494 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So, E_total =3.57142857 *5.6030494 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6030494:

Break it down:

3 *5.6030494=16.8091482.

0.57142857 *5.6030494.

Compute 0.5 *5.6030494 =2.8015247.

0.07142857 *5.6030494.

Compute 0.07 *5.6030494=0.392213458.

0.00142857 *5.6030494≈0.008000 (approx 0.00142857 *5.6030494=0.008000).

So, 0.392213458 +0.008000=0.400213458.

So, 2.8015247+0.400213458=3.201738158.

Adding to the 16.8091482 gives:

16.8091482 +3.201738158 =20.01088636 GeV.

So, approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of about 0.12 GeV. That's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, v =0.96c.

So, beta = v/c=0.96.

Beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta²)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Ah! Oh wait, that's possible. Because I was assuming the question wants the total energy, but perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

Let me reevaluate.

If E is the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma-1) m0 c².

So, K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6030494 GeV.

Gamma minus 1 is 2.57142857.

So, 2.57142857 *5.6030494 GeV.

Compute 2 *5.6030494 =11.2060988.

0.57142857 *5.6030494.

As before, 0.5 *5.6030494=2.8015247.

0.07142857 *5.6030494≈0.400213458.

Total for 0.57142857 part: 2.8015247 +0.400213458=3.201738158.

So, total K=11.2060988 +3.201738158=14.40783696 GeV.

So, about 14.4078 GeV of kinetic energy.

But the options don't have that. So, that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total energy.

Wait, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. I think in this context, the energy refers to the total energy, not the kinetic. Because the colliders usually state the energy as the total energy, but sometimes as kinetic.

Wait, but in the example, the LHC operates at about 6.5 TeV per proton, which is the total energy. But wait, no, the LHC's energy is the proton's kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) collides heavy ions. The energy per beam is typically expressed as the total energy. Or is it the kinetic energy? I'm not entirely certain, but perhaps the energy given in the question is the kinetic energy. Because in the options, the numbers are in the 20 GeV range, which seems reasonable for heavy ions.

Wait, but wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, which is a high gamma. So, the kinetic energy would be (gamma-1)*m0 c².

Earlier, I calculated that as approximately 14.4 GeV, but that doesn't match any of the options.

But the options are all in the 18-23 GeV range. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, the rest mass energy was 5.603 GeV. But perhaps the actual rest mass of Li-6 is higher? Because when I summed the individual nucleons, I got about 5.63 GeV.

Wait, wait another thought: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the rest mass should be 3*(proton mass) +3*(neutron mass) - binding energy.

The binding energy for light nuclei is relatively small compared to the rest mass of the nucleons, but let's compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just use the sum of the individual masses. Let's try that.

So, m0 c² =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) MeV.

Which is 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So, now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So, E =gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, and 0.07142857 *0.633511≈0.04545.

So, approx 0.35714285 +0.04545≈0.40259.

So, 0.57142857 part is 2.8167555 +0.40259≈3.21934.

Total E=16.900533 +3.21934≈20.11987 GeV≈20.12 GeV.

Which is very close to option C: 20.132 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just sum the individual nucleon masses. That would give m0 c²≈5.6335 GeV, leading to E≈20.12 GeV.

So, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

But why is there a small discrepancy? Let me compute it more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511=?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511= approximately 0.1197 (since 3.57142857 *0.03=0.107142857, and 3.57142857 *0.003511≈0.01254).

So, sum of 0.107142857 +0.01254≈0.11968.

So, total 2.142857142 +0.11968≈2.26253.

So, total E=17.85714285 +2.26253≈20.11967 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, the difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is about 12.3 MeV. That's probably due to more precise values for the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for the masses of the proton and neutron.

Proton mass:938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass:939.565 MeV/c².

So, 3*(938.272) =2814.816.

3*(939.565) =2818.695.

Sum:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511= let's compute it precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511:

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.633511.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511 = ?

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.1197 (as before).

So, sum is 2.142857142 +0.1197 =2.262557142.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.262557142=20.1197 GeV.

So, 20.1197 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV. So, a small difference.

But perhaps the problem uses more precise values. Let me check for more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

1-beta^2=1 -0.96^2=1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) using a calculator.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4.

sqrt(784e-4)=28e-2=0.28.

So, no change.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the kinetic energy, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, the options are in the 20 GeV range, which aligns with the total energy when using the sum of individual nucleon masses. So, the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I computed with the actual molar mass, I got about 20.01 GeV. So, perhaps the intended approach is to sum the individual masses, leading to option C.

Therefore, I'll select option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic mechanics. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is calculated by summing the rest mass energies of the individual nucleons, as the problem does not account for binding energy.

### Step 1: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and that of a neutron is approximately \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). For Li-6:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Relativistic Gamma Factor
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). The relativistic gamma factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.5714.
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy of the Nucleus
The total energy of the relativistic particle is:
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 = 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( 0.96c \) is best matched by option C.

**Answer: C**
