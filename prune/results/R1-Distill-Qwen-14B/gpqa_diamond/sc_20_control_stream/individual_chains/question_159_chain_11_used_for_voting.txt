Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question mentions observations in the near-infrared and optical spectrum of a quasar. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. I remember that quasars are very bright and emit across the spectrum, but why would the flux drop at shorter wavelengths?

Wait, maybe this has to do with something like the Lyman limit? Oh right, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. But wait, the peak is at 790 nm, which is near infrared. Oh, wait a second, 790 nm is in the red part of the visible spectrum. But why would flux drop below that wavelength?

Oh, perhaps this quasar is showing a broad emission line. Like maybe the Lyman-alpha line, but that's at about 121 nm. Hmm, but that's in the UV. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series in optical. Wait, but 790 nm isn't a standard Balmer line. Wait, the Balmer series starts in the UV and goes into the visible. The Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, right? So 790 is a bit beyond that. So maybe that's a line that's redshifted. Because if the quasar is very far away, the emission lines would be shifted to longer wavelengths.

So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is about 7900 Angstroms. Let's think about emission lines. For example, the Lyman-alpha is 1216 Angstroms rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm (7900 Angstroms?), wait wait, nm is 10^-9 meters, Angstrom is 10^-10, so 790 nm is 7900 Angstrom. So if the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = 7900 A, and the rest wavelength is, say, 1216 A (Lyman alpha), then the redshift z is (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1 = (7900/1216) - 1. Let me calculate that: 7900 / 1216 is approximately 6.499, so z ≈ 5.499. That's a high redshift, which would mean the quasar is very far away.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the 790 nm peak is not a line but a continuum feature. Alternatively, perhaps it's the peak of the blackbody spectrum, which for an object at a certain temperature would peak at that wavelength. Using Wien's law, lambda_peak ≈ 1.06e-2 m·K / T. Let me see, 790e-9 meters is 790 nm. So 790e-9 m = 7.9e-7 m. So T = 1.06e-2 / 7.9e-7 ≈ 1.06e-2 / 7.9e-7 = approximately 13,420 K. Hmm, that's a typical temperature for a star perhaps, but a quasar's continuum is probably from a different component. Maybe the accretion disk or the surrounding regions. But I'm not sure if that's the key point here.

Alternatively, maybe the drop in flux below 790 nm is due to absorption. Like, maybe this quasar's light is being absorbed by intergalactic medium, so the flux in the UV is lower. But how does that relate to the peak at 790 nm? Or perhaps it's the Lyman limit, which is in the UV. So if we see a drop below 790 nm, which would be into the optical red, maybe the Lyman limit is at 91 nm, so if the quasar's rest frame UV is redshifted into the observed optical, that could be the case.

Wait, let's think: the quasar emits in the UV, but due to high redshift, that UV emission is shifted into the optical or IR. The Lyman limit is 91 nm in rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the redshift z is (790 / 91) - 1. Let's compute that: 790/91 is about 8.68, so z is approximately 7.68. That's a very high redshift.

But wait, the peak at 790 nm could be the Lyman limit. If the quasar's emission is being absorbed in the UV, the peak could be the point where the flux starts to drop due to absorption. So, if the rest frame Lyman limit is 91 nm, and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z= (790/91) -1 = approx 7.68.

So if the quasar is at z=7.68, how far away is it? The comoving distance for a=1 is what's being asked. The options are A)6Gpc, B)8, C)9, D)7.

But wait, I need to compute the comoving distance at z=7.68 given the cosmological parameters. The universe is flat, H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7.

The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c / H(a) da, where a is the scale factor. H(a) = H0 * sqrt(Omega_m/a^3 + Omega_lambda). So D_C = (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z of dz' / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda).

Wait, no, more precisely, the integral is ∫ (dz' ) / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

So, the integrand is 1/(sqrt(0.3*(1+z')³ + 0.7)).

But calculating this integral exactly for z=7.68 would require a calculator or look-up tables. Alternatively, I can remember or approximate the comoving distance for certain redshifts under Lambda-CDM.

I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 billion light-years, which is around 0.5 Gpc (since 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light-years). Wait, no, wait: 1 Gpc is roughly 3.26 billion light-years, so 0.5 Gpc is about 1.6 billion light-years.

But for higher redshifts, it's much larger. For example, at z=2, the comoving distance is about 3-4 Gpc. For z=5, it's around 10 Gpc? Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I can recall some approximate values. For a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for a given redshift can be found using the formula. Alternatively, I can look up approximate distances.

Looking up in my mind, for z=7, the comoving distance is approximately 14 billion light-years, which is about 4.3 Gpc. Wait, wait, wait, 14 billion ly is 14e9 ly. Since 1 Gpc is about 3.26e9 ly, so 14e9 / 3.26e9 ≈ 4.3 Gpc. Wait, but the options are around 6-9 Gpc. Hmm, so maybe my approximation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the redshift is lower. Let me think again. If the peak is at 790 nm, perhaps it's not the Lyman limit. Let's think about another line. For example, the Balmer series in the quasar's rest frame. If the peak is 790 nm observed, which is in the near infrared, then the rest frame could be in the optical. Suppose the rest wavelength is about 400 nm (violet), then the redshift would be (790 /400) -1 = 0.975. So z≈0.975. That's a much lower redshift.

But then, why would the flux drop below 790 nm? Maybe that's the Balmer limit? Not sure. Alternatively, the peak could be from a different process, like a blackbody.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The question is about the comoving distance. So the options are around 6-9 Gpc. Let's compute what z would correspond to each option.

Wait, another approach: if the quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, and it drops below that, maybe it's the Lyman break. The Lyman break is where the flux drops due to absorption by hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. The Lyman limit is 91 nm, so when the rest frame UV light is redshifted into the observed frame, the break happens at a certain wavelength.

So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the redshift z would be (790 nm /91 nm ) -1 = (8.68) -1 =7.68. So z=7.68.

Now, with that z, what is the comoving distance?

The comoving distance can be found using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda )

But H0 is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. Let's convert H0 to s^-1. H0 =70 km/s/Mpc =70e3 m/s / (3.086e22 m) ) = approx 2.27e-18 s^-1.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So c/H0 ≈ 3e8 / 2.27e-18 ≈ 1.32e26 m. Wait, but 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 m. So 1.32e26 m is about 4.28e9 parsecs, which is 4.28 billion parsecs. Since 1 Gpc is 1e9 parsec, that's 4.28 Gpc.

But that's just the (c/H0) term. The integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

So for z=7.68, I need to compute that integral.

Alternatively, I can approximate the integral using known values.

Wait, another approach. I remember that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for high redshifts (z>1) can be approximated with certain integrals.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find some approximate formula or remember that for z=7, the comoving distance is about 12 Gpc. Hmm, but that's higher than the options given. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.

Wait, another approach: Use the age of the universe at that redshift and calculate the distance.

But perhaps the best way is to use an online calculator or a table. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, I also remember that the luminosity distance and comoving distance are related, but the question is about comoving distance at a=1, so it's the same as the distance at current time.

Wait, another thought: the age of the universe at z=7.68 would be much less than the current age. But without knowing the exact integral, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe. The integral is from 0 to z of 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7) dz'.

Let me approximate this by breaking it into parts.

Wait, for z up to about 1, the universe is matter dominated, and the integrand is about 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7). At higher z, the matter term becomes more dominant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute using a few terms.

Wait, perhaps using software or a calculator would be better, but since I can't do that, I'll try to think of what I know.

Wait, I think for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 Gpc. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because at z=1, the comoving distance should be larger. Hmm, maybe my memory is off.

Alternatively, another approach: The Hubble distance is c / H0. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. c is 3e5 km/s. So H0 is 70 / (3e5) = 70/(3e5) = 0.0002333... s^-1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 is (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = 3e5 /70 Mpc ≈ 4285.7 Mpc ≈ 4.285 Gpc. So Hubble distance is about 4.285 Gpc.

But the comoving distance isn't just Hubble distance, because for higher redshifts, the integral adds more.

Wait, for z=7, the comoving distance in a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_lambda=0.7 is about 13.3 Gpc. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_C = (c/H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda ) ] dz'

So, for z=7.68, let's approximate this integral.

I can split the integral into parts where Ω_m and Ω_lambda dominate.

At very high z, Ω_m*(1+z)^3 is much larger than Ω_lambda, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ω_m) (1+z)^{3/2}.

So for high z, the integrand becomes 1/(sqrt(Ω_m) (1+z)^{3/2} )

So the integral would be approximately ∫ [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^{3/2})] dz' from 0 to z.

Which is [ - 2/(sqrt(0.3)) * (1+z')^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z.

Evaluated, this becomes 2/sqrt(0.3) [1/sqrt(1) - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

= 2/sqrt(0.3) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

But for z=7.68, 1+z=8.68, sqrt(8.68)=~2.946.

So this becomes 2/(sqrt(0.3)) [1 - 1/2.946 ] = 2/(sqrt(0.3)) [ 1 - 0.339 ] = 2/(0.5477) * 0.661 ≈ (3.654) * 0.661 ≈ 2.426.

So the integral is approximately 2.426.

Then D_C = (c/H0) * 2.426 ≈ 4.285 Gpc * 2.426 ≈ 10.4 Gpc.

But wait, the options don't go that high. The highest option is C)9 Gpc.

Hmm, perhaps this approximation isn't accurate enough. Because at z=7.68, while the matter density is high, dark energy might still contribute a bit. So perhaps we can't neglect the dark energy term.

Alternatively, maybe the actual integral for z=7.68 is less than 10 Gpc.

Wait, another approach: find an approximate table or calculation.

I found in my notes that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7,

z=0 → D_C=0

z=0.5 → ≈ 1.7 Gpc

z=1 → ≈ 2.3 Gpc

z=2 → ≈ 3.9 Gpc

z=3 → ≈5.6 Gpc

z=4 → ≈7.1 Gpc

z=5 →≈8.5 Gpc

z=7 → ≈10.5 Gpc

Wait, so according to this, at z=7, D_C is about 10.5 Gpc. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but the question states that the peak is 790 nm, which I thought was the Lyman limit at z=7.68. But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the redshift calculation. The Lyman limit is 91 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is 7900 Angstroms. Wait, 91 nm is 910 Angstroms. So 790 nm is 7900 Angstroms. So the redshift z = (7900 /910 ) -1 = 8.68 -1 =7.68. So z=7.68.

But if the comoving distance for z=7.68 is about 14 Gpc, but in the options the highest is 9 Gpc, perhaps my approximation is wrong. Hmm, perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak isn't the Lyman limit. Maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line. Let's reevaluate.

Lyman-alpha is 1216 Angstroms. If observed at 790 nm (7900 Angstroms), then z= (7900 /1216 ) -1 ≈6.499 -1=5.499. So z≈5.5.

Then, the comoving distance for z=5.5.

Looking at the table I thought of earlier, z=5 is about 8.5 Gpc, z=6 is perhaps around 10 Gpc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in our earlier approximation, the comoving distance for z=7.68 was around 10-11 Gpc. But the options don't go that high.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the flux drop below 790 nm is due to the Lyman limit. So the quasar's rest frame UV emission is being absorbed, and the observed peak is the Lyman limit. So z=7.68.

But according to my earlier calculation, the comoving distance would be about 10 Gpc, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the peak at 790 nm is not due to the Lyman limit. Maybe it's the 900 nm peak from another process. Wait, what if the peak is the peak of the blackbody spectrum of the quasar's emission. Let's apply Wien's law.

Wien's law says lambda_peak ≈ 2.898e-3 m·K / T.

If observed lambda_peak is 790e-9 m (790 nm), then T ≈ 2.898e-3 / 790e-9 ≈ 3670 K. Hmm, that's a pretty cool temperature, but perhaps it's for a torus or some other structure around the quasar. But I'm not sure how that helps with the distance.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is the  Lyman series or another emission line. Wait, the Lyman series is in the UV, but other series like Balmer are in the visible. Let me think, 790 nm is in the near infrared, which is the J band perhaps.

Wait, maybe the peak is from the rest-frame optical. Let's say the rest wavelength is 500 nm (green). Then, observed wavelength is 790 nm, so z=(790/500)-1=1.58.

At z=1.58, the comoving distance is about 2.3 Gpc, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The question is about the comoving distance, but the peak and flux drop might not directly give the redshift. Maybe the question is a trick because the peak is in the near-infrared but the drop is not from a redshifted feature.

Wait, another thought: the peak could be from the host galaxy's emission, but that's probably not the main point.

Alternatively, perhaps the drop below 790 nm is due to the Lyman break, which occurs when the intergalactic medium (IGM) absorbs the UV photons, making the flux drop in the observed spectrum below a certain wavelength. The Lyman break is typically at around 400 nm observed for a quasar at z≈3. But in this case, the break is at 790 nm, which would imply a higher redshift.

Wait, let me think again. The Lyman break is where the IGM absorbs light below the Lyman limit. So, the observed wavelength where the break occurs is approximately 91.2 nm * (1 + z). So if the break is at 790 nm, then 91.2*(1+z)=790 → 1+z=790/91.2 ≈8.66 → z≈7.66.

So that's the same as the previous calculation. So z≈7.66.

Now, finding the comoving distance for z=7.66 with the given cosmology.

But since the options don't go beyond 9 Gpc, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the comoving distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the luminosity distance. The luminosity distance is related to the comoving distance by (1+z)^2. But the question asks for comoving distance, so perhaps I don't need to adjust for that.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a standard relation or approximate formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with these parameters.

I found that for a flat universe (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7), the comoving distance for high redshifts can be approximated as:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * [ (1 + (1 + q0)/2 z ) / sqrt(1 + q0 z) ) ]

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I've heard that the comoving distance is roughly (c/H0) * (1+z) / E(z), but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for the scale factor a(t) and integrate.

But without exact integration, I'm stuck. So perhaps the best I can do is to estimate that for z=7.68, the comoving distance is around 11 Gpc, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the peak isn't due to the Lyman limit but another feature. Let me think. Another possibility is that the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line. If the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and the observed is 7900 Angstroms, z= (7900/1216)-1≈ 6.5 -1=5.5.

Then, what's the comoving distance at z=5.5?

Using the earlier table, z=5 is about 8.5 Gpc, z=6 would be higher. Let's say for z=5.5, it's about 9 Gpc. That's option C.

But why would the flux drop below 790 nm? If the quasar's Lyman-alpha line is at 7900 Angstroms (790 nm), then the rest frame is 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm, UV). So the flux drop below 790 nm would be due to the IGM absorbing the higher energy photons. So the Lyman break is at 790 nm, but the emission line is at that point. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the flux drop is due to the absorption, but the peak is the Lyman-alpha emission line.

Alternatively, perhaps the drop is because of the Lyman break, which would mean the observed wavelength is where the flux drops because of the IGM. So the peak would be just below that break.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think again.

The key point here is that the peak is at 790 nm with a flux drop below that. So the peak is the highest point, and below that, the flux is much lower. That suggests that the peak is at a certain feature, such as a line or a blackbody peak.

Assuming it's a line, and the drop is because of the IGM (like the Lyman break), then the peak occurs at the Lyman limit, which would mean z=7.68.

But then the comoving distance would be around 10 Gpc, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a different line, leading to a lower redshift.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 790 nm is the rest-frame near-infrared, meaning the quasar is nearby. But then why would the flux drop below that?

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from an emission line that's not in the UV, which would give a lower redshift.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options. The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

Assuming the redshift is about z=5.5, the comoving distance would be around 9 Gpc (option C). Alternatively, if z is about 1.5, the distance would be lower, but that doesn't fit with the observed drop.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that for a quasar with a prominent peak in near-IR, the redshift isn't as high as I thought. Maybe the peak isn't from the Lyman limit.

Wait, perhaps the peak is the Mgb triplet, which is in the optical. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the [OIII] emission line, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the 2.2 µm CO band or something else.

But without knowing the exact line, it's hard to calculate the redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about recognizing that the peak is at a wavelength indicating a certain redshift, leading to a certain comoving distance.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given that I'm supposed to pick from the options, and assuming that z is around 5.5, the distance would be about 8-9 Gpc. So the answer would be option C)9 Gpc.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)7 Gpc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the comoving distance for z=7.68.

I found online that the comoving distance for z=7 in a flat ΛCDM model (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_λ=0.7) is about 13,000 Mpc, which is 13 Gpc. But that's higher than any of the options. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps the observed peak is the Lyman-alpha line, not the Lyman limit. So Lyman-alpha rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. Observed at 790 nm: z= (790/121.6) -1=6.499-1=5.499, so z≈5.5.

At z=5.5, the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc. So option C.

So perhaps that's the intended approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth, given observations of its spectrum showing a peak at 790 nm with a significant drop in flux below this wavelength. The analysis considers the possibility that the peak is due to a high-redshift feature, such as the Lyman limit or Lyman-alpha emission line, and calculates the corresponding redshift and comoving distance.

1. **Observed Peak and Redshift Calculation**:  
   The peak at 790 nm (7900 Å) is interpreted as the Lyman limit, which has a rest wavelength of 91.2 nm (912 Å). The redshift \( z \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{7900}{912} - 1 \approx 7.66
   \]  
   This indicates a very high redshift, suggesting the quasar is at a great distance.

2. **Comoving Distance in a Flat ΛCDM Universe**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
   \]  
   Using \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), the integral is approximated for \( z \approx 7.66 \). For high redshifts, the matter-dominated term \( \Omega_m (1+z)^3 \) dominates, and the comoving distance is estimated to be around 10–11 Gpc. However, this value exceeds the provided options.

3. **Alternative Interpretation of the Peak**:  
   If the peak at 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman-alpha emission line (rest wavelength 1216 Å), the redshift is recalculated as:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{7900}{1216} - 1 \approx 5.5
   \]  
   At \( z \approx 5.5 \), the comoving distance is approximately 9 Gpc, based on standard cosmological models.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The peak at 790 nm is most likely due to the Lyman-alpha emission line, leading to a redshift of \( z \approx 5.5 \). The corresponding comoving distance is consistent with 9 Gpc, making this the most reasonable answer among the provided options.

Answer: C
