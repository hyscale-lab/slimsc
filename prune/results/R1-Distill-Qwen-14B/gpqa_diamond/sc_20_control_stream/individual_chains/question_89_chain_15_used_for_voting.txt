Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. Wait, but in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh wait, wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Hmm, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four-membered rings. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite ends, perhaps. So when KOH is added, would this cause elimination? But wait, elimination usually requires adjacent halogens. Wait, 1,3 are not adjacent. So maybe I'm thinking of the wrong reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, in that case, the two bromines would need to be adjacent. Oh, but 1,3 are not adjacent. Hmm. So perhaps another reaction is happening here. Wait, KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, what if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? But wait, 1 and 3 are two apart. So maybe the structure of adamantane is such that 1 and 3 are adjacent. Wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a diamond structure. Let me think: the structure of adamantane is four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons in a chair-like structure perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is heated with a dihalide, it's a substitution reaction. But substitution with what? Wait, KOH is a base, so maybe it's an elimination.

Wait, let me think again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a product. The product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) which is probably an -OH group or an ether or something else. But wait, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone. Because 1720 is indicative of a ketone. So that suggests oxidation. Wait, but how does that happen from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reaction wrong. Let me think: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with KOH, they eliminate to form an alkene. But in this case, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but I thought 1,3 were not adjacent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure, even though they are numbered 1 and 3. Maybe in the adamantane structure, carbons 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3 is adjacent to 2, so 1 and 3 are on opposite sides but not adjacent. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. But wait, an epoxide would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring. But the product here has a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an epoxide.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH heating is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids could be things like ketones or maybe epoxides, but more likely a ketone. So, reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could be forming an alkene via elimination, but then maybe that alkene is further reacting. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other process.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms an alkene, which then perhaps undergoes some oxidation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step forms an epoxide, which upon further reaction becomes a ketone. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that would require a different mechanism.

Wait, let's think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm peak for 2H. That's a downfield shift, possibly for an -OH group, but could also be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but 4.79 is more in line with an -OH, but the integration is 2H. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Or perhaps it's a ketone adjacent to some CH2 groups.

Wait, the IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So the product is a ketone. That suggests that the starting material went through an oxidation to form a ketone. So, but how? How does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, the OH- could deprotonate a neighboring H, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond. Wait, but then how do you form a ketone from that?

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, the two Brs leave, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbene or something? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and then further oxidation, but under what conditions? Wait, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is forming an epoxide. No, because in the NMR, if it were an epoxide, the protons on the oxygen would be around 3-4 ppm, but the 4.79 is higher, maybe indicating something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense, as the initial molecule is 1,3-dibromo.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group. But if that were the case, the product would be 1,3-dihydroxyl adamantane. Then, that would have two -OH groups. But the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. So maybe each -OH is split into a CH2OH group? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each substitution would be on a different carbon.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is being converted into a diol, but the structure after substitution might have two OH groups adjacent, but then the NMR would show two sets of peaks. Alternatively, maybe the diol is further oxidized into a ketone. Wait, that's possible. But under what conditions? KOH is a strong base but not an oxidizer. Unless it's a peroxide, but the question says KOH is used. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is subjected to a Hofmann elimination? No, that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then further oxidation to form a ketone. Wait, but how would the alkene form a ketone under KOH conditions? Typically, you'd need an oxidizing agent for that. Unless the elimination leads to a conjugated diene or something that can undergo some kind of cyclization.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this first step. Let's think about the product's description. It's a light yellow solid, which is a bit vague. The NMR data includes 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Then the 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests a lot of CH2 or CH groups in a more shielded environment. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But the IR is only showing one carbonyl peak, so maybe a single ketone. Alternatively, it could be a diol that's been oxidized to a ketone. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative? No, that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the next step. The product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride or something that can act as an acylating agent. Wait, but product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Hmm, but KOH is a strong base, not a good nucleophile for acyl chlorides.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and upon treatment with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of cyclization or elimination. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, I'm going to try to think about the possible structures. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then product 2 is formed by heating with Al(i-Pr)3. That could lead to a Friedel-Crafts type reaction if product 1 is an acyl chloride. But product 1 isn't an acyl chloride because it's formed from KOH, which is a base, not something that would form an acyl chloride.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, maybe undergoes elimination to form a double bond. Wait, but for elimination, the two bromines would need to be on adjacent carbons. Oh wait, in adamantane, perhaps the carbons 1 and 3 are adjacent because of the structure. Maybe in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond-like structure, so 1 and 3 could be connected through a bridge. So, perhaps when KOH is added, they eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. That would make product 1 an alkene.

But then, where's the carbonyl coming from? Unless the alkene is further oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some oxidation to form a ketone? No, that doesn't fit with the conditions.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diepoxide. No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent for that. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed via elimination. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution reaction, where each bromide is replaced by hydroxide, forming a diol. If the diol is then treated with a strong acid, perhaps it can form a ketone via pinacol rearrangement. But the first step was with KOH, a base, not an acid.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look up some similar reactions. Oh, wait, I'm just trying to think it through. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, loses two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. But if that's the case, product 1 would be an alkene. Then, what's the IR of an alkene? It would show a C=C peak around 1650 cm-1, but the IR here is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So maybe elimination isn't the reaction.

Wait, what if the reaction is an SN2 substitution? But with two bromines, that would require two SN2 reactions, which would form a diol, 1,3-diol. Then, perhaps the diol is oxidized to a ketone. But under what conditions? KOH would not oxidize, but perhaps the diol is further treated with an oxidizing agent. Wait, but the problem says KOH is used, so maybe the diol isn't the product. Alternatively, maybe the diol is heated with KOH, causing some elimination.

Wait, maybe the diol undergoes dehydration to form a ketone. That would require the diol to have adjacent hydroxyl groups. Wait, if the diol is 1,3-butanediol, upon heating with acid, it can form a ketone via the pinacol rearrangement. But again, KOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is 1,2-diol, which upon elimination would form a carbonyl. Wait, but 1,3-diol can't form a carbonyl via simple elimination. So perhaps the initial product is a diol, and then under certain conditions, it undergoes a rearrangement.

But I think I'm getting too stuck on the first step. Let me try to outline what each step might be doing.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1 (light yellow solid, IR has C=O, so ketone or ester, but more likely ketone).

Step 2: Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → Product 2.

Step 3: Product 2 + ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide → Product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H.

So, let me think about each step.

Step 1: Maybe the heating with KOH converts the dihalide into a ketone. How? Maybe via elimination followed by some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but I thought they were 1 and 3. Maybe in adamantane, 1 and 3 are actually adjacent because of the structure. Let me try to visualize adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, each carbon connected to two others in a tetrahedral arrangement. So perhaps 1 and 3 are adjacent. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So, when KOH is added, they undergo dehydrohalogenation (elimination), forming a double bond. So product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

But then, how does the IR have a C=O peak? Because if it's an alkene, the IR would show a C=C peak. So I'm getting a contradiction here.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Perhaps 1 and 3 are not adjacent but are on the same face, leading to a possibility of some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but if KOH is a base, substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is. But substitution would replace each Br with an -OH, forming a diol. Then, perhaps the diol is oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So, perhaps after substitution to form the diol, another step is needed. But the problem only says KOH is used, so maybe the diol is further treated. Hmm, but the product is a single compound, so maybe the diol is unstable and further reacts.

Wait, maybe the diol eliminates to form a ketone. For that, the diol would have to be a vicinal diol (1,2-diol), which upon elimination forms a ketone. But 1,3-diol can't eliminate to form a ketone. So perhaps the substitution forms a 1,2-diol, which then eliminates to form a ketone.

But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If substitution occurs, each Br is replaced by -OH. So, 1 and 3 would both have -OH groups. But then, for elimination, the -OHs need to be on adjacent carbons. So, if the diol is 1,2-diol, elimination would form a carbonyl. But in this case, the diol would be 1,3, which isn't adjacent, so elimination isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps substitution isn't the right pathway.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong reaction. Let's consider that the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, forming a triple bond? No, that would require two adjacent dihalides, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a single elimination, forming a bromide and a double bond. Wait, but that would require only one Br to leave, which doesn't make sense because KOH is in excess.

Wait, maybe each Br leaves, but in a concerted manner, forming a carbocation or something. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that requires aryl halides, which I don't think is the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find another approach. The product after KOH has a C=O group, as per the IR. So, perhaps the initial reaction is an oxidation of a dihalide to a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to the formation of an epoxide, which then undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening to form a ketone. But again, the conditions here are KOH, a base, not acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a geminal diol. But that requires two OH groups on the same carbon. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on different carbons, so substitution would give two OHs on different carbons, making a vicinal diol or 1,3-diol, which doesn't form a gem diol.

Wait, maybe the diol undergoes some kind of dehydration. For example, in the case of 1,2-diol, heating with acid can form an alkene. But with 1,3-diol, perhaps it's possible to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is oxidized to a ketone. But again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structure of product 1. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, perhaps. Could that be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester? Or maybe an alcohol.

Wait, the product after KOH is a solid, which could be something like a dialkyl ether, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Ester carbonyls are around 1740, ketones around 1715. So, this is near a ketone. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → ketone.

But how? Let me think about oxidative cleavage. Oxidative cleavage of a dihalide would require something like ozonolysis, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to elimination and then some kind of keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a ring contraction, releasing HBr and forming a ketone.

Wait, here's another angle: adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so when two bromines are eliminated, perhaps a bridge is broken, leading to a carbonyl group. For example, elimination of two HBr from adjacent carbons could form a carbonyl. Wait, that might make sense.

Wait, in some structures, when adjacent dihalides undergo elimination, they form a double bond. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl, like in a ring contraction, perhaps that's what's happening.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is part of a bicyclic structure, and elimination leads to a smaller ring with a carbonyl. This is getting a bit abstract, but perhaps that's the case.

Assuming that product 1 is a ketone, let's move on to step 2.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the ketone itself can't undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation because the carbonyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a benzene ring with a ketone group, but that's not the case here because the starting material is adamantane-based.

Wait, perhaps product 1 has an alkyl group that can undergo a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, but that's unlikely because KOH is a base, and it would hydrolyze acyl chlorides to ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and the Lewis acid is facilitating some kind of elimination or substitution. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might not do much, unless it's part of some kind of enolate chemistry. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Lewis acid is causing ring opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid is causing it to form a cyclic ether or something else. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, I think I'm not getting much further on step 2. Let's proceed to step 3, maybe it will give me some clues.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. The reaction is typically done at low temperatures (-78°C) to prevent over-reaction. Ozone cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups.

After ozonolysis, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is added. DMS is a reductive workup agent; it prevents the formation of ozonides and reduces any ozonide intermediates to aldehydes or ketones.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded hydrogens are usually those in the most electron-deficient areas, like near carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, and product 3 has carbonyl groups, perhaps the structure of product 3 has some symmetry or groups that lead to a particular coupling pattern.

Let me try to put it all together. Maybe the overall reaction sequence is:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (a ketone) → (Al(i-Pr)3, heat) → product 2 (perhaps an alkene) → (ozone, DMS) → product 3 (with carbonyl groups).

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an alkene formed via some acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps elimination. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon heating with Al(i-Pr)3 becomes an alkene. Wait, but how? Aluminum isopropoxide is more of a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts, not for opening epoxides.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, undergoes elimination to form an alkene. That makes sense. So, if product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 (which can act as a dehydrating agent) would eliminate H2O, forming an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, let's piece it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → 1,3-diol (product 1).

Step 2: 1,3-diol + Al(i-Pr)3 → elimination of water, forming an alkene (product 2).

Step 3: Alkene (product 2) undergoes ozonolysis → cleavage into carbonyl-containing product (product 3).

But how does the diol (product 1) become an alkene (product 2)? Well, if the diol is a 1,2-diol, elimination would form an alkene. But if it's a 1,3-diol, elimination isn't possible because the hydroxyl groups aren't adjacent. So, perhaps product 1 is a 1,2-diol, which upon elimination forms an alkene.

Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so substitution would give a 1,3-diol, which can't eliminate. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the initial reaction isn't substitution but elimination.

Wait, let's get back. Maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone. How? If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. That would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons, which in adamantane, perhaps they are.

Assuming that, product 1 would be a ketone, such as adamantanone.

Then, step 2: product 1 (adamantanone) is treated with Al(i-Pr)3. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an acyl chloride, but product 1 is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe Al(i-Pr)3 is used to form an enol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(i-Pr)3 is causing ring-opening to form a diol. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, and step 2 does something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bromoalkane, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the possible product after ozonolysis.

Product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks it into two carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl group. Its coupling pattern would depend on adjacent hydrogens.

So, for example, if the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH2 group, it could be a triplet or a doublet, depending on splitting.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. If product 2 is a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would form two ketones. Alternatively, if it's a cis-alkene, the products would differ, but the splitting pattern would depend on the neighboring groups.

But wait, when the alkene is ozonolyzed, the resulting carbonyl groups are adjacent to the original substituents. So, if the double bond was between carbons A and B, each with substituents, then after ozonolysis, each carbon becomes a carbonyl group with substituents.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say, but the problem is about the coupling pattern.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

The most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

If this H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and perhaps adjacent to another CH2 group, its splitting could be a triplet. For example, if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group (like CH2-CH2-C=O), the H on each CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, like a CH2 next to a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, considering the most deshielded H, perhaps it's on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like CH2-C(=O)-R. Then, the H on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. But if this CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if the most deshielded H is on a CH group that's next to a CH2, then it could couple with two H's, giving a doublet. But wait, that would be a doublet, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group that's next to another CH group, which is next to a CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group, leading to coupling with both sets. For example, in a structure like R-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R, the H on each CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet, and perhaps also with any other nearby H's.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structure of product 3.

Product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Product 2 is from heating product 1 with Al(i-Pr)3.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, product 2 could be a diene, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is a diketone.

If product 3 is a diketone, then the most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl groups. Let's say it's a structure like (CH2)2(C=O)-CH2-C(=O)(CH2)2. Then, the H's on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be deshielded and split based on their neighbors.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to a CH2 group. So, the coupling would be with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, making it a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH2 group next to another CH2, the coupling would be with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a CH2, which in turn is next to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, the most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say we have a structure like CH2-C(=O)-R. The H's on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl and perhaps next to another CH2 group.

If the CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H on CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is itself adjacent to another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 that's next to a CH2 which is next to a CH, the coupling could involve two H's from each adjacent group, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a terminal CH group, which would only have one adjacent H, leading to a doublet. But that doesn't match the options given.

Hmm, considering all this, the most likely scenario is that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, it could be a triplet.

But wait, let's think about the NMR data given for product 1, which has 4.79 ppm (2H). If that's an -OCH2- group, then perhaps product 1 is an ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the NMR's 4.79 ppm is due to the -OH groups, but the integration is 2H, which would be a diol, each OH contributing 1H. But that doesn't fit the integration, which is 2H, perhaps as a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH2- group, such as in an epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product after KOH is an epoxide. Then, heating with Al(i-Pr)3 would cause ring-opening. But how? Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but Al(i-Pr)3 is a base. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is treated with the Lewis acid, leading to some kind of rearrangement.

But I'm getting stuck again. Time is limited, so I'll try to make an educated guess.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

The most deshielded H in product 3, after ozonolysis, is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If this CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. So the coupling would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH group, which has two H's, then each H on the CH2 would couple with those two, leading to a triplet. So the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH2 that's next to another CH2, which is next to a CH group, then the coupling would involve more H's, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm not exactly sure. However, considering the options, I think the most probable coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which is option B. Alternatively, maybe a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: in ozonolysis, if the double bond is between two CH2 groups, the product would be two ketones. Each CH2 would become a carbonyl, leading to structures like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So, the H's on the CH2 groups would each be adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2. Thus, each H would have two neighbors (two H's on the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is (CH2)2(CO), then each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So the H's on each CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. So the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be A) triplet.

But earlier I thought it might be a triplet of triplets if there are more couplings, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a CH2, which is next to another CH group, the coupling might involve more H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given the options, I'm leaning towards triplet (option A) or triplet of triplets (option B).

Wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to a CH, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2, then the H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH, and perhaps one H from a more distant CH2. But that would lead to a more complex splitting, like a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 that's part of a longer chain, leading to more couplings.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Based on the options and my reasoning, I think the most deshielded H would couple with two adjacent H's, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be option A) triplet.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. The IR spectrum of the product shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H) could correspond to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, but the IR data strongly supports the formation of a ketone.

### Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃
The ketone product is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) through elimination, as Al(i-Pr)₃ can act as a dehydrating agent.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis and Workup
Product 2, which is an alkene, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely near a carbonyl group.

### Analysis of Coupling Pattern
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is on a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, it would couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet. This matches the splitting pattern described in the options.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. Wait, but in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh wait, wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Hmm, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four-membered rings. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite ends, perhaps. So when KOH is added, would this cause elimination? But wait, elimination usually requires adjacent halogens. Wait, 1,3 are not adjacent. So maybe I'm thinking of the wrong reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, in that case, the two bromines would need to be adjacent. Oh, but 1,3 are not adjacent. Hmm. So perhaps another reaction is happening here. Wait, KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, what if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? But wait, 1 and 3 are two apart. So maybe the structure of adamantane is such that 1 and 3 are adjacent. Wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a diamond structure. Let me think: the structure of adamantane is four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons in a chair-like structure perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is heated with a dihalide, it's a substitution reaction. But substitution with what? Wait, KOH is a base, so maybe it's an elimination.

Wait, let me think again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a product. The product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) which is probably an -OH group or an ether or something else. But wait, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone. Because 1720 is indicative of a ketone. So that suggests oxidation. Wait, but how does that happen from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reaction wrong. Let me think: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with KOH, they eliminate to form an alkene. But in this case, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but I thought 1,3 were not adjacent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure, even though they are numbered 1 and 3. Maybe in the adamantane structure, carbons 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3 is adjacent to 2, so 1 and 3 are on opposite sides but not adjacent. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. But wait, an epoxide would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring. But the product here has a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an epoxide.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH heating is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids could be things like ketones or maybe epoxides, but more likely a ketone. So, reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could be forming an alkene via elimination, but then maybe that alkene is further reacting. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other process.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms an alkene, which then perhaps undergoes some oxidation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step forms an epoxide, which upon further reaction becomes a ketone. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that would require a different mechanism.

Wait, let's think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm peak for 2H. That's a downfield shift, possibly for an -OH group, but could also be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but 4.79 is more in line with an -OH, but the integration is 2H. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Or perhaps it's a ketone adjacent to some CH2 groups.

Wait, the IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So the product is a ketone. That suggests that the starting material went through an oxidation to form a ketone. So, but how? How does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, the OH- could deprotonate a neighboring H, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond. Wait, but then how do you form a ketone from that?

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, the two Brs leave, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbene or something? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and then further oxidation, but under what conditions? Wait, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is forming an epoxide. No, because in the NMR, if it were an epoxide, the protons on the oxygen would be around 3-4 ppm, but the 4.79 is higher, maybe indicating something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense, as the initial molecule is 1,3-dibromo.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group. But if that were the case, the product would be 1,3-dihydroxyl adamantane. Then, that would have two -OH groups. But the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. So maybe each -OH is split into a CH2OH group? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each substitution would be on a different carbon.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is being converted into a diol, but the structure after substitution might have two OH groups adjacent, but then the NMR would show two sets of peaks. Alternatively, maybe the diol is further oxidized into a ketone. Wait, that's possible. But under what conditions? KOH is a strong base but not an oxidizer. Unless it's a peroxide, but the question says KOH is used. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is subjected to a Hofmann elimination? No, that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then further oxidation to form a ketone. Wait, but how would the alkene form a ketone under KOH conditions? Typically, you'd need an oxidizing agent for that. Unless the elimination leads to a conjugated diene or something that can undergo some kind of cyclization.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this first step. Let's think about the product's description. It's a light yellow solid, which is a bit vague. The NMR data includes 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Then the 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests a lot of CH2 or CH groups in a more shielded environment. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But the IR is only showing one carbonyl peak, so maybe a single ketone. Alternatively, it could be a diol that's been oxidized to a ketone. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative? No, that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the next step. The product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride or something that can act as an acylating agent. Wait, but product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Hmm, but KOH is a strong base, not a good nucleophile for acyl chlorides.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and upon treatment with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of cyclization or elimination. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, I'm going to try to think about the possible structures. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then product 2 is formed by heating with Al(i-Pr)3. That could lead to a Friedel-Crafts type reaction if product 1 is an acyl chloride. But product 1 isn't an acyl chloride because it's formed from KOH, which is a base, not something that would form an acyl chloride.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, maybe undergoes elimination to form a double bond. Wait, but for elimination, the two bromines would need to be on adjacent carbons. Oh wait, in adamantane, perhaps the carbons 1 and 3 are adjacent because of the structure. Maybe in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond-like structure, so 1 and 3 could be connected through a bridge. So, perhaps when KOH is added, they eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. That would make product 1 an alkene.

But then, where's the carbonyl coming from? Unless the alkene is further oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some oxidation to form a ketone? No, that doesn't fit with the conditions.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diepoxide. No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent for that. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed via elimination. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution reaction, where each bromide is replaced by hydroxide, forming a diol. If the diol is then treated with a strong acid, perhaps it can form a ketone via pinacol rearrangement. But the first step was with KOH, a base, not an acid.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look up some similar reactions. Oh, wait, I'm just trying to think it through. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, loses two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. But if that's the case, product 1 would be an alkene. Then, what's the IR of an alkene? It would show a C=C peak around 1650 cm-1, but the IR here is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So maybe elimination isn't the reaction.

Wait, what if the reaction is an SN2 substitution? But with two bromines, that would require two SN2 reactions, which would form a diol, 1,3-diol. Then, perhaps the diol is oxidized to a ketone. But under what conditions? KOH would not oxidize, but perhaps the diol is further treated with an oxidizing agent. Wait, but the problem says KOH is used, so maybe the diol isn't the product. Alternatively, maybe the diol is heated with KOH, causing some elimination.

Wait, maybe the diol undergoes dehydration to form a ketone. That would require the diol to have adjacent hydroxyl groups. Wait, if the diol is 1,3-butanediol, upon heating with acid, it can form a ketone via the pinacol rearrangement. But again, KOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is 1,2-diol, which upon elimination would form a carbonyl. Wait, but 1,3-diol can't form a carbonyl via simple elimination. So perhaps the initial product is a diol, and then under certain conditions, it undergoes a rearrangement.

But I think I'm getting too stuck on the first step. Let me try to outline what each step might be doing.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1 (light yellow solid, IR has C=O, so ketone or ester, but more likely ketone).

Step 2: Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → Product 2.

Step 3: Product 2 + ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide → Product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H.

So, let me think about each step.

Step 1: Maybe the heating with KOH converts the dihalide into a ketone. How? Maybe via elimination followed by some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but I thought they were 1 and 3. Maybe in adamantane, 1 and 3 are actually adjacent because of the structure. Let me try to visualize adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, each carbon connected to two others in a tetrahedral arrangement. So perhaps 1 and 3 are adjacent. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So, when KOH is added, they undergo dehydrohalogenation (elimination), forming a double bond. So product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

But then, how does the IR have a C=O peak? Because if it's an alkene, the IR would show a C=C peak. So I'm getting a contradiction here.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Perhaps 1 and 3 are not adjacent but are on the same face, leading to a possibility of some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but if KOH is a base, substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is. But substitution would replace each Br with an -OH, forming a diol. Then, perhaps the diol is oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So, perhaps after substitution to form the diol, another step is needed. But the problem only says KOH is used, so maybe the diol is further treated. Hmm, but the product is a single compound, so maybe the diol is unstable and further reacts.

Wait, maybe the diol eliminates to form a ketone. For that, the diol would have to be a vicinal diol (1,2-diol), which upon elimination forms a ketone. But 1,3-diol can't eliminate to form a ketone. So perhaps the substitution forms a 1,2-diol, which then eliminates to form a ketone.

But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If substitution occurs, each Br is replaced by -OH. So, 1 and 3 would both have -OH groups. But then, for elimination, the -OHs need to be on adjacent carbons. So, if the diol is 1,2-diol, elimination would form a carbonyl. But in this case, the diol would be 1,3, which isn't adjacent, so elimination isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps substitution isn't the right pathway.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong reaction. Let's consider that the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, forming a triple bond? No, that would require two adjacent dihalides, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a single elimination, forming a bromide and a double bond. Wait, but that would require only one Br to leave, which doesn't make sense because KOH is in excess.

Wait, maybe each Br leaves, but in a concerted manner, forming a carbocation or something. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that requires aryl halides, which I don't think is the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find another approach. The product after KOH has a C=O group, as per the IR. So, perhaps the initial reaction is an oxidation of a dihalide to a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to the formation of an epoxide, which then undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening to form a ketone. But again, the conditions here are KOH, a base, not acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a geminal diol. But that requires two OH groups on the same carbon. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on different carbons, so substitution would give two OHs on different carbons, making a vicinal diol or 1,3-diol, which doesn't form a gem diol.

Wait, maybe the diol undergoes some kind of dehydration. For example, in the case of 1,2-diol, heating with acid can form an alkene. But with 1,3-diol, perhaps it's possible to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is oxidized to a ketone. But again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structure of product 1. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, perhaps. Could that be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester? Or maybe an alcohol.

Wait, the product after KOH is a solid, which could be something like a dialkyl ether, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Ester carbonyls are around 1740, ketones around 1715. So, this is near a ketone. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → ketone.

But how? Let me think about oxidative cleavage. Oxidative cleavage of a dihalide would require something like ozonolysis, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to elimination and then some kind of keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a ring contraction, releasing HBr and forming a ketone.

Wait, here's another angle: adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so when two bromines are eliminated, perhaps a bridge is broken, leading to a carbonyl group. For example, elimination of two HBr from adjacent carbons could form a carbonyl. Wait, that might make sense.

Wait, in some structures, when adjacent dihalides undergo elimination, they form a double bond. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl, like in a ring contraction, perhaps that's what's happening.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is part of a bicyclic structure, and elimination leads to a smaller ring with a carbonyl. This is getting a bit abstract, but perhaps that's the case.

Assuming that product 1 is a ketone, let's move on to step 2.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the ketone itself can't undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation because the carbonyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a benzene ring with a ketone group, but that's not the case here because the starting material is adamantane-based.

Wait, perhaps product 1 has an alkyl group that can undergo a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, but that's unlikely because KOH is a base, and it would hydrolyze acyl chlorides to ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and the Lewis acid is facilitating some kind of elimination or substitution. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might not do much, unless it's part of some kind of enolate chemistry. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Lewis acid is causing ring opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid is causing it to form a cyclic ether or something else. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, I think I'm not getting much further on step 2. Let's proceed to step 3, maybe it will give me some clues.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. The reaction is typically done at low temperatures (-78°C) to prevent over-reaction. Ozone cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups.

After ozonolysis, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is added. DMS is a reductive workup agent; it prevents the formation of ozonides and reduces any ozonide intermediates to aldehydes or ketones.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded hydrogens are usually those in the most electron-deficient areas, like near carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, and product 3 has carbonyl groups, perhaps the structure of product 3 has some symmetry or groups that lead to a particular coupling pattern.

Let me try to put it all together. Maybe the overall reaction sequence is:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (a ketone) → (Al(i-Pr)3, heat) → product 2 (perhaps an alkene) → (ozone, DMS) → product 3 (with carbonyl groups).

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an alkene formed via some acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps elimination. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon heating with Al(i-Pr)3 becomes an alkene. Wait, but how? Aluminum isopropoxide is more of a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts, not for opening epoxides.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, undergoes elimination to form an alkene. That makes sense. So, if product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 (which can act as a dehydrating agent) would eliminate H2O, forming an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, let's piece it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → 1,3-diol (product 1).

Step 2: 1,3-diol + Al(i-Pr)3 → elimination of water, forming an alkene (product 2).

Step 3: Alkene (product 2) undergoes ozonolysis → cleavage into carbonyl-containing product (product 3).

But how does the diol (product 1) become an alkene (product 2)? Well, if the diol is a 1,2-diol, elimination would form an alkene. But if it's a 1,3-diol, elimination isn't possible because the hydroxyl groups aren't adjacent. So, perhaps product 1 is a 1,2-diol, which upon elimination forms an alkene.

Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so substitution would give a 1,3-diol, which can't eliminate. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the initial reaction isn't substitution but elimination.

Wait, let's get back. Maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone. How? If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. That would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons, which in adamantane, perhaps they are.

Assuming that, product 1 would be a ketone, such as adamantanone.

Then, step 2: product 1 (adamantanone) is treated with Al(i-Pr)3. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an acyl chloride, but product 1 is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe Al(i-Pr)3 is used to form an enol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(i-Pr)3 is causing ring-opening to form a diol. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, and step 2 does something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bromoalkane, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the possible product after ozonolysis.

Product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks it into two carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl group. Its coupling pattern would depend on adjacent hydrogens.

So, for example, if the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH2 group, it could be a triplet or a doublet, depending on splitting.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. If product 2 is a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would form two ketones. Alternatively, if it's a cis-alkene, the products would differ, but the splitting pattern would depend on the neighboring groups.

But wait, when the alkene is ozonolyzed, the resulting carbonyl groups are adjacent to the original substituents. So, if the double bond was between carbons A and B, each with substituents, then after ozonolysis, each carbon becomes a carbonyl group with substituents.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say, but the problem is about the coupling pattern.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

The most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

If this H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and perhaps adjacent to another CH2 group, its splitting could be a triplet. For example, if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group (like CH2-CH2-C=O), the H on each CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, like a CH2 next to a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, considering the most deshielded H, perhaps it's on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like CH2-C(=O)-R. Then, the H on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. But if this CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if the most deshielded H is on a CH group that's next to a CH2, then it could couple with two H's, giving a doublet. But wait, that would be a doublet, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group that's next to another CH group, which is next to a CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group, leading to coupling with both sets. For example, in a structure like R-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R, the H on each CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet, and perhaps also with any other nearby H's.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structure of product 3.

Product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Product 2 is from heating product 1 with Al(i-Pr)3.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, product 2 could be a diene, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is a diketone.

If product 3 is a diketone, then the most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl groups. Let's say it's a structure like (CH2)2(C=O)-CH2-C(=O)(CH2)2. Then, the H's on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be deshielded and split based on their neighbors.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to a CH2 group. So, the coupling would be with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, making it a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH2 group next to another CH2, the coupling would be with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a CH2, which in turn is next to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, the most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say we have a structure like CH2-C(=O)-R. The H's on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl and perhaps next to another CH2 group.

If the CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H on CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is itself adjacent to another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 that's next to a CH2 which is next to a CH, the coupling could involve two H's from each adjacent group, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a terminal CH group, which would only have one adjacent H, leading to a doublet. But that doesn't match the options given.

Hmm, considering all this, the most likely scenario is that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, it could be a triplet.

But wait, let's think about the NMR data given for product 1, which has 4.79 ppm (2H). If that's an -OCH2- group, then perhaps product 1 is an ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the NMR's 4.79 ppm is due to the -OH groups, but the integration is 2H, which would be a diol, each OH contributing 1H. But that doesn't fit the integration, which is 2H, perhaps as a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH2- group, such as in an epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product after KOH is an epoxide. Then, heating with Al(i-Pr)3 would cause ring-opening. But how? Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but Al(i-Pr)3 is a base. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is treated with the Lewis acid, leading to some kind of rearrangement.

But I'm getting stuck again. Time is limited, so I'll try to make an educated guess.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

The most deshielded H in product 3, after ozonolysis, is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If this CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. So the coupling would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH group, which has two H's, then each H on the CH2 would couple with those two, leading to a triplet. So the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH2 that's next to another CH2, which is next to a CH group, then the coupling would involve more H's, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm not exactly sure. However, considering the options, I think the most probable coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which is option B. Alternatively, maybe a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: in ozonolysis, if the double bond is between two CH2 groups, the product would be two ketones. Each CH2 would become a carbonyl, leading to structures like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So, the H's on the CH2 groups would each be adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2. Thus, each H would have two neighbors (two H's on the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is (CH2)2(CO), then each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So the H's on each CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. So the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be A) triplet.

But earlier I thought it might be a triplet of triplets if there are more couplings, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a CH2, which is next to another CH group, the coupling might involve more H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given the options, I'm leaning towards triplet (option A) or triplet of triplets (option B).

Wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to a CH, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2, then the H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH, and perhaps one H from a more distant CH2. But that would lead to a more complex splitting, like a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 that's part of a longer chain, leading to more couplings.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Based on the options and my reasoning, I think the most deshielded H would couple with two adjacent H's, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be option A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. The IR spectrum of the product shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H) could correspond to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, but the IR data strongly supports the formation of a ketone.

### Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃
The ketone product is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) through elimination, as Al(i-Pr)₃ can act as a dehydrating agent.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis and Workup
Product 2, which is an alkene, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely near a carbonyl group.

### Analysis of Coupling Pattern
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is on a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, it would couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet. This matches the splitting pattern described in the options.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
