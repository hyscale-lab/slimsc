Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key thing here is the NOESY NMR data, which shows a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor. I need to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

First, I'll go through the reaction steps. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of such an acid typically forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride must be considered. Since the original alkene is cis, the resulting anhydride will have a structure that reflects that geometry.

Looking at the NMR data of the anhydride: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an aromatic proton, but wait, no, the starting material is an anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aliphatic proton, but 7 ppm is usually aromatic. Hmm, but wait, if the starting dicarboxylic acid is a cyclo structure? No, wait, the anhydride would have an oxygen ring perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride structure is such that there are equivalent protons causing a single peak. Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which suggests a set of equivalent protons. Could it be a cyclopentadienyl ring? No, because the product comes from reacting with cyclopentadiene. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak. The 1H NMR is usually for protons. So, an anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid would have an oxygen bridge. The structure would be something like (RCO)₂O. In such an anhydride, the carbonyl groups are connected by an oxygen. If the original dicarboxylic acid had a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form the anhydride, possibly with a ring structure, or maybe a five-membered ring if the diacid is adjacent.

Wait, the 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon shifts can help identify what's going on. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon (maybe an ester or anhydride). And 137 ppm is probably a sp² hybridized carbon, perhaps from an alkene or an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Wait, but the anhydride is formed from a diacid, so the structure would have two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen. So, for example, if the diacid is something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a cis double bond, wait no, that would be a dien structure. Wait, perhaps the diacid is a cyclo structure, like a cyclopentane diacid? Or maybe it's a diacid with a double bond adjacent to the COOH groups.

Wait, the starting acid has a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, the two COOH groups lose water and form an anhydride. The structure would be an anhydride with the two carbonyls connected by an oxygen bridge. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's really high for a typical proton, which suggests maybe aromatic protons or an enol type structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridging proton. Wait, but anhydrides usually don't have protons in the same way as, say, ketones or aldehydes. Wait no, but maybe the diacid had a ring with protons that became equivalent in the anhydride.

Wait, maybe the diacid is a cyclo structure. For example, a cyclohexene dicarboxylic acid. Dehydrating that would form an anhydride with a conjugated diene or some ring structure. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring, which would make the structure more stable. So, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic one, like a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high shift, so maybe it's a vinylic proton. Or maybe it's a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is part of a benzene ring. Wait, no, because the starting material is a diacid, probably not aromatic.

Hmm, let's think differently. If the anhydride has a structure with two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen and the rest of the structure is such that all the protons are equivalent. So, perhaps all the non-carbonyl protons are equivalent, leading to a single peak in the 1H NMR.

Wait, but 7 ppm is high. Maybe it's a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. For example, a vinyl proton adjacent to two carbonyls. Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton, but that would require an aromatic ring, which I'm not sure the diacid has.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride's structure has a conjugated diene. If the original diacid had a cis double bond, the dehydration would form an anhydride with a conjugated double bond. So, maybe the anhydride structure is something like:

O
||
O-C-(CH₂)₂-C-O
            ||
            O

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a five-membered ring anhydride, which would have a double bond within the ring. So, the structure would have a conjugated carbonyl and double bond.

In that case, perhaps the 1H NMR's 7 ppm peak is from a proton adjacent to the carbonyl and the double bond. For example, in a cyclic anhydride, there might be two equivalent vinylic protons, but in this case, the 1H NMR shows a single peak, implying they are equivalent. So, maybe it's a trans double bond, leading to equivalent protons, or a cis that's symmetric.

But wait, the starting alkene was cis. So, the anhydride would have a cis double bond, which would make the two protons on either end equivalent.

Wait, but in the anhydride, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. That could lead to deshielded protons, hence the high chemical shift around 7 ppm.

So, the anhydride has a structure with a double bond, and the protons on the double bond are deshielded, giving a singlet at 7 ppm. The 13C NMR shows two peaks: one at 137 ppm (probably the double bond carbons, sp² hybridized) and one at 165 ppm (the carbonyl carbons).

So, the anhydride is probably a cyclic structure with a conjugated double bond and two carbonyl groups. Now, when this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, what happens?

Wait, the reaction is between the anhydride and the cyclopentadiene. I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction, where the anhydride is the dienophile and the cyclopentadiene is the diene.

But wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene. So, the anhydride would act as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. The Diels-Alder adds across the diene and dienophile to form a six-membered ring with two substituents.

Wait, but the cyclopentadiene is quite substituted—tetramethyl. So, the diene is in the 1,3 positions, with methyl groups on all four carbons. So, the structure is a cyclopentene ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have two double bonds? Or wait, 1,3-pentadiene is a conjugated diene. So, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene would have the structure where the ring is cyclopentane with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but that's not possible because cyclopentane is a five-membered ring. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentene with two double bonds? No, wait, perhaps it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. So, the structure is a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring, with methyl groups on all four of those positions.

So, the diene is a cyclic diene, which is a good diene for Diels-Alder reactions. The dienophile would be the anhydride. So, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (anhydride) would form a six-membered ring, with the substituents from the dienophile added to the diene.

The product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps with substituents from both the dienophile and the diene.

Wait, but the dienophile is the anhydride, which is a cyclic anhydride. The Diels-Alder would add the dienophile across the diene, forming a six-membered ring with the substituents from the anhydride.

But the question says two products are formed: major and minor. So, perhaps the reaction can proceed through different transition states or different endo vs. exo approaches, leading to different stereochemistry in the products.

The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, so they must be stereoisomers, perhaps diastereomers or epimers.

The NOESY data shows a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons. If a cross-peak exists, it implies that two protons are close in space, even if they are not necessarily adjacent in the structure.

In the major product, two protons are close, whereas in the minor, they are not.

So, the cross-peak in the major product would connect two protons that are on opposite ends of a ring or in a certain conformation where they are near each other.

Looking at the options, all the choices describe pairs of protons. The question is, which pair would show a cross-peak in the major product.

The options are:

A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm

B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm

D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

I need to figure out which two protons are close in the structure of the major product but not in the minor.

Let me think about the structure of the product.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclopentadiene) would add to the dienophile (anhydride). The anhydride is a cyclic structure, perhaps a five-membered ring, with two carbonyl groups.

The Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure, perhaps a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system or similar. Alternatively, maybe a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, the dienophile is a cyclic anhydride, O=C-(CH₂)₂-C=O, but connected in a ring. Let's say it's a five-membered ring, like:

O
||
O-C-(CH₂)₂-C-O
            ||
            O

Wait, no, that's not a ring. Alternatively, the anhydride ring would have four members? Like O-C-O connected in a ring with two carbonyls. Wait, that's a four-membered ring, but that's less common. Probably, the anhydride is a five-membered ring, which is more stable.

So, the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring, fusing with the cyclopentadiene's ring. So, the product would be a bicyclic compound.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me think about the possible structures of the products.

The anhydride has two carbonyl groups, so after the Diels-Alder, the product would have those as substituents on the six-membered ring.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, the cyclopentadiene ring has four methyl groups attached—probably at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the structure would be a cyclopentane ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, and methyl groups on 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Wait, no, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a single conjugated diene, right? So, it's a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene across four carbons.

So, the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ in a ring? No, that's not correct because cyclopentane is five-membered. So, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene.

So, adding four methyl groups (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl) would mean that each of those four carbons has a methyl group. So, the structure would be a cyclopentene ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, and each of those four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl substituent.

When this reacts with the dienophile (the anhydride), the Diels-Alder would add the dienophile across the diene, forming a bicyclic structure.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would favor the more substituted product, which is usually the major product. The minor product would be the exo form or perhaps a different stereochemistry.

But since the question mentions that both products have the same molecular formula, they must differ in stereochemistry.

Now, the NOESY cross-peak in the major product suggests that two protons are close in space, which would happen if they are on adjacent atoms in a ring or in a certain conformation.

Looking at the options, the possible pairs are:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (probably methyl groups, maybe on the cyclopentane ring) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (maybe a CH group adjacent to something else).

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (maybe another set of methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (possibly an OCH₂ group? Or perhaps adjacent to an oxygen).

C) 6H singlet and another 6H singlet at different ppm values. Maybe both are methyl groups.

D) 1H doublet and 2H singlet.

But wait, the anhydride has two carbonyl groups, so after the Diels-Alder, the product would have an oxygen bridge. So, perhaps the product has a six-membered ring with substituents from the anhydride.

In the major product, which has a cross-peak in NOESY, the two protons involved are in close proximity. This could be, for example, a CH group and a methyl group that are on adjacent carbons but on opposite sides of a ring, leading to through-space proximity.

Alternatively, maybe the two protons are part of a bridge structure, making them close in space.

But without the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. Let me think about the possible shifts.

In the options, the 6H singlet at ~1 ppm would be a set of equivalent methyl groups, perhaps in a shielded environment. The 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm is likely a CH group near another CH group, perhaps in a ring.

The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm might be another set of methyl groups, possibly more deshielded.

The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm suggests two equivalent protons, maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH₂ group, but singlet implies no neighboring protons.

Now, considering the major product, the cross-peak connects two resonances. So, if in the major product, a CH group is close to a methyl group, that could explain the cross-peak.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (methyl) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH). If these are on adjacent carbons, they might be close in space.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (maybe a different set of methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H might be near an oxygen.

Option C: Both are 6H singlets, so maybe two different methyl groups, but I'm not sure.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet. Maybe a CH and an OCH₂ group.

The cross-peak is present in the major product. In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state would lead to the substituents being on the same face, possibly leading to closer proximity between certain protons.

So, perhaps in the major product, the substituents from the anhydride are on the same side, causing a CH group and a methyl group to be close.

Which option would that correspond to?

Option A connects a 6H singlet (methyl) and a 1H doublet. If the methyl is adjacent to the CH, then in the major product, they are on the same face, leading to a cross-peak. In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are on opposite faces, making the CH and methyl groups not close, so no cross-peak.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. If the 1H is a CH group and the 2H are, say, OCH₂, then proximity could occur.

Wait, but the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an OCH₂ group if it's adjacent to an oxygen. But in the Diels-Alder product, the oxygen would be part of the six-membered ring as an ether or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2H singlet is part of a ring structure, but being deshielded.

Alternatively, let's think about the product's structure. The Diels-Alder adduct would have the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) positioned in a specific way.

The anhydride's oxygen would form part of the adduct, perhaps leading to a bridge or a new ring.

Wait, the molecular formula is C13H16O3. The starting dienophile (anhydride) would have a certain formula, and the diene (tetramethylcyclopentadiene) is C9H12. The reaction would form C13H16O3, which suggests that the dienophile was C4H4O3 maybe? Because 9 (dien) + 4 (dienophile) =13, and O3 would come from the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride. The formula for a diacid (HOOC-R-COOH) would be CnH2nO4. Dehydrating would remove two H2O, so the anhydride would be CnH2n-2O3. So, for example, if R is a two-carbon (like ethene), the diacid would be HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH, which upon dehydration becomes (HOOC)₂C=CH₂-O. Wait, that's not correct. Maybe better to think in terms of molecular formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting diacid is something like HOOC-(CH₂)₂-COOH. Dehydration would form the anhydride, which would have the formula (HOOC)₂(C₂H₃O₂)₂? Wait, no, perhaps the formula calculation is better.

The anhydride arises from two carboxylic acids losing a water each. So, each carboxylic acid is RCOOH. Two of them would be RCOOH and RCOOH. Upon dehydration, the formula would be (RCO)₂O plus H2O. So, the formula would be (RCO)₂O, which is R₂C₂O₃. So, for the diacid R being (CH₂)₂, the formula would be (CH₂CH₂CO)₂O, which would be C4H6O3.

Wait, but the dienophile is the anhydride, and the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C9H12. So, the product of the Diels-Alder would be C9H12 + C4H6O3 → C13H18O3. But the product has C13H16O3, so two hydrogens less. So, perhaps the dienophile is smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a three-membered ring? Let me think about the molecular formula. The product is C13H16O3. The diene is C9H12. So, the dienophile must be C4H4O3. Because 9 + 4 =13, and 12 +4=16, but considering the Diels-Alder forms two new sigma bonds, losing four hydrogens (since Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition, which consumes 6 pi electrons, and the product's hydrogen count is diene (12) + dienophile (4) - 4 (lost in bonding) = 12. But wait, the product is C13H16O3, so maybe the dienophile is C4H4O3, adding to the diene (C9H12) to make C13H16O3.

So, the dienophile's formula is C4H4O3. That matches an anhydride of a two-carbon diacid. For example, the anhydride of succinic acid (HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH) would be (HOOC)₂(CH₂CH₂)O, which is C4H6O3. But that doesn't match C4H4O3. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride with a double bond, which would have fewer hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is maleic anhydride, which has the formula C4H2O3. Maleic anhydride is (HO₂C)₂C=O, but wait, no, maleic anhydride is cyclic, with the formula C4H2O3. So, maybe the dienophile is maleic anhydride.

If that's the case, then the dienophile has the formula C4H2O3. The diene is C9H12. So, the product would be C13H14O3, but the question states the product is C13H16O3. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the dienophile is a different structure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the dienophile is another anhydride with a formula that allows the product to have C13H16O3. Let's say the dienophile is C4H4O3, and the diene is C9H12, so 4+9=13, 4+12=16. So, that fits.

So, the dienophile is C4H4O3. Maleic anhydride is C4H2O3, so perhaps a different dienophile.

Well, perhaps this line of thinking isn't getting me much further. Let me pivot.

The products have the same molecular formula, so their structures must differ in the arrangement of substituents. The major product has a cross-peak in NOESY, implying two protons are spatially close.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state leads to the substituents from the dienophile being on the same face as the diene's substituents. So, if the dienophile has two substituents (like two carbonyl groups), they would end up on the same face of the new six-membered ring.

If the major product is the endo adduct, the substituents (like the two carbonyl oxygens) are on the same face, which would bring certain protons into close proximity.

Now, the NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects two protons that are close because of the endo arrangement.

Looking at the options, which pair would be close due to the endo transition state.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5. Maybe a methyl group and a CH group adjacent.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5.

Option C: Two methyl singlets.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet.

The cross-peak is present in the major product, which has the endo arrangement, so the protons must be on the same face.

Let me think of the structure: in the Diels-Alder adduct, the two substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) are on the same face of the six-membered ring. So, any protons that are on adjacent carbons and on the same face would be close.

If the dienophile is a cyclic anhydride with two carbonyl groups, the substituents would be on the same face, leading the adjacent protons on the new ring to be close.

Wait, but the dienophile is the anhydride, which is O=C-R-C=O, connected in a ring. So, in the adduct, the substituents (the R groups) from the dienophile would be on the same face of the ring.

So, in the product, the protons adjacent to these substituents would be close.

So, perhaps a CH group from the ring is near a methyl group from the diene.

In the diene, which is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, all four carbons (1,2,3,4) have methyl groups.

After the Diels-Alder, the substituents (methyl groups) would be on the same face as the dienophile's substituents.

So, in the major product, a methyl group (from the diene) and a proton on the new ring (from the dienophile) would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Looking at the options, which pair fits this scenario.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (perhaps a CH group adjacent to the methyls).

If the CH group is adjacent to the methyl group, in the endo arrangement, they would be close in space, leading to a cross-peak.

So, in the major product, the CH and the methyl would be near, leading to a cross-peak. In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are opposite, so the CH and methyl are not close, hence no cross-peak.

So, the correct pair would be the 6H singlet (methyl) and the 1H doublet (CH). That's option A.

Wait, but the 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm would be near the methyl group, which is a singlet at 1 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups in the product are split into different environments. But in the diene, all four methyl groups are equivalent, but upon Diels-Alder, some might end up in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet at 1 ppm are the methyl groups from the diene, which are all equivalent.

Wait, but the major product has a cross-peak between a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. So, the 6H would belong to a group of six equivalent protons, perhaps three methyl groups each contributing two H (but that's 6 H). Wait, no, each methyl has three H, but if there are two methyl groups, that would be six H. But in the diene, each of the four positions has a methyl, but perhaps in the product, some are equivalent.

Wait, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. So, each of the four carbons in the diene ring has a methyl. So, four methyl groups, each with three H, making 12 H. But the product has a 6H singlet, so perhaps two methyl groups are equivalent, each contributing 3H, making a 6H singlet. Or perhaps some are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a bridge, making some methyl groups equivalent.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The key is the cross-peak in the NOESY for the major product. It indicates two protons that are close in space. So, the two resonances in the options must correspond to protons that are adjacent in the structure, perhaps on the same face of a ring.

In the major product (endo transition state), substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents. So, any methyl groups on the diene would be on the same face as the substituents from the anhydride, leading their protons to be close.

So, the 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm could be a proton adjacent to an oxygen (from the anhydride), and the 6H singlet at 1 ppm could be methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the 6H singlet at 1 ppm would have to be a set of equivalent methyl groups, perhaps in a symmetric position.

Alternatively, another possibility: in the product, the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride are across from each other, but in the endo product, one is on the same face as a methyl group from the diene, leading to proximity.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. Another approach is to think about the integration.

Each option gives two integrals. For instance, option A is a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. So, 6+1=7 H. The product's molecular formula is C13H16O3. So, the total H is 16. But in the NOESY, only two groups are considered for the cross-peak.

Wait, but the cross-peak in the 2D NOESY would involve two protons from each other's vicinity. So, each resonance in the cross-peak would be from a different proton.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would place substituents on the same face. So, any substituents that are bulky would be on the same face, leading to a more favorable transition state.

So, in the major product, substituents (like the methyl groups) are on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile (like the carbonyl groups). That would bring certain protons into close proximity.

If the product has a six-membered ring, perhaps the substituents (like methyl groups) are on adjacent carbons. So, a methyl group and a CH group attached to the same carbon would be close. Wait, no, adjacent carbons would share a bond, but the cross-peak would be a through-bond correlation, not through-space. So, NOESY captures through-space proximity, not through-bond.

Ah, so the two protons don't need to be adjacent; they just need to be close in space, perhaps on adjacent rings or in a bridged structure.

Wait, let's imagine the product is a bicyclic compound. For example, the Diels-Alder forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure, with substituents from the dienophile and diene.

In such a structure, there might be a bridge, and protons on opposite ends of the bridge could be close in space.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a bridgehead proton that's close to another group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible shifts.

6H singlet at ~1 ppm: likely a set of equivalent methyl groups, possibly in a highly shielded environment, like in a bridge or near an electron-donating group.

1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: a CH group, maybe near another CH group, or adjacent to a substituent.

If the CH group is near a methyl group, the through-space interaction would show a cross-peak.

So, in the major product, the CH is near the methyl, leading to a cross-peak in NOESY. In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are on opposite faces, making the CH and methyl not close.

Thus, the cross-peak connects the CH (1H doublet) and the methyl (6H singlet).

Looking at the options, option A is a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet.

So, the answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major product and a minor product, both with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The key difference between the products is revealed by the 2D NOESY NMR spectra, which shows a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor product. This cross-peak indicates spatial proximity between two protons in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is likely a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups and a conjugated double bond. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, consistent with deshielded protons, such as vinylic protons near carbonyl groups. The 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp² carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon), confirming the presence of a conjugated system.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (diene) forms a bicyclic product. The major product likely follows the endo rule, where substituents from the dienophile and diene are on the same face of the newly formed six-membered ring. This arrangement brings certain protons into close spatial proximity, as detected by the NOESY cross-peak.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak in the Major Product**:  
   The cross-peak in the major product indicates that two protons are spatially close. This is consistent with the endo transition state, where substituents from the dienophile (e.g., carbonyl groups) and the diene (e.g., methyl groups) are on the same face of the ring. The minor product, likely the exo isomer, does not have this spatial arrangement, resulting in no cross-peak.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a CH group). These protons are consistent with spatial proximity in the major product due to the endo arrangement.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. These protons are less likely to be close in space based on the reaction mechanism.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. This does not explain the spatial proximity required for a cross-peak.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. While possible, this pair is less consistent with the expected spatial arrangement in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product connects a 6H singlet (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet (likely a CH group), consistent with the endo transition state where these protons are spatially close. This matches **Option A**.
