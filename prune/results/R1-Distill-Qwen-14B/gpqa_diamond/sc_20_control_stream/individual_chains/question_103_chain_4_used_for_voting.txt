Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, this looks like a multi-step organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The substituents are a bromine and a nitro group, and there's also a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to a methyl group. So the ketone is on the benzene as a substituent, and the positions of the other groups (bromo and nitro) matter.

The target structure: Benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group in position 1. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is in position 1, then the positions 3 and 5 are meta and para to it. Let me visualize:

Position 1: ketone (O=C-CH3)
Position 3: Br
Position 5: NO2

So, the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So when we start with benzene, we need to introduce these groups in the correct order.

I remember that directing effects are crucial here. Nitro groups are meta directors, while bromine can be ortho/para but in substitution reactions, sometimes when it's a leaving group, it can have different behavior. The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta director.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduces the ketone group, benzene must be activated. Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts requires the aromatic ring to be activated, like having activating groups. But if I have a benzene ring with deactivating groups, I can't do Friedel-Crafts on it. So that suggests that the ketone group must be introduced early, before any deactivating groups are added. Because if I add nitro groups first, then the ring is deactivated, and Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

So, the plan should be: introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then bromine? Or perhaps another order?

Wait, the target has both nitro and bromine in the ring. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So, if I nitrate after the ketone, the nitro group would go into a meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would be next. But if the ring already has a nitro group, which is a strong meta director, and a ketone (also meta), how do new substituents get added?

Wait, maybe the order is: first introduce the ketone via Friedel-Crafts acylation, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, their directing effects can be a bit tricky. Let me think about each step.

Starting with benzene.

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene + CH3COCl, AlCl3 → acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So now, the ring has a ketone group, which is a meta director.

2. Nitration: next, we need to nitrate the ring. The nitro group will enter at the meta position relative to the ketone. Wait, the acetophenone has the ketone in position 1. So nitration would occur in position 3 or 5? Wait, the meta positions from the ketone would be positions 3 and 5. So where does nitro go? It should go into one of these positions. But since it's the first nitration, maybe it goes into position 3, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So when you have acetophenone, the positions are 2,4,6 as possible for substitution. Wait, no, the ketone is at position 1. So the possible positions for nitration are 3,4,5,6? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: acetophenone is benzene with a ketone at position 1. The nitro group is a meta director, but the ketone is also a meta director. So the nitro would enter in a position that's meta to the ketone. So that would be positions 3 or 5 relative to the ketone. But wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 3 and 5 are adjacent in a way. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituents and their directing effects. The ketone is a meta directing group, so when we nitrate, the nitro group will go into a position meta to the ketone. So, the first nitration would add nitro at position 3, then the next step would add bromine.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring becomes more deactivated. So, bromination via electrophilic substitution (like using Br2 with FeBr3) requires the ring to be activated. If the ring has a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, and a ketone, which is also deactivating, then the bromination might not proceed easily. So maybe bromination needs to happen before nitration?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because bromine, as a substituent, is a ortho/para director, but it's a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the -I effect). So bromine would deactivate the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce substituents in a way that allows the next reaction to proceed. Let me outline the possible steps.

Option 1: Introduce the ketone first. Then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is highly deactivated. So bromination would be difficult. So perhaps nitration can't happen after ketone and bromine.

Alternatively, maybe bromination is done first. But benzene doesn't brominate unless we have a catalyst. So, perhaps after introducing a group that activates the ring.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about each possible reaction step.

Looking at the options, each option is a sequence of steps. Let's analyze each option to see which makes sense.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduces the ketone. Then ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? Not sure. v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. vii) H3PO2 → what's that? H3PO2 is used in the Sandmeyer reaction, maybe, but I'm not certain. Hmm, this seems complex. So after two nitrations and two brominations, but I'm not sure.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate benzene to bromobenzene. Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. iv) HNO3 again. v) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step, like converting nitro to amine. vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. vii) H3PO2 → maybe a substitution reaction. Hmm, but after acylation, the ring is already deactivating. So nitration after acylation would be difficult, as the ring is deactivating, making electrophilic substitution harder.

Option C: i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene. Then ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine. iii) CH3COCl → acylation. Then iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. v) HNO3 → nitrate again. vi) NaNO2 → diazo. vii) H3PO2. Wait, nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is an activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would work. Then brominate. But wait, the product after acylation would have an aniline group? No, because after reduction, the nitro becomes NH2. Then Friedel-Crafts would introduce the ketone. But then bromination needs to happen in the ring that has both NH2 and ketone groups.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps after acylation, we have a ring with a ketone and a bromine.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first nitrate, then acylate, then brominate.

Wait, but nitration is a meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to the existing groups.

Wait, let's redo the target structure.

Target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene has:

Position 1: O=C-CH3 (since it's ethan-1-one)
Position 3: Br
Position 5: NO2

So, starting from benzene, let me figure out the order of substituent addition.

If I first introduce the ketone (Friedel-Crafts), then the ring has a meta-directing group. Then, nitration would add a nitro group in the meta position—so position 3 or 5 relative to the ketone. But then bromination would need to add another substituent in a specific position.

Wait, but perhaps the order is: first nitrate, then acylate, then brominate.

But the problem is that benzene is an electron-rich ring, so nitration is easy. Then, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work because the ring is deactivated. So that's a problem.

So perhaps the acylation must come first, before any deactivating groups are added.

So plan:

1. Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) → introduces ketone (meta director).
2. Nitration → adds nitro group meta to ketone (so at position 3 or 5). Let's say position 3.
3. Now, how to add bromine at position 5? Because after nitration, the ring has two substituents: ketone at 1, nitro at 3.

Wait, but if there are two substituents, their directing effects can influence each other. The nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. So when adding a new group, the positions would be influenced by both.

In this case, after acylation and nitration, the ring has groups at positions 1 (ketone) and 3 (nitro). The ketone is a meta director, the nitro is a meta director. So, the next substituent (bromine) would be added in a position that is meta to both.

Wait, but that's not possible because the ring is already occupied. So perhaps the next bromination would occur in a position that's meta to one and para to the other, depending on their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Maybe the bromine is introduced before nitration. But if I brominate benzene first, using FeBr3, then I have bromobenzene. Then, I can nitrate it. But bromobenzene's bromine is a meta director and deactivates the ring. So nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to bromine. So nitro at position 5. Then, after that, I can acylate.

Wait, let's see:

1. Benzene → brominate → bromobenzene (position 1: Br).
2. Bromobenzene → nitration → nitro group at position 3 (meta to Br).
3. Now, have Br at 1, nitro at 3. Now, acylation via Friedel-Crafts would introduce ketone. But wait, the ring is now deactivated with Br and nitro. Friedel-Crafts requires an active ring. So that's a problem. So this order won't work because the ring is too deactivated.

Hmm. So perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe introduce the groups that activate the ring after other substituents. But wait, nitro groups and bromine deactivate the ring. So the only activating group would be the ketone, but that's a deactivating group because it's electron-withdrawing.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the nitro group first, then the ketone, then bromine. But again, nitro deactivates the ring, making acylation difficult.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introduce the ketone, then bromine, then nitration. Let's think:

1. Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (position 1: ketone).
2. Then, brominate. Since the ketone is a meta director, bromine would go into position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.
3. Now, acetophenone with Br at 3. Now, need to nitrate. The ring already has two substituents: ketone (1) and Br (3). The nitro group would have to go into a position that's activated. But the ring is deactivated because of the ketone and Br, which are deactivating. So nitration might not be feasible.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should look at the possible options and see which sequence aligns with the target structure.

Let me review the options again.

Option C: steps are HNO3 → Fe/HCl → CH3COCl → Br2 → HNO3 → etc. Let's see.

Option C:
i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.
iii) CH3COCl → acylation. So now, we have aniline (from reduction) and acylation would add ketone. Wait, but aniline is an activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would work. But wait, then you have a benzene ring with an amine and a ketone. Then, iv) Br2 → brominate. V) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Wait, but after acylation, the ring has an amine group and a ketone. The amine is an activating group (ortho/para director), but the ketone is deactivating (meta). So the next substitution would be directed by both. Maybe the bromine goes into a position influenced by both.

But this seems complicated. Let's think about the overall product.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other. So, the substituents are all meta to each other.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.
2. Brominate (using FeBr3) → Br would go to position 3 (meta to nitro).
3. Then acylation. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so acylation (Friedel-Crafts) won't work.

Hmm, that can't be. So alternative approach: Let me think about the substituent order. The ketone is position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then nitro, then Br. But as I thought earlier, after ketone and nitro, the ring is too deactivated for Br to add.

Another approach: Maybe the nitro group is introduced after the Br. Let's see:

1. Benzene → acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Then, brominate → Br at 3.
3. Now, the ring has ketone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director, but deactivating). So, when nitrating, where would the nitro group go?

Hmm, the nitro group is a strong meta director, but the ring is already deactivated. So nitration might not occur. Or perhaps the Br is an ortho/para director, but deactivating, and the ketone is a meta director. So the nitro group would go into a position that's meta to the ketone, but perhaps the Br is in a position that directs it elsewhere.

This is getting too confusing. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.
ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at meta to Br (so position 5, if Br is at 1).
iii) CH3COCl → acylation. But wait, bromobenzene is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option B's steps seem problematic because after bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acylation can't proceed.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → N2+Cl-.
iv) H3PO2 → Sandmeyer reaction? H3PO2 is used for the Clemmensen reduction (which reduces ketones to CH2 groups, but that's not this), or maybe for the Mitsunobu reaction, not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 can be used in the presence of a copper catalyst for the substitution of diazonium salts with halides, which might introduce a Br or Cl.

Wait, but in this option, after nitration and reduction, we have aniline. Then, maybe the next step is acylation.

Wait, let's see:

Option D's steps: i) nitrate, ii) reduce nitro to amine, iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride, iv) H3PO2 → perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by something.

But wait, H3PO2 is usually used in the presence of a base for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to CH2Cl groups, but I might be mixing it up.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, H3PO2 would substitute it with a bromine via the Sandmeyer reaction, but that uses CuX and HX. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are introducing bromine via some substitution after diazotization. But I'm not fully sure.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 (aniline).
iii) CH3COCl → acylation. So, aniline is an activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would introduce the ketone. So, the acylation would occur in the meta position relative to the amine. Wait, but aniline is an ortho/para director. So, the ketone would be introduced ortho or para to the amine. Hmm, but then where would the nitro group end up?

Wait, maybe after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone. Then, we nitrate again. But I'm getting a bit lost here.

Another idea: maybe the correct sequence is to nitrate, then acylate, then brominate. But as I thought earlier, nitration deactivates the ring, making acylation difficult.

Wait, maybe the correct order is: acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

But after acylation and nitration, the ring is deactivating, so bromination would be difficult.

Wait, but perhaps introducing the nitro group after the acylation, then using a meta director. Let me think about that.

Okay, let's outline this:

1. Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (position 1: O=C-CH3).
2. Nitration: acetophenone is a meta director. So nitration would add nitro group at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.
3. Now, the ring has O=C-CH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3. Now, where to add Br?

The ring now has two meta directors: ketone and nitro. The next substitution (Br) would be directed by both. Since both are meta directors, the Br would go meta to both. But in a benzene ring, that might be position 5, which is meta to position 1 (ketone) and position 5 is adjacent to position 3 (nitro?), no, position 5 is two away from position 3.

Wait, let me imagine positions:

Positions 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), and 5 would be available.

Wait, if the ring has substituents at 1 and 3, the next substituent (Br) would go into which position? It's a matter of which directing effect is stronger. Both groups are meta directors, so the Br would enter into a position that's meta to both.

But in benzene, position 5 is meta to position 1 (since 1 to 3 to 5 is three positions away), but position 5 is adjacent to position 4, which is not substituted. Hmm, perhaps position 5 is the meta to the ketone (position 1), and the nitro at position 3 would direct ortho or para, but it's deactivating. So, Br might enter at position 5.

But how?

Wait, perhaps after acylation and nitration, the bromine can be introduced via an electrophilic substitution, but the ring is deactivated, making it difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine is introduced via a different method, like using a directing group or a coupling reaction, but that's beyond typical substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that Br could be introduced via a different mechanism, such as a coupling reaction, but I think the problem expects electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct option is option C.

Wait, looking at option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) CH3COCl → acylation with AlCl3 → acetophenone group added.
iv) Br2 → brominate.
v) HNO3 → nitrate again.
vi) NaNO2 → diazotization.
vii) H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone. Then, bromination would occur where? Since aniline is an activating group, it directs incoming groups to ortho and para. The ketone is a meta director.

So when brominating, the Br would go either ortho or para to the amine. But the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5, with ketone at 1. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after the acylation, you have the ketone at position 1, and the amine at position 4 (since aniline is position 1, and acylation occurs meta to it). Then, bromination would occur at position 3 (ortho to amine) or position 5 (para to amine), but I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So the nitro is at 5, which is meta to the ketone at 1, and the Br is at 3, which is meta to the nitro and ortho to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).
3. Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to nitro and ortho to ketone).

But how to get bromination to happen. Since after nitration, the ring has ketone (position 1) and nitro (position 5), both deactivating. So bromination would be difficult.

Alternatively, if I can find a way to re-activate the ring. Maybe by introducing a strong activating group, like -NH2.

Hmm, perhaps after nitration, I reduce the nitro group to an amine, which is activating. Then, acylation.

Wait, but that would change the order. Let's outline:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.
2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
3. Acylation → acetophenone. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so acylation would proceed. The acylation would add the ketone in the meta position relative to the amine.

So, after step 3, the ring has amine at 1 and ketone at 3.

4. Now, brominate → Br would go into ortho or para to the amine, which is at 1. So ortho would be 2, 6; para would be 4. But the target has Br at 3. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, after acylation, the ring has amine at 1 and ketone at 3. Then, brominating would add Br at 5 (meta to ketone and para to amine? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after acylation, the ring has amine at 1 and ketone at 3. Then, nitrate again → nitro would go meta to the ketone, which is position 6, but that's not what's needed.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium chloride.
iv) H3PO2 → perhaps this is the Stannous chloride reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to CH2Cl.

Wait, after step iv, the product would have the amine group replaced by something else. Maybe via a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, H3PO2 would cause the substitution of the diazonium group with a bromine, but I'm not sure.

Option D's steps after that: v) Br2 → brominate. vi) CH3COCl → acylation. vii) HNO3 → nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps this sequence would add substituents in the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Acylation → Nitration → Bromination.

But if I can't find a feasible option, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the target structure. The substituents are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, with the ketone at 1. So, the nitro is at 5, which is meta to the ketone, and the Br is at 3, which is meta to the nitro and ortho to the ketone.

So the order of introducing substituents would be:

1. Introduce the ketone (position 1) via acylation.
2. Introduce nitro (position 5) via nitration.
3. Introduce Br (position 3) via bromination.

But after steps 1 and 2, the ring is deactivated, so step 3 may not proceed. So perhaps we need to find a way to add the Br in a position that's activated.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the nitro group is in position 3, and the ketone in 1. Then, bromination would add Br in position 5.

But the steps would need to allow for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.

But after acylation, when you brominate, the Br goes to position 3. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and meta to Br.

Wait, let me think:

1. Acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).
3. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone and para to Br).

But wait, the nitro group would be directed by the ketone (meta) and perhaps the Br (ortho/para). But since Br is deactivating, nitration would prefer the position directed by the ketone.

So this sequence would produce the target structure.

Now, looking at the options, which option starts with acylation, followed by bromination, then nitration.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: i) acylate, ii) brominate, iii) nitrate. So steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. Then steps iv to vii are other things, but the first three steps are correct.

Wait, but option A's steps after that don't seem relevant. So perhaps option A's first three steps are correct, but the rest may not be needed.

Wait, the target molecule only has three substituents: ketone, Br, and nitro. So the steps after the first three in option A would be extra. Hmm, but that can't be; the product would require those steps.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the options.

Wait, option C's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) CH3COCl → acylate → acetophenone with amine.
iv) Br2 → brominate.
v) HNO3 → nitrate.
vi) NaNO2 → diazotize.
vii) H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone. Then, bromination would occur in a position directed by the amine (ortho or para). But the target requires Br at position 3, which is meta to the ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, because it starts with nitration, then reduction, then acylation, which would allow the ketone to be added in a position that's activated by the amine.

Wait, after nitration and reduction, you have aniline. Then, acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would introduce the ketone in the meta position relative to the amine. So, the ketone would be at position 3 if the amine is at position 1. Then, bromination would occur ortho or para to the amine, which is position 2, 4, or 6. But the target has Br at position 3, which is meta to the amine.

Hmm, that's not aligning. Maybe I'm still stuck.

Perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).
3. Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to nitro and ortho to ketone).

But how to get bromination to occur after nitration. Since the ring is deactivated, maybe we need to use a different method, like using a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that's not possible since the options are given.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C: The steps are i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) acylate, iv) brominate, v) nitrate, vi) diazotize, vii) H3PO2.

After nitrate and reduce, you have aniline (position 1: NH2). Then acylate: ketone goes meta to NH2, so position 4. Then brominate: Br would go ortho or para to NH2, i.e., positions 2, 4, or 6. But position 4 is already taken by the ketone.

Hmm, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps after acylation, the ring has NH2 at 1 and ketone at 4. Then, bromination would be at position 2, 4, or 6. Position 4 is taken, so Br at 2 or 6. Then, nitrate again: where?

This doesn't seem to lead to the desired product.

Another approach: Maybe the correct order is to nitrate first, then acylate, then brominate, but that's not working because ring is deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's the only one that introduces the nitro group in the correct position.

After multiple considerations, I think the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.
2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline (position 1: NH2).
3. Acylate → ketone at position 3 (meta to NH2).
4. Brominate → Br at position 5 (meta to ketone and para to NH2).
5. But then, perhaps another nitration step. Wait, this would add another nitro group, but the target has only one.

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe option C is correct because it includes steps that allow the groups to be added in the correct order.

Wait, another observation: the target molecule has two nitro groups? No, target has one nitro group and one Br. So any steps that add more nitro groups would be incorrect. Looking at the options, option D has two nitrations, which is incorrect.

So, the correct sequence should have only one nitration after the acylation. Looking, option A has two nitrations. Option B: two nitrations. Option C: two nitrations. Option D: two. That's not good.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The target has only one nitro group and one Br. So the options must have only one nitration and one bromination.

Looking again:

Option A: steps iii and v are nitrations. So two nitrations.

Option B: ii and iv. Two nitrations.

Option C: i and v. Two nitrations.

Option D: i and vii. Two nitrations.

Hmm, all options have two nitrations. That can't be right. But the target has only one nitro group, so this suggests that perhaps the steps involve substituting a nitro group with something else.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amine, then something else happens. Because then, the nitro wouldn't be present anymore.

Looking at option C: after nitration (step i), the next step is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing agent. So nitro group is reduced to amine (step ii). Then, acylation (step iii) adds ketone. Then, bromination (step iv). Then, nitration again (step v), which would add another nitro group. But the target has only one nitro. So option C would result in two nitro groups, which is wrong.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the nitration and bromination steps are in the correct order, and the acylation is the last step.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.
2. Brominate → Br at position 3 (meta to nitro).
3. Acylate → ketone at position 5 (meta to nitro and para to Br).

But after steps 1 and 2, the ring has nitro and Br, which are both deactivating. So acylation via Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So this sequence may not work.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct sequence should be: acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. Looking for an option that starts with acylation.

Looking at the options:

Option A starts with acylation (step i), then bromination (ii), then nitration (iii).

So steps:

i) acylation → ketone at 1.
ii) bromination → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).
iii) nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone and meta to Br).

But after that, the steps iv to vii are other reactions which I'm not sure about. But perhaps the product is formed after step iii, and the other steps are for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps in option A are for substituting or removing groups.

But the target molecule has only three substituents: ketone, Br, nitro. So maybe the other steps are for modifying or removing groups, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps option A's steps are not the right order.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So, the nitro is meta to the ketone and between the ketone and Br.

So, the acylation must come first to allow nitration and bromination in the correct positions.

Thus, the correct sequence would be acylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking for an option that follows this.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So bromination before nitration. That would place Br in position 3, then nitration would be in position 5 (meta to ketone). That would be correct.

So the steps in option A would yield the correct substituents.

Wait, but after step iii, the ring has all three substituents. Then, steps iv to vii are other reagents. Are they needed?

Hmm, but the target only requires these three groups. So perhaps steps iv to vii are for other purposes, like protecting groups or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option C is correct because it reduces the nitro group to an amine, allowing acylation to proceed.

But without further clarity, I'll have to choose the option that starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration, which is option A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone group first, as it is a meta-directing group and requires an activated aromatic ring for Friedel-Crafts acylation. Subsequent steps involve nitration and bromination in the correct positions relative to the ketone and other substituents.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Bromination adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
   - **Step iii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and meta to bromine).
   - This sequence aligns with the target structure, where the ketone is at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. The subsequent steps (iv–vii) may involve additional modifications but are not critical to achieving the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group, but the ring is already deactivated by bromine and nitro groups, making this step unlikely to proceed successfully.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group, but the amine is an ortho/para-directing activating group, which could lead to incorrect positioning of the ketone.
   - **Step iv**: Bromination and subsequent steps may not align with the desired positions for the substituents.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization and substitution may introduce bromine, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

### Conclusion:
Option A provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule. The ketone is introduced first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct positions relative to the ketone group. The subsequent steps in Option A may involve additional modifications but do not interfere with the formation of the target structure.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, this looks like a multi-step organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The substituents are a bromine and a nitro group, and there's also a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to a methyl group. So the ketone is on the benzene as a substituent, and the positions of the other groups (bromo and nitro) matter.

The target structure: Benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group in position 1. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is in position 1, then the positions 3 and 5 are meta and para to it. Let me visualize:

Position 1: ketone (O=C-CH3)
Position 3: Br
Position 5: NO2

So, the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So when we start with benzene, we need to introduce these groups in the correct order.

I remember that directing effects are crucial here. Nitro groups are meta directors, while bromine can be ortho/para but in substitution reactions, sometimes when it's a leaving group, it can have different behavior. The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta director.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduces the ketone group, benzene must be activated. Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts requires the aromatic ring to be activated, like having activating groups. But if I have a benzene ring with deactivating groups, I can't do Friedel-Crafts on it. So that suggests that the ketone group must be introduced early, before any deactivating groups are added. Because if I add nitro groups first, then the ring is deactivated, and Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

So, the plan should be: introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then bromine? Or perhaps another order?

Wait, the target has both nitro and bromine in the ring. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So, if I nitrate after the ketone, the nitro group would go into a meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would be next. But if the ring already has a nitro group, which is a strong meta director, and a ketone (also meta), how do new substituents get added?

Wait, maybe the order is: first introduce the ketone via Friedel-Crafts acylation, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, their directing effects can be a bit tricky. Let me think about each step.

Starting with benzene.

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene + CH3COCl, AlCl3 → acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So now, the ring has a ketone group, which is a meta director.

2. Nitration: next, we need to nitrate the ring. The nitro group will enter at the meta position relative to the ketone. Wait, the acetophenone has the ketone in position 1. So nitration would occur in position 3 or 5? Wait, the meta positions from the ketone would be positions 3 and 5. So where does nitro go? It should go into one of these positions. But since it's the first nitration, maybe it goes into position 3, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So when you have acetophenone, the positions are 2,4,6 as possible for substitution. Wait, no, the ketone is at position 1. So the possible positions for nitration are 3,4,5,6? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: acetophenone is benzene with a ketone at position 1. The nitro group is a meta director, but the ketone is also a meta director. So the nitro would enter in a position that's meta to the ketone. So that would be positions 3 or 5 relative to the ketone. But wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 3 and 5 are adjacent in a way. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituents and their directing effects. The ketone is a meta directing group, so when we nitrate, the nitro group will go into a position meta to the ketone. So, the first nitration would add nitro at position 3, then the next step would add bromine.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring becomes more deactivated. So, bromination via electrophilic substitution (like using Br2 with FeBr3) requires the ring to be activated. If the ring has a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, and a ketone, which is also deactivating, then the bromination might not proceed easily. So maybe bromination needs to happen before nitration?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because bromine, as a substituent, is a ortho/para director, but it's a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the -I effect). So bromine would deactivate the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce substituents in a way that allows the next reaction to proceed. Let me outline the possible steps.

Option 1: Introduce the ketone first. Then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is highly deactivated. So bromination would be difficult. So perhaps nitration can't happen after ketone and bromine.

Alternatively, maybe bromination is done first. But benzene doesn't brominate unless we have a catalyst. So, perhaps after introducing a group that activates the ring.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about each possible reaction step.

Looking at the options, each option is a sequence of steps. Let's analyze each option to see which makes sense.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduces the ketone. Then ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? Not sure. v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. vii) H3PO2 → what's that? H3PO2 is used in the Sandmeyer reaction, maybe, but I'm not certain. Hmm, this seems complex. So after two nitrations and two brominations, but I'm not sure.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate benzene to bromobenzene. Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. iv) HNO3 again. v) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step, like converting nitro to amine. vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. vii) H3PO2 → maybe a substitution reaction. Hmm, but after acylation, the ring is already deactivating. So nitration after acylation would be difficult, as the ring is deactivating, making electrophilic substitution harder.

Option C: i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene. Then ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine. iii) CH3COCl → acylation. Then iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. v) HNO3 → nitrate again. vi) NaNO2 → diazo. vii) H3PO2. Wait, nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is an activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would work. Then brominate. But wait, the product after acylation would have an aniline group? No, because after reduction, the nitro becomes NH2. Then Friedel-Crafts would introduce the ketone. But then bromination needs to happen in the ring that has both NH2 and ketone groups.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps after acylation, we have a ring with a ketone and a bromine.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first nitrate, then acylate, then brominate.

Wait, but nitration is a meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to the existing groups.

Wait, let's redo the target structure.

Target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene has:

Position 1: O=C-CH3 (since it's ethan-1-one)
Position 3: Br
Position 5: NO2

So, starting from benzene, let me figure out the order of substituent addition.

If I first introduce the ketone (Friedel-Crafts), then the ring has a meta-directing group. Then, nitration would add a nitro group in the meta position—so position 3 or 5 relative to the ketone. But then bromination would need to add another substituent in a specific position.

Wait, but perhaps the order is: first nitrate, then acylate, then brominate.

But the problem is that benzene is an electron-rich ring, so nitration is easy. Then, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work because the ring is deactivated. So that's a problem.

So perhaps the acylation must come first, before any deactivating groups are added.

So plan:

1. Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) → introduces ketone (meta director).
2. Nitration → adds nitro group meta to ketone (so at position 3 or 5). Let's say position 3.
3. Now, how to add bromine at position 5? Because after nitration, the ring has two substituents: ketone at 1, nitro at 3.

Wait, but if there are two substituents, their directing effects can influence each other. The nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. So when adding a new group, the positions would be influenced by both.

In this case, after acylation and nitration, the ring has groups at positions 1 (ketone) and 3 (nitro). The ketone is a meta director, the nitro is a meta director. So, the next substituent (bromine) would be added in a position that is meta to both.

Wait, but that's not possible because the ring is already occupied. So perhaps the next bromination would occur in a position that's meta to one and para to the other, depending on their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Maybe the bromine is introduced before nitration. But if I brominate benzene first, using FeBr3, then I have bromobenzene. Then, I can nitrate it. But bromobenzene's bromine is a meta director and deactivates the ring. So nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to bromine. So nitro at position 5. Then, after that, I can acylate.

Wait, let's see:

1. Benzene → brominate → bromobenzene (position 1: Br).
2. Bromobenzene → nitration → nitro group at position 3 (meta to Br).
3. Now, have Br at 1, nitro at 3. Now, acylation via Friedel-Crafts would introduce ketone. But wait, the ring is now deactivated with Br and nitro. Friedel-Crafts requires an active ring. So that's a problem. So this order won't work because the ring is too deactivated.

Hmm. So perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe introduce the groups that activate the ring after other substituents. But wait, nitro groups and bromine deactivate the ring. So the only activating group would be the ketone, but that's a deactivating group because it's electron-withdrawing.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the nitro group first, then the ketone, then bromine. But again, nitro deactivates the ring, making acylation difficult.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introduce the ketone, then bromine, then nitration. Let's think:

1. Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (position 1: ketone).
2. Then, brominate. Since the ketone is a meta director, bromine would go into position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.
3. Now, acetophenone with Br at 3. Now, need to nitrate. The ring already has two substituents: ketone (1) and Br (3). The nitro group would have to go into a position that's activated. But the ring is deactivated because of the ketone and Br, which are deactivating. So nitration might not be feasible.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should look at the possible options and see which sequence aligns with the target structure.

Let me review the options again.

Option C: steps are HNO3 → Fe/HCl → CH3COCl → Br2 → HNO3 → etc. Let's see.

Option C:
i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.
iii) CH3COCl → acylation. So now, we have aniline (from reduction) and acylation would add ketone. Wait, but aniline is an activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would work. But wait, then you have a benzene ring with an amine and a ketone. Then, iv) Br2 → brominate. V) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Wait, but after acylation, the ring has an amine group and a ketone. The amine is an activating group (ortho/para director), but the ketone is deactivating (meta). So the next substitution would be directed by both. Maybe the bromine goes into a position influenced by both.

But this seems complicated. Let's think about the overall product.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other. So, the substituents are all meta to each other.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.
2. Brominate (using FeBr3) → Br would go to position 3 (meta to nitro).
3. Then acylation. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so acylation (Friedel-Crafts) won't work.

Hmm, that can't be. So alternative approach: Let me think about the substituent order. The ketone is position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then nitro, then Br. But as I thought earlier, after ketone and nitro, the ring is too deactivated for Br to add.

Another approach: Maybe the nitro group is introduced after the Br. Let's see:

1. Benzene → acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Then, brominate → Br at 3.
3. Now, the ring has ketone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director, but deactivating). So, when nitrating, where would the nitro group go?

Hmm, the nitro group is a strong meta director, but the ring is already deactivated. So nitration might not occur. Or perhaps the Br is an ortho/para director, but deactivating, and the ketone is a meta director. So the nitro group would go into a position that's meta to the ketone, but perhaps the Br is in a position that directs it elsewhere.

This is getting too confusing. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.
ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at meta to Br (so position 5, if Br is at 1).
iii) CH3COCl → acylation. But wait, bromobenzene is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option B's steps seem problematic because after bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acylation can't proceed.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → N2+Cl-.
iv) H3PO2 → Sandmeyer reaction? H3PO2 is used for the Clemmensen reduction (which reduces ketones to CH2 groups, but that's not this), or maybe for the Mitsunobu reaction, not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 can be used in the presence of a copper catalyst for the substitution of diazonium salts with halides, which might introduce a Br or Cl.

Wait, but in this option, after nitration and reduction, we have aniline. Then, maybe the next step is acylation.

Wait, let's see:

Option D's steps: i) nitrate, ii) reduce nitro to amine, iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride, iv) H3PO2 → perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by something.

But wait, H3PO2 is usually used in the presence of a base for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to CH2Cl groups, but I might be mixing it up.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, H3PO2 would substitute it with a bromine via the Sandmeyer reaction, but that uses CuX and HX. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are introducing bromine via some substitution after diazotization. But I'm not fully sure.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 (aniline).
iii) CH3COCl → acylation. So, aniline is an activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would introduce the ketone. So, the acylation would occur in the meta position relative to the amine. Wait, but aniline is an ortho/para director. So, the ketone would be introduced ortho or para to the amine. Hmm, but then where would the nitro group end up?

Wait, maybe after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone. Then, we nitrate again. But I'm getting a bit lost here.

Another idea: maybe the correct sequence is to nitrate, then acylate, then brominate. But as I thought earlier, nitration deactivates the ring, making acylation difficult.

Wait, maybe the correct order is: acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

But after acylation and nitration, the ring is deactivating, so bromination would be difficult.

Wait, but perhaps introducing the nitro group after the acylation, then using a meta director. Let me think about that.

Okay, let's outline this:

1. Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (position 1: O=C-CH3).
2. Nitration: acetophenone is a meta director. So nitration would add nitro group at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.
3. Now, the ring has O=C-CH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3. Now, where to add Br?

The ring now has two meta directors: ketone and nitro. The next substitution (Br) would be directed by both. Since both are meta directors, the Br would go meta to both. But in a benzene ring, that might be position 5, which is meta to position 1 (ketone) and position 5 is adjacent to position 3 (nitro?), no, position 5 is two away from position 3.

Wait, let me imagine positions:

Positions 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), and 5 would be available.

Wait, if the ring has substituents at 1 and 3, the next substituent (Br) would go into which position? It's a matter of which directing effect is stronger. Both groups are meta directors, so the Br would enter into a position that's meta to both.

But in benzene, position 5 is meta to position 1 (since 1 to 3 to 5 is three positions away), but position 5 is adjacent to position 4, which is not substituted. Hmm, perhaps position 5 is the meta to the ketone (position 1), and the nitro at position 3 would direct ortho or para, but it's deactivating. So, Br might enter at position 5.

But how?

Wait, perhaps after acylation and nitration, the bromine can be introduced via an electrophilic substitution, but the ring is deactivated, making it difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine is introduced via a different method, like using a directing group or a coupling reaction, but that's beyond typical substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that Br could be introduced via a different mechanism, such as a coupling reaction, but I think the problem expects electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct option is option C.

Wait, looking at option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) CH3COCl → acylation with AlCl3 → acetophenone group added.
iv) Br2 → brominate.
v) HNO3 → nitrate again.
vi) NaNO2 → diazotization.
vii) H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone. Then, bromination would occur where? Since aniline is an activating group, it directs incoming groups to ortho and para. The ketone is a meta director.

So when brominating, the Br would go either ortho or para to the amine. But the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5, with ketone at 1. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after the acylation, you have the ketone at position 1, and the amine at position 4 (since aniline is position 1, and acylation occurs meta to it). Then, bromination would occur at position 3 (ortho to amine) or position 5 (para to amine), but I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So the nitro is at 5, which is meta to the ketone at 1, and the Br is at 3, which is meta to the nitro and ortho to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).
3. Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to nitro and ortho to ketone).

But how to get bromination to happen. Since after nitration, the ring has ketone (position 1) and nitro (position 5), both deactivating. So bromination would be difficult.

Alternatively, if I can find a way to re-activate the ring. Maybe by introducing a strong activating group, like -NH2.

Hmm, perhaps after nitration, I reduce the nitro group to an amine, which is activating. Then, acylation.

Wait, but that would change the order. Let's outline:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.
2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
3. Acylation → acetophenone. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so acylation would proceed. The acylation would add the ketone in the meta position relative to the amine.

So, after step 3, the ring has amine at 1 and ketone at 3.

4. Now, brominate → Br would go into ortho or para to the amine, which is at 1. So ortho would be 2, 6; para would be 4. But the target has Br at 3. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, after acylation, the ring has amine at 1 and ketone at 3. Then, brominating would add Br at 5 (meta to ketone and para to amine? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after acylation, the ring has amine at 1 and ketone at 3. Then, nitrate again → nitro would go meta to the ketone, which is position 6, but that's not what's needed.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium chloride.
iv) H3PO2 → perhaps this is the Stannous chloride reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to CH2Cl.

Wait, after step iv, the product would have the amine group replaced by something else. Maybe via a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, H3PO2 would cause the substitution of the diazonium group with a bromine, but I'm not sure.

Option D's steps after that: v) Br2 → brominate. vi) CH3COCl → acylation. vii) HNO3 → nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps this sequence would add substituents in the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Acylation → Nitration → Bromination.

But if I can't find a feasible option, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the target structure. The substituents are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, with the ketone at 1. So, the nitro is at 5, which is meta to the ketone, and the Br is at 3, which is meta to the nitro and ortho to the ketone.

So the order of introducing substituents would be:

1. Introduce the ketone (position 1) via acylation.
2. Introduce nitro (position 5) via nitration.
3. Introduce Br (position 3) via bromination.

But after steps 1 and 2, the ring is deactivated, so step 3 may not proceed. So perhaps we need to find a way to add the Br in a position that's activated.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the nitro group is in position 3, and the ketone in 1. Then, bromination would add Br in position 5.

But the steps would need to allow for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.

But after acylation, when you brominate, the Br goes to position 3. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and meta to Br.

Wait, let me think:

1. Acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).
3. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone and para to Br).

But wait, the nitro group would be directed by the ketone (meta) and perhaps the Br (ortho/para). But since Br is deactivating, nitration would prefer the position directed by the ketone.

So this sequence would produce the target structure.

Now, looking at the options, which option starts with acylation, followed by bromination, then nitration.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: i) acylate, ii) brominate, iii) nitrate. So steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. Then steps iv to vii are other things, but the first three steps are correct.

Wait, but option A's steps after that don't seem relevant. So perhaps option A's first three steps are correct, but the rest may not be needed.

Wait, the target molecule only has three substituents: ketone, Br, and nitro. So the steps after the first three in option A would be extra. Hmm, but that can't be; the product would require those steps.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the options.

Wait, option C's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.
iii) CH3COCl → acylate → acetophenone with amine.
iv) Br2 → brominate.
v) HNO3 → nitrate.
vi) NaNO2 → diazotize.
vii) H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone. Then, bromination would occur in a position directed by the amine (ortho or para). But the target requires Br at position 3, which is meta to the ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, because it starts with nitration, then reduction, then acylation, which would allow the ketone to be added in a position that's activated by the amine.

Wait, after nitration and reduction, you have aniline. Then, acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would introduce the ketone in the meta position relative to the amine. So, the ketone would be at position 3 if the amine is at position 1. Then, bromination would occur ortho or para to the amine, which is position 2, 4, or 6. But the target has Br at position 3, which is meta to the amine.

Hmm, that's not aligning. Maybe I'm still stuck.

Perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acylation → ketone at 1.
2. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).
3. Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to nitro and ortho to ketone).

But how to get bromination to occur after nitration. Since the ring is deactivated, maybe we need to use a different method, like using a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that's not possible since the options are given.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C: The steps are i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) acylate, iv) brominate, v) nitrate, vi) diazotize, vii) H3PO2.

After nitrate and reduce, you have aniline (position 1: NH2). Then acylate: ketone goes meta to NH2, so position 4. Then brominate: Br would go ortho or para to NH2, i.e., positions 2, 4, or 6. But position 4 is already taken by the ketone.

Hmm, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps after acylation, the ring has NH2 at 1 and ketone at 4. Then, bromination would be at position 2, 4, or 6. Position 4 is taken, so Br at 2 or 6. Then, nitrate again: where?

This doesn't seem to lead to the desired product.

Another approach: Maybe the correct order is to nitrate first, then acylate, then brominate, but that's not working because ring is deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's the only one that introduces the nitro group in the correct position.

After multiple considerations, I think the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.
2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline (position 1: NH2).
3. Acylate → ketone at position 3 (meta to NH2).
4. Brominate → Br at position 5 (meta to ketone and para to NH2).
5. But then, perhaps another nitration step. Wait, this would add another nitro group, but the target has only one.

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe option C is correct because it includes steps that allow the groups to be added in the correct order.

Wait, another observation: the target molecule has two nitro groups? No, target has one nitro group and one Br. So any steps that add more nitro groups would be incorrect. Looking at the options, option D has two nitrations, which is incorrect.

So, the correct sequence should have only one nitration after the acylation. Looking, option A has two nitrations. Option B: two nitrations. Option C: two nitrations. Option D: two. That's not good.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The target has only one nitro group and one Br. So the options must have only one nitration and one bromination.

Looking again:

Option A: steps iii and v are nitrations. So two nitrations.

Option B: ii and iv. Two nitrations.

Option C: i and v. Two nitrations.

Option D: i and vii. Two nitrations.

Hmm, all options have two nitrations. That can't be right. But the target has only one nitro group, so this suggests that perhaps the steps involve substituting a nitro group with something else.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amine, then something else happens. Because then, the nitro wouldn't be present anymore.

Looking at option C: after nitration (step i), the next step is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing agent. So nitro group is reduced to amine (step ii). Then, acylation (step iii) adds ketone. Then, bromination (step iv). Then, nitration again (step v), which would add another nitro group. But the target has only one nitro. So option C would result in two nitro groups, which is wrong.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the nitration and bromination steps are in the correct order, and the acylation is the last step.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.
2. Brominate → Br at position 3 (meta to nitro).
3. Acylate → ketone at position 5 (meta to nitro and para to Br).

But after steps 1 and 2, the ring has nitro and Br, which are both deactivating. So acylation via Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So this sequence may not work.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct sequence should be: acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. Looking for an option that starts with acylation.

Looking at the options:

Option A starts with acylation (step i), then bromination (ii), then nitration (iii).

So steps:

i) acylation → ketone at 1.
ii) bromination → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).
iii) nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone and meta to Br).

But after that, the steps iv to vii are other reactions which I'm not sure about. But perhaps the product is formed after step iii, and the other steps are for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps in option A are for substituting or removing groups.

But the target molecule has only three substituents: ketone, Br, nitro. So maybe the other steps are for modifying or removing groups, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps option A's steps are not the right order.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So, the nitro is meta to the ketone and between the ketone and Br.

So, the acylation must come first to allow nitration and bromination in the correct positions.

Thus, the correct sequence would be acylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking for an option that follows this.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So bromination before nitration. That would place Br in position 3, then nitration would be in position 5 (meta to ketone). That would be correct.

So the steps in option A would yield the correct substituents.

Wait, but after step iii, the ring has all three substituents. Then, steps iv to vii are other reagents. Are they needed?

Hmm, but the target only requires these three groups. So perhaps steps iv to vii are for other purposes, like protecting groups or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option C is correct because it reduces the nitro group to an amine, allowing acylation to proceed.

But without further clarity, I'll have to choose the option that starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration, which is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone group first, as it is a meta-directing group and requires an activated aromatic ring for Friedel-Crafts acylation. Subsequent steps involve nitration and bromination in the correct positions relative to the ketone and other substituents.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Bromination adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
   - **Step iii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and meta to bromine).
   - This sequence aligns with the target structure, where the ketone is at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. The subsequent steps (iv–vii) may involve additional modifications but are not critical to achieving the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group, but the ring is already deactivated by bromine and nitro groups, making this step unlikely to proceed successfully.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group, but the amine is an ortho/para-directing activating group, which could lead to incorrect positioning of the ketone.
   - **Step iv**: Bromination and subsequent steps may not align with the desired positions for the substituents.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization and substitution may introduce bromine, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

### Conclusion:
Option A provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule. The ketone is introduced first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct positions relative to the ketone group. The subsequent steps in Option A may involve additional modifications but do not interfere with the formation of the target structure.
