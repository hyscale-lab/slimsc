Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I remember that these reactions usually involve a benzene ring reacting with an electrophile. The question gives six substances, each is a benzene derivative with a substituent, and I need to figure out the order of their para-isomer yield from highest to lowest, or wait, no, the question says "increasing" order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I need to arrange them from the one with the smallest para yield to the largest.

Wait, wait. The problem says, "substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed." Wait, bromine in electrophilic substitution? Oh, right, bromine can act as the electrophile, so it's adding a bromine atom to the ring.

But when you have a benzene ring with substituents, the position where the bromine adds depends on the activating or deactivating nature of the substituent and whether it's ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.

So each substituent in the given compounds will influence where the bromine adds. The question is about the para-isomer's yield. I need to determine which substituent directs the incoming Br+ to the para position better, leading to a higher yield of the para product.

Wait, but actually, the weight fraction of the para-isomer would depend on the directing effects. So, the more activating the substituent is, the more it directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. But some substituents are deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive but still directs in certain ways.

Wait, let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethyl ester)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, no, wait. The structures are:

1) C6H5-CH3 → that's toluene, a methyl group attached to benzene.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → that's phenyl ester, an ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl → chlorobenzene.

4) C6H5-NO2 → nitrobenzene.

5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl benzene.

6) C6H5-COOH → benzoic acid.

Now, I need to think about the directing effects of each substituent.

Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's ortho/para-directing. When the substituent is activating, the ring is more reactive, and the incoming electrophile (Br+) is added to ortho and para positions. So the major product would be para, but the reaction could form both ortho and para, with para being more favorable due to less steric hindrance.

COOEt (ester group): An ester is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's deactivating. Also, since it's an electron-withdrawing group, the substituent is meta-directing. Wait, wait, the ester group is an activating or deactivating? No, wait, ester groups are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta-directing. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, substituents can be either activating (like -NH2, -O-) or deactivating (like -NO2, -COOH). Esters (like -COOR) are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing.

So, the substituent in compound 2 is deactivating and meta-directing. That would mean that when Br+ attacks, it's more likely to substitute at the meta position relative to the ester group. So the para product would be less favored here.

Wait, but wait, for substituents like -COOR (ester), they are ortho/para-directing but deactivating. Hmm, no, wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, let me think again. The directing effect is based on the substituent's ability to donate or withdraw electrons. Electron-donating groups activate the ring and are ortho/para-directing. Electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and are meta-directing, except for nitro groups, which are strong deactivating and ortho/para-directing? No, wait, no. Wait, nitro groups are meta-directing. Let me get this straight.

Wait, substituents can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

- Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -R) are activating (they increase the rate of electrophilic substitution) and are ortho/para directors. So the incoming group goes to ortho or para positions.

- Electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -COR) are deactivating (slow down the reaction) and are meta directors. So the incoming group goes to meta positions.

Wait, but sometimes groups like -X (halogens) are a bit tricky. Chlorine is a deactivating (due to inductive effect) but ortho/para-directing because of the lone pairs on Cl providing some resonance. So Cl is deactivating but ortho/para.

Let me list each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para.

2) COOEt: deactivating, because of the carbonyl. So meta-directing.

3) Cl: deactivating (since it's more electronegative, inductive effect), but ortho/para-directing because of resonance.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta-directing.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): similar to CH3. Activating, ortho/para.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta-directing.

Wait, but wait, does COOH direct meta? Yes, as it's a strong electron-withdrawing group. So meta.

So, now, each substituent directs the incoming Br+ to specific positions.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So if a substituent directs more to para, the para product will have a higher yield.

But wait, for each substituent, whether it's ortho/para or meta-directing will determine where the Br goes. For meta-directing, the Br will go meta to the substituent. So for a meta director, the para product would not be formed, right? Because the substituent is at position 1, Br goes to position 3 (meta). So the product would have Br at meta, so no para product. Wait, but wait, in that case, the para product's yield would be zero for meta-directing groups.

Wait, but the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, that can't be right because for some substituents, like methyl, we can get two products: ortho and para. But the question states that only one monobromo is formed. Wait, perhaps that's a bit confusing. Wait, but the setup says that "only one monobromo derivative is formed", but that seems contradictory unless all substitution leads to the same product. Wait, but that doesn't make sense unless the substituent is such that only a single product is possible. Hmm, perhaps I've misread the question.

Wait, let's re-read the question. It says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh! Wait, perhaps all the brominations lead to a single product, meaning that the substituent is such that only one position is possible for substitution. For example, if the substituent is in a position where only one product is possible, like if the substituent is in such a way that the ring is highly activated in only one position. Wait, but that's not the case for any of these substituents.

Wait, perhaps the question is that each substituent leads to a single brominated product, but that can't be right. For instance, a benzene with a methyl group can brominate in ortho, meta, or para, but in reality, para is major, ortho is minor, and meta is negligible because methyl is activating and orhto/para.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the bromine is in excess, so all possible positions are filled, but the question says only one monobromo product is formed. Hmm, maybe each substituent leads to only one possible product because of the substituent's directing effect. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the bromine adds in a specific position, but I need to arrange them based on the ratio of the para product. Wait, perhaps the para product is the major one for some substituents, and the question is about the percentage of para in each case.

But the question is asking for the order of increasing weight fraction. So from the substituent that gives the lowest para yield to the highest.

Wait, but for substituents that are meta-directing, the para product won't form, right? Because the substituent directs the electrophile to the meta position, so the Br would be at meta, making the product at meta. So para product's yield would be zero. Wait, but for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product would form, but for meta directors, the para product is zero.

Wait, but wait, the substituent in question 2 is COOEt, which is a meta director. So the Br would go meta, making the product at meta. So the para product would be negligible, maybe zero.

Likewise for NO2 (question 4), which is meta director, so Br would go meta, so the para product is zero.

COOH (question 6) is meta director, so para product is zero.

Cl (question 3) is ortho/para, so Br can go ortho or para, but perhaps para is more favored because of less steric hindrance.

Wait, but wait, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is more favored than ortho because the steric hindrance is less. So for such substituents, the major product is para.

So the para product yield depends on how strong the activating effect is and how much the substituent directs.

Wait, but some substituents may have a strong activating effect, making the ortho product more than others? Or is it that the para is always major?

Wait, in the case of methyl group (question 1), which is a strong activating group, the para product is major.

Similarly, ethyl group (question 5), same as methyl.

But for substituents like Cl (question 3), which is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. So the ring isn't as reactive, but the substituent directs the Br to ortho and para. So the para product may be major.

Wait, but I think that the para product is generally more favored than ortho for activating groups because the substituent is in one position, and the para has less steric hindrance.

So, let me list each substituent and the effect on para yield:

1) CH3 (activating, ortho/para): high para yield.

2) COOEt (deactivating, meta): para yield is zero or negligible.

3) Cl (deactivating, ortho/para): para is major but ring is less reactive.

4) NO2 (deactivating, meta): para yield zero.

5) C2H5 (activating, ortho/para): high para.

6) COOH (deactivating, meta): para yield zero.

Wait, but what about for substituents that are activating? For example, methyl and ethyl. Both are activating, so the para product is major. But what about the relative strength? How does the activating effect influence the yield of para?

Wait, the activating groups increase the rate of reaction, but the direction is ortho/para. So the para product is major. So, for substituents like methyl and ethyl, the para product's yield is high, but perhaps the more activating the substituent, the higher the para yield.

Wait, but methyl and ethyl are both activating, so maybe their para yields are similar. Or perhaps the more bulky substituent (like ethyl) would have more ortho product because of steric hindrance. Wait, methyl is less bulky than ethyl. Oh, wait, no, ethyl is bulkier. So in ethyl benzene, the para product might be more favored than the ortho because the ethyl group is bulkier, making the ortho position less accessible. So, perhaps, ethyl substituent leads to lower ortho and higher para compared to methyl, which has less steric hindrance, so more ortho?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. For substituents that are bulky, like a tert-butyl group, the para product is favored because the ortho positions are hindered. So for a methyl group, which is less bulky, the ortho product is more accessible, so the ortho/para ratio is higher in ortho compared to a bulkier substituent.

So, for ethyl group (question 5), which is bulkier than methyl, the para product would be more favored than ortho. Thus, the weight fraction of para would be higher for ethyl benzene than for toluene.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Maybe I should think about the relative activating strengths and the steric effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the para yield is higher when the substituent is more activating, as the reaction is faster, leading to more para product. But wait, the activating groups just make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution but don't directly affect the ratio of ortho to para, which is more influenced by steric factors.

Wait, perhaps substituents that are electron-donating and less bulky lead to more ortho substitution, while bulky groups lead to more para substitution.

So, methyl is less bulky, so ortho is more favored than para. Wait, but I thought for methyl, para is the major product. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of specific examples. For toluene, what's the major product when brominated?

I remember that toluene (methyl benzene) undergoes bromination to give a mixture, but the para product is major, ortho is minor, and meta is negligible. So, the para product's yield is higher.

Similarly, ethyl benzene would have a major para product, but perhaps with even higher para yield than toluene because ethyl is bulkier, leading to less ortho substitution.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the more bulky the substituent, the more para product is formed because the ortho positions are harder to reach.

So, substituents 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl) are activating, ortho/para directors.

Between them, ethyl is bulkier, so substituent 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl).

So for the para yield, substituent 5 would have higher than 1.

Similarly, substituent 3 (Cl) is ortho/para directing but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs to ortho and para.

But since Cl is deactivating, the para product would be the major one, but the overall reaction may be slower. However, the question is about the weight fraction of para, irrespective of the overall reactivity.

So, for substituent 3, the para product would be major.

Now, substituents 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), and 6 (COOH) are meta directors. So their para product would be negligible, maybe zero.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the substituents that are meta directors would have a para yield of zero, while those that are ortho/para directors would have varying yields.

So, the substituents 1,3,5 would have some para yield, while 2,4,6 would have none.

So, the order of increasing para yield would be: substituents 2,4,6 (zero or very low) < substituents 1,3,5 (with some para yield, but in what order?).

Wait, but the options given don't have all the substituents with zero para. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

So the substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, which would have low para yield. So in the order of increasing para yield, these would be at the lower end.

Now, the order would have meta directors (2,4,6) first, followed by the ortho/para directors (1,3,5). But within the ortho/para directors, the order depends on their ability to direct to para.

So, the ortho/para directors would have varying para yields. Which of these substituents leads to a higher para yield?

Substituent 3 is Cl, which is a deactivating, ortho/para director. Since the ring is less reactive, perhaps the para product is more favored than ortho because steric effects are less. But wait, Cl is a deactivating group, so the reaction is slower. But the question is about the proportion, not the absolute yield.

Wait, but when a substituent is deactivating and ortho/para directing, the para product is still major, just that the overall reaction is slower.

So, substituent 3 (Cl) would have a para product, but in lower proportion compared to activating substituents. Wait, no, the proportion between para and ortho is more about the substituent's directing effect than activating strength.

Wait, perhaps activating substituents have a higher tendency to form para products because the ring is more reactive, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the directing effect is independent of activating or deactivating, but the activation affects the rate.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the order of the para product yield is as follows:

The substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) have the least para yield (zero), so they come first in the order.

Among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the substituents with stronger activating groups (i.e., more electron-donating) would have higher para yields because the ring is more reactive, and the para product is major, but the activating groups may lead to a higher proportion of para as compared to substituents that are less activating.

Wait, but wait, activating groups increase the rate of reaction but don't necessarily affect the ratio of ortho to para. The ratio is determined more by steric factors.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach this differently.

Each substituent's effect on the para product's yield:

- For meta-directing groups (2,4,6): para yield is 0 or negligible. So, their order among themselves depends on perhaps other factors, but it's all the same, they are zero. But the answer options have them in a certain order.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group (4) is a strong deactivating group. So, in nitrobenzene, the bromine is more likely to add in the meta position, but if it does add in the para, how much would it be? Actually, I think that for meta-directing groups, the para product is not formed. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, meta-directing groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. So, the product would have Br in the meta position relative to the substituent. So, the para product's yield would be zero in that case.

So, substituents 2,4,6 have para yield zero.

Therefore, in the order of increasing para yield, these would be the first three, but how?

Wait, but the options don't include any substituent with zero yield for all meta directors. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituents can have varying degrees of directing. For example, some groups may have a slight tendency to direct to para, even if they're meta directors.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing the substituents' directing effects.

Let me re-examine each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta.

3) Cl: deactivating, ortho/para (because Cl is a special case, being a deactivating but ortho/para director.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta.

5) C2H5: activating, ortho/para.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta.

So, substituents 3 is ortho/para, others are meta.

So, the para product's yield is only significant for substituent 3.

Wait, but substituent 1 and 5 are activating, so they're ortho/para directors, so their para yield is significant.

Wait a minute! Oh! I think I messed up earlier. So substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors, and 2,4,6 are meta directors.

So substituents 1,3,5 would have para products, and 2,4,6 would have meta products, meaning their para yield is zero.

So, for the purpose of the question, which asks for the order of weight fraction of para-isomer, substances 2,4,6 have zero, and 1,3,5 have varying amounts.

So, the order would have 2,4,6 as the lowest (zero), followed by the others.

But wait, the question is about "increasing" order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, lowest first.

So, the correct order would be: 2,4,6 < 1,3,5.

But among 1,3,5, which has higher para yield? Let's think.

Substituent 1: CH3, activating, ortho/para director. So, para product is major.

Substituent 3: Cl, deactivating, but ortho/para. So, para product is major but the ring is less reactive.

Substituent 5: C2H5, activating, ortho/para.

So, for the para yield, the activating substituents (1 and 5) would have a higher para product yield than substituent 3, which is deactivating.

So, the order among 1,3,5 is 3 < 1 <5.

Wait, no. Because substituents with stronger activating effects would have higher para yields. So, substituent 5 (C2H5) is more activating than 1 (CH3)? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, methyl and ethyl are both activating, but perhaps ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl because of more alkyl groups donating electrons. Or wait, no, alkyl groups are all activating. So, perhaps their directing effects are similar, but steric effects differ.

Wait, for substituent 5 (ethyl), which is bulkier than methyl, the ortho product is less favored due to steric hindrance, leading to a higher para yield compared to substituent 1 (methyl), which is less bulky and allows more ortho substitution.

So, the para yield would be in the order: substituent 5 (ethyl) > substituent 1 (methyl) > substituent 3 (Cl).

Wait, that makes sense because Cl is deactivating and may lead to lower para yields compared to activating groups.

Wait, but wait, Cl is deactivating, so even though it's an ortho/para director, the ring is less reactive, but once the bromine adds, the para product would be major.

So, perhaps substituent 3's para yield is higher than substituents 2,4,6, but lower than 1 and 5.

So, putting it all together, the order would be:

Substituents 2,4,6 (para yield 0) < substituent 3 < substituent 1 < substituent 5.

Wait, but substituent 5 would have the highest para yield, followed by 1, then 3.

But in the options, the substituents are mixed in the order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm, let me see.

Wait, according to my analysis, substituents 2,4,6 have zero para yield, then comes 3, then 1, then 5.

So, the order from lowest para to highest would be: 2,4,6 < 3 < 1 <5.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. So the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, the product is mostly para. So substituent 3's para product's weight fraction would be higher than substituents 2,4,6, which have zero. But substituents 1 and 5, being activating, would have higher para yields than 3.

So the order would be:

Lowest (zero): 2,4,6

Then, substituent 3: which has para yield higher than zero.

Then, substituent 1 (methyl): high para.

Then substituent 5 (ethyl): highest para.

So the order from least to most para yield is 2,4,6 < 3 < 1 <5.

But the options don't have substituents 2,4,6 in the same group.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → this suggests substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → no, that's not matching.

Wait, but earlier I thought that substituents 2,4,6 all have zero para. So in the options, how are they arranged?

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

This would mean substituent 4 has the lowest, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But if substituents 4,2,6 have zero, then the order among them might be based on other factors, but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating group, making the reaction with Br2 the least favorable. But that affects the overall yield, not the ratio of para to ortho.

Alternatively, substituent 4 is a meta director, so para product is zero.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe another approach: let's think about the activating/deactivating and the directing effects.

The meta directors (2,4,6) have the least para product. The ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have varying para yields, with substituents 1 and 5 having higher yields than 3.

So, the order from least to most para yield is:

2,4,6 < 3 < 1 <5.

Therefore, substituents 2,4,6 have the least, then 3, then 1, then 5 has the highest.

Now, looking at the options, which option reflects this order? Let's check.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → Here, 4 is first, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But according to our analysis, 2,4,6 should all be before 3. But in option A, 4 and 2 and 6 are in the first three positions, which fits. Then comes 3, then 1, then 5.

So the order in option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But wait, in my analysis, substituent 6 is COOH, which is a meta director, so its para yield is zero. Similarly for 2 and 4. So in option A, substituent 4 is first (lowest para), then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So according to that, substituents 4,2,6 are in the lowest group, followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

But among substituents 2,4,6, which has the least para yield? All have zero, but perhaps their overall reactivity affects their position.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction, not the overall yield.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that substituent 3 (Cl) is ortho/para but deactivating. So, the para product would have a certain yield, but less than substituents 1 and 5.

So, perhaps the order is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but substituent 4 is NO2, which is a strong deactivating group, so perhaps in substitution reactions, the bromination is least favored (but the para product is zero, so it's the same as others in the meta group). So, the order would be substituents 4,2,6 in the lowest, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So option A is 4 < 2 < 6 <3 <1 <5.

So, the order would be option A.

But another thought: substituent 6 (COOH) is a stronger deactivating group than substituent 2 (COOEt). So perhaps substituent 6 has even less para yield than 2 and 4, but since all are zero, their order doesn't matter.

Wait, but in the options, option A has substituent 4 before 2 before 6, which is perhaps based on the substituent's deactivating strength. But since all are meta directors, their para yields are zero.

So, perhaps the correct order is substituent 4 < 2 < 6 <3 <1 <5. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either be activating or deactivating and can direct the incoming electrophile to ortho/para or meta positions. The para-isomer's yield depends on these directing effects and steric factors.

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing. Methyl is a strong electron-donating group, leading to a high para-isomer yield due to steric hindrance reducing ortho substitution.
2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester)**: Deactivating, meta-directing. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group directs the electrophile to the meta position, resulting in negligible para-isomer yield.
3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**: Deactivating, ortho/para-directing. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group but has lone pairs that allow ortho/para direction. However, the para-isomer is favored due to steric hindrance, though the overall reactivity is lower.
4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro)**: Deactivating, meta-directing. The nitro group strongly withdraws electrons and directs the electrophile to the meta position, resulting in negligible para-isomer yield.
5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing. Ethyl is bulkier than methyl, leading to a higher para-isomer yield due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions.
6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic Acid)**: Deactivating, meta-directing. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group directs the electrophile to the meta position, resulting in negligible para-isomer yield.

### Order of Para-Isomer Yield:
- **Meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6)**: These substituents result in negligible para-isomer yield (effectively zero), so they occupy the lowest positions in the order.
- **Ortho/para-directing groups (1, 3, 5)**: These substituents produce a significant para-isomer yield. Among them:
  - **C6H5-Cl (3)**: Deactivating, so the para-isomer yield is lower than for activating groups.
  - **C6H5-CH3 (1)**: Activating, with a high para-isomer yield.
  - **C6H5-C2H5 (5)**: Activating and bulkier than methyl, leading to the highest para-isomer yield.

### Final Order:
From lowest to highest para-isomer yield:  
**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
