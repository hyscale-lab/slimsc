Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think.

First, the problem states that Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form Compound B. Bromination in CCl4 usually refers to an addition reaction, probably in alkenes. Wait, but what is Compound A? C3H6 could be propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. Oh wait, no, propene is C3H6 because 3 carbons, each double bond reduces two H's. So, C3H6 is either cyclopropane or propene. Wait, but cyclopropane is C3H6 as well. Hmm, but for addition reactions, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would make more sense because cyclopropane is more strained and less reactive towards addition. So, I'll assume Compound A is propene.

So, when propene (CH2=CHCH3) undergoes bromination in CCl4, it's an addition reaction. The bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond. Propene has one double bond, so adding Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, actually, the addition of bromine to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So, Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, this reaction is likely an elimination reaction. When a dihalide reacts with a strong base, it usually undergoes dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,2-dibromopropane with KOH in alcohol would eliminate to form an alkene. Since the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form propene again. Wait, but wait—if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, when KOH removes one Br, it would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving back propene. So, Compound C would be propene. But wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination could lead to either propene or another structure? Hmm, no, I think it's propene again, leading to the same structure as A.

Wait, but wait—could it form another isomer? Propene only has one structure. So, Compound C is propene. But wait, the reaction is elimination, so maybe it's a different product. No, I think it's propene because that's the only possible product when you eliminate the two Brs from 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, producing Compound D. Red-hot iron usually leads to dehydrogenation reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alkanes. Wait, but Compound C is propene, which is an alkene. What happens when an alkene is passed over iron? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, wait—another thought. Maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let's double-check.

Wait, no, let's think again. If Compound A is propene, adding Br2 gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, we eliminate HBr twice to form back propene. So, Compound C is propene. But then, when passed through a red-hot iron tube, what would that do? Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is cyclopropane. Let me reconsider.

Wait, if Compound A is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. Then, bromination in CCl4—wait, cyclopropane is a strained ring, so maybe it would undergo substitution? Or perhaps bromination isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, cyclopropane can undergo bromination as an electrophilic addition, opening the ring. So, adding Br2 would open the cyclopropane ring. So, cyclopropane (C3H6) reacting with Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane. So, same as before.

Wait, okay, maybe whether A is propene or cyclopropane depends on the next steps. Let's think. When Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination gives back propene. So, Compound C is propene. Then, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube—maybe this is a dehydrogenation reaction. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. What's the next step after that?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reactions. Another possibility is that the red-hot iron is used for breaking double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another thought: Maybe after elimination, Compound C is not propene but something else. Let me think again. If Compound C is propene, and it's passed over red-hot iron, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction? No, because that would require H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe the iron is causing some kind of decomposition. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's go through each step and see.

1. A → B: Bromination of C3H6 with Br2 in CCl4 → likely addition across double bond if it's an alkene. So, if A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

2. B → C: Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination. So, 1,2-dibromopropane → propene via E2 elimination.

3. C → D: Passing through red-hot iron → might lead to dehydrogenation. But propene is already unsaturated. Wait, maybe the reaction is to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the process is for converting alkenes to alkanes, but that would need hydrogenation, which usually requires H2 and a catalyst, not red-hot iron.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: when propene (C) is passed over red-hot iron, it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but what product would that give? Dehydrogenation of propene would give something less saturated. Wait, propene has a double bond; dehydrogenation would require more unsaturation, which isn't possible. So, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway is different. Let me think again. Maybe A is cyclopropane, and when brominated, it becomes 1,2-dibromocyclopropane? No, wait, adding Br2 to cyclopropane would open the ring. So, cyclopropane (3-membered ring) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is a straight chain with two adjacent Brs.

So, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, KOH elimination gives propene again (C is propene). Then, when propene is passed through red-hot iron—it's possible that it's dehydrogenating to form something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when propene is passed over red-hot iron, it's undergoing a different kind of reaction. Wait, what if this is a process of converting an alkene to an alkyne? Because sometimes, dehydrohalogenation can form alkynes, but that usually requires multiple eliminations. Alternatively, maybe this is a process where multiple dehydrogenations occur. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for the formation of benzene rings, but that doesn't fit here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward. Let's assume that after passing through red-hot iron, D is formed. Let's think about the product.

Assuming that D is something like acetylene. How? Let me think: propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3. If we remove a hydrogen from each of the two adjacent carbons, perhaps forming a triple bond. So, CH2=CHCH3 → CH≡C-CH3? No, that's impossible because you can't have a triple bond between C1 and C2 with only two carbons. Wait, no. Acetylene would be C2H2, but we have three carbons. So, maybe forming propyne, which is HC≡C-CH3. Hmm. How? Let's see: If we eliminate two Hs from propene, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation again, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the red-iron process is for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds via some catalytic process. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product D is benzene? No, but that would require a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about Compound C. Let me think, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

If Compound A is cyclopropane, then bromination would add Br2 across the ring, breaking it into a di-substituted product. Let's say, 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination with KOH would give back cyclopropane, but that's unlikely. Wait, no, elimination would form an alkene, not a cyclopropane. So, maybe if you have 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form propene. So, Compound C is propene. Then, D is formed by passing propene through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, what else can happen? Wait, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction, but that would require H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the formation of benzene via dehydrogenation, but propene has only one double bond. It would need to lose H2 to form a triple bond or a ring, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, maybe D is propane, but that would require hydrogenation, which I don't think is happening here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next steps and see if that helps. So, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Then, E reacts with iron and HCl to form F. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Wait, if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then reacting it with two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric acid—to form a nitrated product? Or perhaps a sulfonation. Or maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction. Alternatively, perhaps D is propene, and the mixture of two strong acids is for a different purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Then, reacting benzene with a mixture of two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) would produce nitrobenzene (if nitrated) or sulfonic acid (if sulfonated). But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the third step. Let me think again about the options.

Another approach: let's think about each product and the options given.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR.

Option D: C is a flammable gas.

So, let's see which of these statements are incorrect.

First, let's try to figure out what each compound is.

Starting with Compound A: C3H6.

Assuming it's propene (CH2=CHCH3), bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B).

Alcoholic KOH eliminates to form propene (C), which is a flammable gas. So, Option D says C is a flammable gas, which would be correct because propene is a gas and flammable. So, D is correct as a statement.

Then, C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then what happens next?

Propyne reacting with a mixture of strong acids. Let's say concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3. Would that lead to nitration? Propyne is an alkyne; nitration typically occurs on aromatic rings. So, maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with the strong acids is for sulfonation. But propyne isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if D is benzene, then reacting with two strong acids would be nitrating or sulfonating. But how does propene passing over red-hot iron become benzene? That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the formation of D.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe after elimination, Compound C is propane (if the starting material was cyclopropane). Wait, no, that doesn't fit because elimination from dihalide would give an alkene, not an alkane.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the red-hot iron is causing a decomposition of propene. But I can't think of a reaction where propene would decompose into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about B. Let's reevaluate.

If A is propene, then B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives propene (C). Then, D is formed by passing propene through red-hot iron. Another possibility: perhaps D is propane. How? If propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with red-hot iron, maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction, adding H2 to form propane. But I don't think red-hot iron provides H2. Unless the iron is acting as a catalyst for something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the process is the dehydrohalogenation of 1,2-dibromopropane, but no, that would be for B to form C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that after elimination, C is propane, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's suppose that Compound D is propane (C3H8). Then, D would react with two strong acids. But what reaction would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let me think about the next steps.

Suppose D is propane, and it's treated with a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe it's a sulfonation and nitration. But propane doesn't have an aromatic ring, so that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the other parts of the question.

Compound E is formed from D when treated with two strong acids. Then, E reacts with iron and HCl to form F. F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, which when treated with NaOH gives H.

Assuming that D is benzene, then E could be nitrobenzene or toluene sulfonic acid. If E is nitrobenzene, then reaction with Fe and HCl (maybe in a reduction) would form aniline (F). Then, aniline (F) would react with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form a diazonium salt (G), which then reacts with NaOH to give a phenol (H). So, H would be phenol. Phenol reacts with FeCl3 to give a reddish-brown color, so option B says H gives yellow with ferric chloride. But phenol gives a brown color, so option B would be incorrect. But I'm not sure if this pathway is right.

Alternatively, let's consider another pathway. Suppose D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, when reacted with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydration reaction. Propyne can be hydrolyzed to form ketones, but with strong acids, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the strong acids are for nitrating or sulfonating, but propyne isn't an aromatic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps D is acetone. How? If propene is passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's oxidized to form acetone. Wait, oxidation of propene (CH2=CHCH3) with a catalyst could form acetone (propan-2-one). So, D would be acetone.

Then, D (acetone) reacts with two strong acids. Maybe it's a nitrile formation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are for removing functional groups. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture of strong acids is for sulfonation. Acetone has a ketone group; sulfonation typically occurs at the carbonyl group. So, D (acetone) would react with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form a sulfonated product, maybe acetone sulfonic acid.

Then, E is this sulfonic acid. Then, E reacts with iron and HCl to form F. Hmm, but what reaction would that be? Maybe a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the final options again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline, then it's correct because aniline derivatives are used in dye synthesis.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is phenol, then it would give a brown color, so option B would be incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is acetone, its structure is (CH3)2CO. The two CH3 groups would each be a singlet. So, acetone's NMR would show a singlet for the two methyl groups. Wait, but in that case, there's only one singlet, not two. So, if D is acetone, option C is incorrect.

Hmm, but wait, if D is something else, like propyne, its NMR would have different peaks. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) has two sets of protons: the terminal H (which is a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent C≡C group) and the CH3 as a singlet. Wait, but wait, the CH3 in propyne is a singlet. So, only one singlet. So, if D is propyne, the 1H NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 and perhaps another peak for the H on the triple bond.

Alternatively, if D is propene, its structure is CH2=CHCH3. The protons on CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So, no singlets. So, if option C says D gives two singlets, that would be incorrect if D is propene.

Wait, but let me go back. Let's think about each step again, maybe I made a wrong assumption.

1. A is C3H6. Let's assume it's propene (CH2=CHCH3).

2. Bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait: propene adds Br2 as Br-CH2-CH2-Br? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. No, wait, that's not correct. The correct addition is across the double bond, so the product is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. The bromine adds across the double bond, so each Br attaches to adjacent carbons. So, it would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, but that would be 1,2-dibromopropane. No, wait, the structure would actually be BrCH2-CH2Br-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no. When Br2 adds to propene, it adds across the double bond. So, the structure becomes CH2Br-CH2BrCH3? No, that's not possible. Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2Br-CH2BrCH3. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br to each carbon of the double bond, resulting in BrCH2-CH2BrCH3? No, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the correct addition would be BrCH2CHBrCH3. Wait, no, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, adding Br to each would give BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. So, that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination of HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane. So, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. The first elimination would lose one HBr, forming a double bond. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen? Wait, no, with a dihalide, the elimination would occur once, removing both Brs as one HBr per Br. So, the product would be propene again. So, Compound C is propene.

4. Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. I'm not sure about this step. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form another alkene, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps this is a process to form an alkyne. So, perhaps D is propyne (HC≡C-CH3).

5. Compound D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Propyne is an alkyne. Strong acids might be for nitrating, but alkyne nitration is possible. Alternatively, perhaps the acids are for hydration. Propyne can be hydrated in acidic conditions to form ketones. So, with H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalyst, propyne would hydrate to form acetone (propan-2-one). So, E would be acetone.

6. Compound E (acetone) reacts with iron and HCl to form F. What reaction is this? Iron and HCl might be a reducing environment. Acetone (CH3)2CO could undergo some kind of reduction. Maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Fe as a catalyst. So, acetone would reduce to propane (CH3CH2CH3). So, F is propane.

7. Compound F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Wait, but propane doesn't have an amino group. Nitrous acid usually reacts with amines or amides. So, maybe F is something else. Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps F is something else. Let me think again. After E is acetone, reaction with Fe and HCl—could it be a different reaction? Maybe a Grignard reaction? No, because Fe and HCl is more like a reducing environment.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. If D is propyne and E is not acetone, but another product. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with two strong acids is a sulfonation. So, propyne could be sulfonated to form a sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and then E is something else.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to think about the options again.

Option C says D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then the structure has a terminal H and a CH3 group. The H on the triple bond would be a singlet because it's on a sp-hybridized carbon and has no neighboring protons. The CH3 would also be a singlet as it's attached to the triple bond and its three protons are equivalent. So, in the NMR, D would have two singlets. So, option C would be correct if D is propyne.

Alternatively, if D is acetone, then the (CH3)2CO has two CH3 groups, each a singlet. So, acetone's NMR would show one singlet integrating for six protons (the two CH3 groups). So, in that case, option C is incorrect because only one singlet is present.

Hmm. Let's think about which product D is. If D is propyne, then option C is correct. If D is acetone, option C is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought D might be propyne. But then, when E is formed from D with two strong acids, I'm not sure what E would be. If D is propyne, and E is formed by reacting with two strong acids, perhaps it's a nitration. But alkyne nitration is possible, but I'm not sure of the product.

Alternatively, perhaps E is propyl nitrate or something else, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe D is propane. Propane's NMR would have a singlet for the three CH3 groups, so only one singlet. So, option C would be incorrect if D is propane.

But earlier steps don't lead to propane. Hmm.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, it's unlikely. Propane is a fuel, not used in dyes. But if F is aniline, then it is used in dyes. So, if F is aniline, option A is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is phenol, it gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect. But if H is something else, maybe a different color.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. If D is propyne, which has two singlets, option C is correct. If D is acetone, which has one singlet, option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable, so option D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be either option B or C, depending on what D is.

But the question says, which statement is incorrect. So, among the options, one is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: think about the reactions leading to each product.

If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then E would be formed by reaction with two strong acids. What reaction occurs when an alkyne reacts with strong acids? Maybe hydration to form a ketone. So, E would be acetone. Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Maybe this is a Clemmensen reduction, reducing the ketone to propane. So, F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, but propane doesn't have any functional group to react with nitrous acid. So, maybe this pathway is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a sulfonic acid, and F is something else. I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, maybe D is benzene. Then, E is nitrobenzene. F would be aniline, formed by reduction of nitrobenzene. Then, F (aniline) reacts with nitrous acid at low temps to form a diazonium salt (G). Then, G is treated with NaOH to form phenol (H), which gives a brown color with FeCl3. So, option B would say H gives yellow, which is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe H is something else, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the initial steps don't support D being benzene. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Another angle: looking at the options, option C says D gives two singlets. Let's suppose D is propyne. Then, propyne's NMR would have two singlets: the H on the triple bond (a singlet) and the CH3 group (a singlet). So, option C is correct.

If that's the case, then the incorrect option would be elsewhere. Let's see the other options.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is phenol, it gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect.

But if H is something else, like salicylic acid, which gives a yellow color, maybe option B is correct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Let me think about the steps.

After F is formed, it reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is aniline, then reacting with nitrous acid (at low temps) forms a diazonium chloride (G). Then, treating G with NaOH (aqueous) would give phenol (H). Phenol reacts with FeCl3 to give a brown color, so option B is incorrect because it says yellow.

Alternatively, if H is o-nitrophenol or something else, maybe it gives a different color. But I think phenol gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect.

But I thought earlier that option B is incorrect, but I'm not certain if H is phenol.

Alternatively, perhaps F is something else. If F is propane, then reacting with nitrous acid would do nothing, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps F is aniline, which would make H phenol.

In that case, option B is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is assumed to be propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH eliminates HBr, regenerating propene (Compound C), which is a flammable gas, making Option D correct.

When propene (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation or dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH₃), which is Compound D. Propyne has two distinct sets of protons: the terminal H on the triple bond and the CH₃ group. Both sets appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum, making Option C correct.

Compound D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely undergoing hydration to form acetone (CH₃COCH₃), which is Compound E. Acetone reacts with iron and hydrochloric acid in a Clemmensen reduction, reducing the ketone group to form propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃), which is Compound F. Propane does not react with nitrous acid, so this step appears inconsistent with the given sequence.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, and G reacts with NaOH to form H. If H is phenol, it would give a brown color with FeCl₃, but Option B states that H gives a yellow color. This contradicts the expected behavior of phenol, making Option B incorrect.

Option A states that F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect, as propane is not used in dye synthesis. However, if F is aniline, it is indeed used in dye synthesis, making Option A correct.

The incorrect statement is Option B, as phenol gives a brown color with FeCl₃, not yellow.

Answer: B

Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think.

First, the problem states that Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form Compound B. Bromination in CCl4 usually refers to an addition reaction, probably in alkenes. Wait, but what is Compound A? C3H6 could be propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. Oh wait, no, propene is C3H6 because 3 carbons, each double bond reduces two H's. So, C3H6 is either cyclopropane or propene. Wait, but cyclopropane is C3H6 as well. Hmm, but for addition reactions, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would make more sense because cyclopropane is more strained and less reactive towards addition. So, I'll assume Compound A is propene.

So, when propene (CH2=CHCH3) undergoes bromination in CCl4, it's an addition reaction. The bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond. Propene has one double bond, so adding Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, actually, the addition of bromine to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So, Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, this reaction is likely an elimination reaction. When a dihalide reacts with a strong base, it usually undergoes dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,2-dibromopropane with KOH in alcohol would eliminate to form an alkene. Since the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form propene again. Wait, but wait—if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, when KOH removes one Br, it would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving back propene. So, Compound C would be propene. But wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination could lead to either propene or another structure? Hmm, no, I think it's propene again, leading to the same structure as A.

Wait, but wait—could it form another isomer? Propene only has one structure. So, Compound C is propene. But wait, the reaction is elimination, so maybe it's a different product. No, I think it's propene because that's the only possible product when you eliminate the two Brs from 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, producing Compound D. Red-hot iron usually leads to dehydrogenation reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alkanes. Wait, but Compound C is propene, which is an alkene. What happens when an alkene is passed over iron? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, wait—another thought. Maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let's double-check.

Wait, no, let's think again. If Compound A is propene, adding Br2 gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, we eliminate HBr twice to form back propene. So, Compound C is propene. But then, when passed through a red-hot iron tube, what would that do? Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is cyclopropane. Let me reconsider.

Wait, if Compound A is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. Then, bromination in CCl4—wait, cyclopropane is a strained ring, so maybe it would undergo substitution? Or perhaps bromination isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, cyclopropane can undergo bromination as an electrophilic addition, opening the ring. So, adding Br2 would open the cyclopropane ring. So, cyclopropane (C3H6) reacting with Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane. So, same as before.

Wait, okay, maybe whether A is propene or cyclopropane depends on the next steps. Let's think. When Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination gives back propene. So, Compound C is propene. Then, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube—maybe this is a dehydrogenation reaction. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. What's the next step after that?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reactions. Another possibility is that the red-hot iron is used for breaking double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another thought: Maybe after elimination, Compound C is not propene but something else. Let me think again. If Compound C is propene, and it's passed over red-hot iron, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction? No, because that would require H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe the iron is causing some kind of decomposition. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's go through each step and see.

1. A → B: Bromination of C3H6 with Br2 in CCl4 → likely addition across double bond if it's an alkene. So, if A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

2. B → C: Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination. So, 1,2-dibromopropane → propene via E2 elimination.

3. C → D: Passing through red-hot iron → might lead to dehydrogenation. But propene is already unsaturated. Wait, maybe the reaction is to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the process is for converting alkenes to alkanes, but that would need hydrogenation, which usually requires H2 and a catalyst, not red-hot iron.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: when propene (C) is passed over red-hot iron, it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but what product would that give? Dehydrogenation of propene would give something less saturated. Wait, propene has a double bond; dehydrogenation would require more unsaturation, which isn't possible. So, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway is different. Let me think again. Maybe A is cyclopropane, and when brominated, it becomes 1,2-dibromocyclopropane? No, wait, adding Br2 to cyclopropane would open the ring. So, cyclopropane (3-membered ring) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is a straight chain with two adjacent Brs.

So, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, KOH elimination gives propene again (C is propene). Then, when propene is passed through red-hot iron—it's possible that it's dehydrogenating to form something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when propene is passed over red-hot iron, it's undergoing a different kind of reaction. Wait, what if this is a process of converting an alkene to an alkyne? Because sometimes, dehydrohalogenation can form alkynes, but that usually requires multiple eliminations. Alternatively, maybe this is a process where multiple dehydrogenations occur. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for the formation of benzene rings, but that doesn't fit here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward. Let's assume that after passing through red-hot iron, D is formed. Let's think about the product.

Assuming that D is something like acetylene. How? Let me think: propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3. If we remove a hydrogen from each of the two adjacent carbons, perhaps forming a triple bond. So, CH2=CHCH3 → CH≡C-CH3? No, that's impossible because you can't have a triple bond between C1 and C2 with only two carbons. Wait, no. Acetylene would be C2H2, but we have three carbons. So, maybe forming propyne, which is HC≡C-CH3. Hmm. How? Let's see: If we eliminate two Hs from propene, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation again, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the red-iron process is for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds via some catalytic process. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product D is benzene? No, but that would require a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about Compound C. Let me think, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

If Compound A is cyclopropane, then bromination would add Br2 across the ring, breaking it into a di-substituted product. Let's say, 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination with KOH would give back cyclopropane, but that's unlikely. Wait, no, elimination would form an alkene, not a cyclopropane. So, maybe if you have 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form propene. So, Compound C is propene. Then, D is formed by passing propene through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, what else can happen? Wait, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction, but that would require H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the formation of benzene via dehydrogenation, but propene has only one double bond. It would need to lose H2 to form a triple bond or a ring, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, maybe D is propane, but that would require hydrogenation, which I don't think is happening here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next steps and see if that helps. So, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Then, E reacts with iron and HCl to form F. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Wait, if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then reacting it with two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric acid—to form a nitrated product? Or perhaps a sulfonation. Or maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction. Alternatively, perhaps D is propene, and the mixture of two strong acids is for a different purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Then, reacting benzene with a mixture of two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) would produce nitrobenzene (if nitrated) or sulfonic acid (if sulfonated). But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the third step. Let me think again about the options.

Another approach: let's think about each product and the options given.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR.

Option D: C is a flammable gas.

So, let's see which of these statements are incorrect.

First, let's try to figure out what each compound is.

Starting with Compound A: C3H6.

Assuming it's propene (CH2=CHCH3), bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B).

Alcoholic KOH eliminates to form propene (C), which is a flammable gas. So, Option D says C is a flammable gas, which would be correct because propene is a gas and flammable. So, D is correct as a statement.

Then, C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then what happens next?

Propyne reacting with a mixture of strong acids. Let's say concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3. Would that lead to nitration? Propyne is an alkyne; nitration typically occurs on aromatic rings. So, maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with the strong acids is for sulfonation. But propyne isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if D is benzene, then reacting with two strong acids would be nitrating or sulfonating. But how does propene passing over red-hot iron become benzene? That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the formation of D.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe after elimination, Compound C is propane (if the starting material was cyclopropane). Wait, no, that doesn't fit because elimination from dihalide would give an alkene, not an alkane.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the red-hot iron is causing a decomposition of propene. But I can't think of a reaction where propene would decompose into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about B. Let's reevaluate.

If A is propene, then B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives propene (C). Then, D is formed by passing propene through red-hot iron. Another possibility: perhaps D is propane. How? If propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with red-hot iron, maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction, adding H2 to form propane. But I don't think red-hot iron provides H2. Unless the iron is acting as a catalyst for something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the process is the dehydrohalogenation of 1,2-dibromopropane, but no, that would be for B to form C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that after elimination, C is propane, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's suppose that Compound D is propane (C3H8). Then, D would react with two strong acids. But what reaction would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let me think about the next steps.

Suppose D is propane, and it's treated with a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe it's a sulfonation and nitration. But propane doesn't have an aromatic ring, so that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the other parts of the question.

Compound E is formed from D when treated with two strong acids. Then, E reacts with iron and HCl to form F. F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, which when treated with NaOH gives H.

Assuming that D is benzene, then E could be nitrobenzene or toluene sulfonic acid. If E is nitrobenzene, then reaction with Fe and HCl (maybe in a reduction) would form aniline (F). Then, aniline (F) would react with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form a diazonium salt (G), which then reacts with NaOH to give a phenol (H). So, H would be phenol. Phenol reacts with FeCl3 to give a reddish-brown color, so option B says H gives yellow with ferric chloride. But phenol gives a brown color, so option B would be incorrect. But I'm not sure if this pathway is right.

Alternatively, let's consider another pathway. Suppose D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, when reacted with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydration reaction. Propyne can be hydrolyzed to form ketones, but with strong acids, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the strong acids are for nitrating or sulfonating, but propyne isn't an aromatic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps D is acetone. How? If propene is passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's oxidized to form acetone. Wait, oxidation of propene (CH2=CHCH3) with a catalyst could form acetone (propan-2-one). So, D would be acetone.

Then, D (acetone) reacts with two strong acids. Maybe it's a nitrile formation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are for removing functional groups. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture of strong acids is for sulfonation. Acetone has a ketone group; sulfonation typically occurs at the carbonyl group. So, D (acetone) would react with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form a sulfonated product, maybe acetone sulfonic acid.

Then, E is this sulfonic acid. Then, E reacts with iron and HCl to form F. Hmm, but what reaction would that be? Maybe a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the final options again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline, then it's correct because aniline derivatives are used in dye synthesis.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is phenol, then it would give a brown color, so option B would be incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is acetone, its structure is (CH3)2CO. The two CH3 groups would each be a singlet. So, acetone's NMR would show a singlet for the two methyl groups. Wait, but in that case, there's only one singlet, not two. So, if D is acetone, option C is incorrect.

Hmm, but wait, if D is something else, like propyne, its NMR would have different peaks. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) has two sets of protons: the terminal H (which is a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent C≡C group) and the CH3 as a singlet. Wait, but wait, the CH3 in propyne is a singlet. So, only one singlet. So, if D is propyne, the 1H NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 and perhaps another peak for the H on the triple bond.

Alternatively, if D is propene, its structure is CH2=CHCH3. The protons on CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So, no singlets. So, if option C says D gives two singlets, that would be incorrect if D is propene.

Wait, but let me go back. Let's think about each step again, maybe I made a wrong assumption.

1. A is C3H6. Let's assume it's propene (CH2=CHCH3).

2. Bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait: propene adds Br2 as Br-CH2-CH2-Br? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. No, wait, that's not correct. The correct addition is across the double bond, so the product is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. The bromine adds across the double bond, so each Br attaches to adjacent carbons. So, it would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, but that would be 1,2-dibromopropane. No, wait, the structure would actually be BrCH2-CH2Br-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no. When Br2 adds to propene, it adds across the double bond. So, the structure becomes CH2Br-CH2BrCH3? No, that's not possible. Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2Br-CH2BrCH3. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br to each carbon of the double bond, resulting in BrCH2-CH2BrCH3? No, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the correct addition would be BrCH2CHBrCH3. Wait, no, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, adding Br to each would give BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. So, that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination of HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane. So, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. The first elimination would lose one HBr, forming a double bond. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen? Wait, no, with a dihalide, the elimination would occur once, removing both Brs as one HBr per Br. So, the product would be propene again. So, Compound C is propene.

4. Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. I'm not sure about this step. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form another alkene, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps this is a process to form an alkyne. So, perhaps D is propyne (HC≡C-CH3).

5. Compound D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Propyne is an alkyne. Strong acids might be for nitrating, but alkyne nitration is possible. Alternatively, perhaps the acids are for hydration. Propyne can be hydrated in acidic conditions to form ketones. So, with H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalyst, propyne would hydrate to form acetone (propan-2-one). So, E would be acetone.

6. Compound E (acetone) reacts with iron and HCl to form F. What reaction is this? Iron and HCl might be a reducing environment. Acetone (CH3)2CO could undergo some kind of reduction. Maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Fe as a catalyst. So, acetone would reduce to propane (CH3CH2CH3). So, F is propane.

7. Compound F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Wait, but propane doesn't have an amino group. Nitrous acid usually reacts with amines or amides. So, maybe F is something else. Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps F is something else. Let me think again. After E is acetone, reaction with Fe and HCl—could it be a different reaction? Maybe a Grignard reaction? No, because Fe and HCl is more like a reducing environment.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. If D is propyne and E is not acetone, but another product. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with two strong acids is a sulfonation. So, propyne could be sulfonated to form a sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and then E is something else.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to think about the options again.

Option C says D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then the structure has a terminal H and a CH3 group. The H on the triple bond would be a singlet because it's on a sp-hybridized carbon and has no neighboring protons. The CH3 would also be a singlet as it's attached to the triple bond and its three protons are equivalent. So, in the NMR, D would have two singlets. So, option C would be correct if D is propyne.

Alternatively, if D is acetone, then the (CH3)2CO has two CH3 groups, each a singlet. So, acetone's NMR would show one singlet integrating for six protons (the two CH3 groups). So, in that case, option C is incorrect because only one singlet is present.

Hmm. Let's think about which product D is. If D is propyne, then option C is correct. If D is acetone, option C is incorrect.

But earlier, I thought D might be propyne. But then, when E is formed from D with two strong acids, I'm not sure what E would be. If D is propyne, and E is formed by reacting with two strong acids, perhaps it's a nitration. But alkyne nitration is possible, but I'm not sure of the product.

Alternatively, perhaps E is propyl nitrate or something else, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe D is propane. Propane's NMR would have a singlet for the three CH3 groups, so only one singlet. So, option C would be incorrect if D is propane.

But earlier steps don't lead to propane. Hmm.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, it's unlikely. Propane is a fuel, not used in dyes. But if F is aniline, then it is used in dyes. So, if F is aniline, option A is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is phenol, it gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect. But if H is something else, maybe a different color.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. If D is propyne, which has two singlets, option C is correct. If D is acetone, which has one singlet, option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable, so option D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be either option B or C, depending on what D is.

But the question says, which statement is incorrect. So, among the options, one is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: think about the reactions leading to each product.

If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then E would be formed by reaction with two strong acids. What reaction occurs when an alkyne reacts with strong acids? Maybe hydration to form a ketone. So, E would be acetone. Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Maybe this is a Clemmensen reduction, reducing the ketone to propane. So, F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, but propane doesn't have any functional group to react with nitrous acid. So, maybe this pathway is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a sulfonic acid, and F is something else. I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, maybe D is benzene. Then, E is nitrobenzene. F would be aniline, formed by reduction of nitrobenzene. Then, F (aniline) reacts with nitrous acid at low temps to form a diazonium salt (G). Then, G is treated with NaOH to form phenol (H), which gives a brown color with FeCl3. So, option B would say H gives yellow, which is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe H is something else, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the initial steps don't support D being benzene. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Another angle: looking at the options, option C says D gives two singlets. Let's suppose D is propyne. Then, propyne's NMR would have two singlets: the H on the triple bond (a singlet) and the CH3 group (a singlet). So, option C is correct.

If that's the case, then the incorrect option would be elsewhere. Let's see the other options.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is phenol, it gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect.

But if H is something else, like salicylic acid, which gives a yellow color, maybe option B is correct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Let me think about the steps.

After F is formed, it reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is aniline, then reacting with nitrous acid (at low temps) forms a diazonium chloride (G). Then, treating G with NaOH (aqueous) would give phenol (H). Phenol reacts with FeCl3 to give a brown color, so option B is incorrect because it says yellow.

Alternatively, if H is o-nitrophenol or something else, maybe it gives a different color. But I think phenol gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect.

But I thought earlier that option B is incorrect, but I'm not certain if H is phenol.

Alternatively, perhaps F is something else. If F is propane, then reacting with nitrous acid would do nothing, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps F is aniline, which would make H phenol.

In that case, option B is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is option B.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is assumed to be propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH eliminates HBr, regenerating propene (Compound C), which is a flammable gas, making Option D correct.

When propene (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation or dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH₃), which is Compound D. Propyne has two distinct sets of protons: the terminal H on the triple bond and the CH₃ group. Both sets appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum, making Option C correct.

Compound D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely undergoing hydration to form acetone (CH₃COCH₃), which is Compound E. Acetone reacts with iron and hydrochloric acid in a Clemmensen reduction, reducing the ketone group to form propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃), which is Compound F. Propane does not react with nitrous acid, so this step appears inconsistent with the given sequence.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, and G reacts with NaOH to form H. If H is phenol, it would give a brown color with FeCl₃, but Option B states that H gives a yellow color. This contradicts the expected behavior of phenol, making Option B incorrect.

Option A states that F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect, as propane is not used in dye synthesis. However, if F is aniline, it is indeed used in dye synthesis, making Option A correct.

The incorrect statement is Option B, as phenol gives a brown color with FeCl₃, not yellow.

Answer: B
