Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. So that's a state vector, right? But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually supposed to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that. 

The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the squares are 1²=1, 2²=4, and 1²=1. Wait, no, wait—the absolute values. So |-1|² is 1, |2|² is 4, |1|² is 1. Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized to 1. So I guess I need to normalize it before proceeding. 

So the norm is sqrt(6), right? So each component should be divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector becomes [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. Okay, that makes sense. 

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P as given. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, I think I should double-check that. So row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Yep, that's correct.

The question is to find the probability that measuring P yields 0. 

Hmm. So in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible results are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude (absolute value squared) of the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue in the state vector.

So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me think. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues.

So let's set up the matrix P - λI. Each diagonal element becomes (P_ii - λ). 

So P - λI is:
[
    [-λ, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ].

Wait, because the third element in the first row is zero, the third term in the expansion will be zero. So I can ignore that. Let's compute each part.

First term: (-λ) multiplied by the determinant of the 2x2 matrix in the bottom right. That's:

| -λ   1/√2 |
|1/√2  -λ   |

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2) 

Second term: minus (1/√2) times the determinant of the minor matrix. The minor for the [1,2] element (second column, first row) is:

|1/√2  1/√2|
|0      -λ  |

Wait, no. When expanding along the first row, for the second element (which is 1/√2), the minor is the matrix you get by removing the first row and second column. So the minor matrix is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So, row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], but without column 2, so [1/√2, 1/√2]. Similarly, row 3 is [0, 1/√2, -λ], without column 2, so [0, -λ].

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. The minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix that remains after removing row 1 and column 2. So:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So row 2 becomes [1/√2, 1/√2], row 3 becomes [0, -λ].

Wait, no. Wait, the original matrix after removing row 1 and column 2 is:

Row 2 becomes [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] without the second element (so [1/√2, 1/√2])? No, wait, the original matrix is:

P - λI:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

So when we remove row 1 and column 2, the minor is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2] (columns 1 and 3)
Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the minor matrix is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0,    -λ   ]

The determinant of this is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ / sqrt(2)).

So the second term in the expansion is: 

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 

Wait no, the expansion is:

det = a11*A11 + a12*A12 + a13*A13

Where A12 is the cofactor, which is (-1)^(1+2) * minor determinant.

So for the (1,2) element, A12 = (-1)^(3) * minor determinant = - (minor determinant).

So the second term is a12 * A12 = (1/√2) * [ - minor determinant ]

The minor determinant for (1,2) is the determinant of the minor matrix, which I found as (-λ / sqrt(2)).

So the cofactor is - ( -λ / sqrt(2) ) ) = λ / sqrt(2).

Wait, maybe I got this wrong. Let me think again.

The cofactor expansion for the first row is:

sum_{j=1 to 3} (a_ij * C_ij)

Where C_ij is (-1)^(i+j) * M_ij, and M_ij is the minor determinant.

So for j=2, i=1: C_12 = (-1)^(3) * M_12 = - * [ determinant of the minor ]

So M_12 is the determinant of the minor matrix when removing row 1 and column 2.

Which is the matrix:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0,    -λ ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = - λ / sqrt(2)

So C_12 = (-1)^(3) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = λ/sqrt(2)

So the second term is a12 * C_12 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2)) ) = (λ) / 2.

So the determinant is:

First term: (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2 )

Second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * ( - [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ) - (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ] ) * (-1) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed systematically. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant of P - λI.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see.

Wait, looking at matrix P, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix, which suggests that its eigenvectors are orthogonal, and it has real eigenvalues. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator or something else that might have known eigenvalues.

Wait, looking at P, let's see if it's a Hermitian matrix. Because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

P is real and symmetric, so it's Hermitian. So yes, P is Hermitian, so it has real eigenvalues.

So the eigenvalues are real.

But perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the trace and determinant to find possible eigenvalues.

The trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. So 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Wait, P's diagonal elements are 0,0,0. So trace is 0. The sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P can be calculated. Let me compute det(P).

Wait, P is the matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Calculating the determinant of P:

Using the first row for expansion, since it has a zero which can simplify things.

det(P) = 0 * minor - (1/sqrt(2)) * minor + 0 * minor.

So the minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So submatrix is:

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2 would be:

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 0 ]

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that.

The original matrix is:

Row 1: 0, a, 0

Row 2: a, 0, a

Row 3: 0, a, 0

Where a = 1/sqrt(2).

So removing row 1 and column 2, the minor matrix is:

Row 2: [a, a ]

Row 3: [0, 0 ]

Wait, no. Removing row 1 and column 2, the remaining elements are:

Row 2: columns 1 and 3, so [a, a ]

Row 3: columns 1 and 3, so [0, 0 ]

So the minor matrix is:

a  a

0  0

The determinant of this is (a * 0) - (a * 0 ) = 0.

So the determinant of P would be:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)^(1+2) * determinant of minor.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)^3 * 0 = 0.

So the determinant of P is zero.

So the eigenvalues have a product of zero, meaning at least one eigenvalue is zero.

But the trace is zero, so sum of eigenvalues is zero.

So, possible eigenvalues are 0, and others that sum to zero.

Wait, but P is a 3x3 matrix, so it has three eigenvalues. Their product is zero (det P is zero), so at least one eigenvalue is zero.

Wait, but perhaps more. Let me think: Maybe the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0? Because then their sum is zero, but wait, 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0.

But let me confirm that. Let's hypothesize that the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0. Let's check if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues directly.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator. Because P is given as a matrix with elements that look kind of like a projection.

Wait, let me try to compute P squared. If P is a projection operator, then P² = P.

Let me compute P².

P is:

Row 1: 0, a, 0

Row 2: a, 0, a

Row 3: 0, a, 0

Where a = 1/sqrt(2).

So P squared is P multiplied by P.

Let me compute each element:

Element (1,1): Row 1 of P multiplied by column 1 of P. 

Row 1: 0, a, 0.

Column 1 of P: 0, a, 0.

Dot product: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a².

Similarly, (1,2): row 1 . column 2.

Row 1: [0, a, 0]

Column 2: [a, 0, a]

Dot product: 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.

(1,3): row1 . column3:

Row1: [0,a,0]

Column3: [0, a,0]

Dot product: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a².

Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait: the columns of P are:

Column 1: 0, a, 0.

Column 2: a, 0, a.

Column 3: 0, a, 0.

So when computing P squared:

Each element (i,j) is row i of P multiplied by column j of P.

So:

(1,1): 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

(1,2): 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.

(1,3): 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2.

Similarly, (2,1): row 2 of P is [a, 0, a], column 1 is [0, a, 0]

Dot product: a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

(2,2): row 2 . column 2.

Row2: a, 0, a.

Column2: a, 0, a.

So a*a + 0*0 + a*a = a² + a² = 2a² = 2*(1/2) = 1.

(2,3): row2 . column3.

Row2: a, 0, a.

Column3: 0, a, 0.

Dot product: a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

(3,1): row3 . column1.

Row3: 0, a, 0.

Column1: 0, a, 0.

Dot product: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2.

(3,2): row3 . column2.

Row3: 0, a, 0.

Column2: a, 0, a.

Dot product: 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.

(3,3): row3 . column3.

Row3: 0, a, 0.

Column3: 0, a, 0.

Dot product: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2.

So putting it all together, P squared is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, but P squared is not equal to P. Because P's element (1,3) is 0, but in P squared (1,3) is 1/2. So P squared is not equal to P. So P is not a projection operator. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed by finding the eigenvalues. Let's go back.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Earlier, I tried expanding it but got stuck. Let me try again. Alternatively, perhaps I can find eigenvectors by inspection.

Wait, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me see if there's any symmetry or pattern that can help.

Looking at P's structure:

Row 1: 0, a, 0.

Row 2: a, 0, a.

Row 3: 0, a, 0.

So the matrix is symmetric, so we can expect orthogonal eigenvectors.

Let me think about possible eigenvectors.

For example, let me consider a vector like (1, 0, 1). Let's see what P does to this vector.

P * [1; 0; 1] = 

Row 1: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.

Row 2: a*1 + 0*0 + a*1 = a + a = 2a.

Row 3: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.

So P * v = [0; 2a; 0]

Hmm, which is 2a times [0; 1; 0]. So if 2a is an eigenvalue, then [1;0;1] is the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, 2a = 2*(1/√2 )= √2.

So λ = sqrt(2) is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1,0,1]^T. Wait, but wait, when I did the multiplication, I got P*v = [0, 2a, 0]^T, which is 2a times [0,1,0]^T, which is not the same as v. So perhaps this is not an eigenvector. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me recompute P multiplied by v, where v is [1,0,1]^T.

P has rows:

Row1: 0, a, 0.

Row2: a, 0, a.

Row3: 0, a, 0.

So:

Row1 * v: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.

Row2 * v: a*1 + 0*0 + a*1 = a + a = 2a.

Row3 * v: 0*1 + a*0 +0*1 =0.

So P*v = [0; 2a; 0] = 2a [0; 1; 0].

Which is not a multiple of v. So [1; 0; 1] is not an eigenvector, unless 2a = λ, and the resulting vector is [0;1;0], which is orthogonal but not the same as v.

Hmm. Let's try another approach. Let me look for possible eigenvectors.

Suppose I look for an eigenvector where all components are the same, say [1;1;1]. Let's see what P does to this vector.

P * [1;1;1] =

Row1: 0*1 + a*1 + 0*1 = a.

Row2: a*1 + 0*1 + a*1 = 2a.

Row3: 0*1 + a*1 + 0*1 = a.

So P*v = [a; 2a; a] = a [1;2;1].

So this is a multiple of the original vector v only if [1;2;1] is a scalar multiple of [1;1;1], which it isn't. So this isn't an eigenvector.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Let me try to find eigenvectors by assuming certain forms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by using the fact that the trace is zero and the determinant is zero.

Wait, the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant is zero, so the product of eigenvalues is zero. Therefore, one eigenvalue is zero.

Suppose the eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, 0.

Then λ1 + λ2 = 0.

So λ2 = -λ1.

The possible eigenvalues could be, for example, 1, -1, 0.

Alternatively, perhaps sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, let's think about the matrix.

Another approach: perhaps the matrix P has rank 2, because the determinant is zero, so the rank is less than 3. So it has 2 non-zero eigenvalues.

Wait, but the trace is zero, so the sum of non-zero eigenvalues must be zero. So for example, 1 and -1, making the sum zero.

So perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.

But let's test this.

Assume the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.

If that's the case, then when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0. 

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the probability of getting 0. 

So the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

So perhaps I should find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.

Wait, to find the eigenvector for λ=0, we solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + a*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → a v2 =0 → v2=0.

a*v1 + 0*v2 + a*v3 = 0 → a(v1 + v3 )=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

0*v1 + a*v2 +0*v3 = 0 → a v2=0 → v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is all vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

So, for example, [1,0,-1]^T is an eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if this vector is indeed an eigenvector.

Let me compute P * [1, 0, -1]^T.

Row1: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Row2: a*1 + 0*0 + a*(-1) = a (1-1) = 0.

Row3: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So P * [1,0,-1]^T = [0,0,0]^T, which is 0 times the vector. So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So a basis vector is [1,0,-1]^T.

Now, the state vector is (after normalization) [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

I need to find the component of this state in the direction of the eigenvector for λ=0.

The eigenvector for λ=0 is [1,0,-1]^T. Let's normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

The amplitude is the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector.

So amplitude a = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ] · [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

Calculating:

a = (-1/sqrt(6))*(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3)

The square of the absolute value is |a|^2 = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for a given quantum state. The state vector is initially provided as \((-1, 2, 1)\), but it is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector becomes:

\[
\left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right)^T.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring 0, we need to determine the eigenvalues of \( P \). The trace of \( P \) is 0, and the determinant of \( P \) is also 0. This implies that one of the eigenvalues is 0, and the other two eigenvalues are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (to satisfy the trace condition). By inspection, the eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( 1, -1, 0 \).

The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \( 0 \) is found by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). This gives the eigenvector:

\[
\mathbf{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the projection of the normalized state vector onto this eigenvector. The projection amplitude is calculated as:

\[
a = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6} \sqrt{2}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6} \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of \( a \):

\[
|a|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
