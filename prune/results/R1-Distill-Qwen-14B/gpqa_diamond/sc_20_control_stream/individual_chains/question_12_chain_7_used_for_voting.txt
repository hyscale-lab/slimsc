Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the pi meson is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the muon and the neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles, especially in these kinds of problems. So, for the neutrino, I can probably approximate its relativistic energy as just its kinetic energy plus a negligible rest mass energy.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pi meson, right? Because it's at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. So, the energy after decay must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Let me write down the equations. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So,

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

But the energy of each particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So,

m_pi * c^2 = (m_mu * c^2 + K_mu) + (E_nu)

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is so small that we can consider it as zero. So,

E_nu = K_nu + m_nu * c^2 ≈ K_nu.

But wait, if m_nu is zero, then E_nu is just its kinetic energy. But wait, no. Neutrinos have some rest mass, but in this problem, maybe we can ignore it. Or perhaps the problem gives the rest masses, but not for the neutrino. Oh, the problem only gives rest masses for Pi and muon. So I'll proceed assuming the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

So,

E_pi = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (p_nu c)

Wait, wait, that's not right. The energy of the neutrino is just its momentum times c, because if m_nu is zero, then E = pc. So,

E_pi = m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + p_nu c.

But also, since the pi is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So, the momentum of muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So,

p_mu = p_nu

But wait, the magnitude would be the same, but directions opposite. So, their momenta vectors add to zero.

But since neutrino is massless, p_nu = E_nu / c.

For the muon, its energy is:

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So, let me set up the equations.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then, the neutrino's momentum is p as well (same magnitude), but opposite in direction.

So, the muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

The neutrino's energy is p c.

Total energy is then:

E_pi c^2 = [sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) ] + (p c )

Wait, but E_pi is the rest mass energy. So,

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.

Let me write this equation:

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c.

Hmm, I can factor out c^2 from the square root:

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) / c^2? Wait no, wait:

Wait, sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) / c^2? No, wait, more accurately,

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 sqrt( (p^2 + m_mu^2 ) ) ) / c^2? Wait no, maybe let me write it as:

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 * sqrt( p^2/(c^2) + m_mu^2/(c^2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to divide both sides by c^2 to make it dimensionless. Let me let E_pi = m_pi c^2, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2? No, perhaps I should work in units where c=1 to make it easier.

Yes, that's a common practice in particle physics. So, let me set c=1. Then, the equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

So,

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

m_pi - p = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(m_pi - p)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2

Expanding the left side:

m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p = m_mu^2

Rearrange:

-2 m_pi p = m_mu^2 - m_pi^2

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2

So,

p = [ m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Now, plug in the values.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV

m_mu = 105.7 MeV

So,

p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 )

Calculate numerator:

139.6^2 = let's compute that.

139^2 = 19321; 0.6^2 = 0.36, and 2*139*0.6 = 166.8.

So (139.6)^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 167.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, (105.7)^2.

105^2=11025, 0.7^2=0.49, 2*105*0.7=147.

So 105.7^2 = 11025 +147 +0.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Subtract:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

So numerator is 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So,

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Approximately,

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me see: 279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is 60 MeV² more than 8315.67.

So, 30 - (60 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.215 ≈ 29.785.

So p ≈ 29.785 MeV.

Wait, but wait, units?

Hmm, since c=1, the momentum p has units of MeV/c, but since c=1, it's just MeV/c * c = MeV. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, when c=1, energy and mass have units of MeV. Momentum p is in units of MeV/c. Oh wait, but when c=1, p is in MeV/c * c = MeV/c * (c=1) → MeV/c is same as MeV * s/m, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of natural units where c=1.

But perhaps for this calculation, it's better to proceed with the numbers as is.

So p ≈ 29.785 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me try:

279.2 × 30 = 8376 → 30 → 8376.

So 8376 is 60.33 more than 8315.67.

So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) → 30 - 0.216 = 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the units are correct here, but perhaps I can proceed.

Now, the momentum of the muon is 29.784 MeV/c.

But since the muon is moving, its kinetic energy is the total energy minus its rest mass energy.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → with c=1, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

So,

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.784)^2: approx 29.784^2 is about (30 - 0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ 887.086656.

Wait, but maybe exactly, 29.784^2 = ?

Well, 29.784 * 29.784.

Let me compute 30 * 30 =900. Subtract 0.216 * (30 + 29.784) = 0.216*(59.784) ≈ 12.906.

So 900 - 2 * 12.906 + (0.216)^2 → Wait no, that's when you approximate (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 = 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ 887.086656.

So, 29.784^2 ≈ 887.087.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

So, E_mu = sqrt(887.087 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.577) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(12059.577) → let's see, 110^2=12100. So sqrt is about 109.81, since 109.81^2 ≈ 12059.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

But our sum is 12059.58, which is about 3.54 more than 12056.04.

So, 109.8^2=12056.04 → 12056.04 +3.54 = 12059.58.

So, the square root is 109.8 + delta.

Using linear approximation, delta ≈ (3.54)/(2*109.8) ) ≈ 3.54 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So, E_mu ≈ 109.8 + 0.0161 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

So, E_mu is about 109.816 MeV.

Now, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV.

Wait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV.

Now, the neutrino's energy is p c, which is p (since c=1). So, E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait, in the earlier equation, E_pi = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

Which is equal to E_mu + E_nu.

So, 109.816 +29.784 ≈ 139.600, which matches. So that's correct.

So, the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.784 MeV, which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but the problem is to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. So, the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

So, looking at the options, option D has KE values of 4.12 and 29.8 MeV.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of the stationary π⁺ meson into a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses of the π⁺ and μ⁺ are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies (KE) of the decay products.

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the π⁺ is stationary, its total energy is equal to its rest mass energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. This implies that the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Muon**: The total energy of the muon is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4}.
   \]

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**: Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energies
Using the above equations, we solve for the momentum \( p \) of the muon:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p c.
\]
Dividing through by \( c^2 \) and simplifying (in units where \( c = 1 \)):
\[
m_{\pi} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
m_{\pi} - p = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
\[
(m_{\pi} - p)^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu}^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p = m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]
Substituting \( p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
(29.784)^2 = 887.087, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.087 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.577} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, this is also its kinetic energy:
\[
K_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation of energy and momentum must hold.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pi meson, right? Because it's at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. So, the energy after decay must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Let me write down the equations. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So,

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

But the energy of each particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So,

m_pi * c^2 = (m_mu * c^2 + K_mu) + (E_nu)

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is so small that we can consider it as zero. So,

E_nu = K_nu + m_nu * c^2 ≈ K_nu.

But wait, if m_nu is zero, then E_nu is just its kinetic energy. But wait, no. Neutrinos have some rest mass, but in this problem, maybe we can ignore it. Or perhaps the problem gives the rest masses, but not for the neutrino. Oh, the problem only gives rest masses for Pi and muon. So I'll proceed assuming the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

So,

E_pi = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (p_nu c)

Wait, wait, that's not right. The energy of the neutrino is just its momentum times c, because if m_nu is zero, then E = pc. So,

E_pi = m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + p_nu c.

But also, since the pi is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So, the momentum of muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So,

p_mu = p_nu

But wait, the magnitude would be the same, but directions opposite. So, their momenta vectors add to zero.

But since neutrino is massless, p_nu = E_nu / c.

For the muon, its energy is:

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So, let me set up the equations.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then, the neutrino's momentum is p as well (same magnitude), but opposite in direction.

So, the muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

The neutrino's energy is p c.

Total energy is then:

E_pi c^2 = [sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) ] + (p c )

Wait, but E_pi is the rest mass energy. So,

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.

Let me write this equation:

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c.

Hmm, I can factor out c^2 from the square root:

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) / c^2? Wait no, wait:

Wait, sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) / c^2? No, wait, more accurately,

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 sqrt( (p^2 + m_mu^2 ) ) ) / c^2? Wait no, maybe let me write it as:

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c^2 * sqrt( p^2/(c^2) + m_mu^2/(c^2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to divide both sides by c^2 to make it dimensionless. Let me let E_pi = m_pi c^2, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2? No, perhaps I should work in units where c=1 to make it easier.

Yes, that's a common practice in particle physics. So, let me set c=1. Then, the equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

So,

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

m_pi - p = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(m_pi - p)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2

Expanding the left side:

m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p = m_mu^2

Rearrange:

-2 m_pi p = m_mu^2 - m_pi^2

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2

So,

p = [ m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Now, plug in the values.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV

m_mu = 105.7 MeV

So,

p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 )

Calculate numerator:

139.6^2 = let's compute that.

139^2 = 19321; 0.6^2 = 0.36, and 2*139*0.6 = 166.8.

So (139.6)^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 167.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, (105.7)^2.

105^2=11025, 0.7^2=0.49, 2*105*0.7=147.

So 105.7^2 = 11025 +147 +0.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Subtract:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

So numerator is 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So,

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Approximately,

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me see: 279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is 60 MeV² more than 8315.67.

So, 30 - (60 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.215 ≈ 29.785.

So p ≈ 29.785 MeV.

Wait, but wait, units?

Hmm, since c=1, the momentum p has units of MeV/c, but since c=1, it's just MeV/c * c = MeV. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, when c=1, energy and mass have units of MeV. Momentum p is in units of MeV/c. Oh wait, but when c=1, p is in MeV/c * c = MeV/c * (c=1) → MeV/c is same as MeV * s/m, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of natural units where c=1.

But perhaps for this calculation, it's better to proceed with the numbers as is.

So p ≈ 29.785 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me try:

279.2 × 30 = 8376 → 30 → 8376.

So 8376 is 60.33 more than 8315.67.

So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) → 30 - 0.216 = 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the units are correct here, but perhaps I can proceed.

Now, the momentum of the muon is 29.784 MeV/c.

But since the muon is moving, its kinetic energy is the total energy minus its rest mass energy.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → with c=1, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

So,

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.784)^2: approx 29.784^2 is about (30 - 0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ 887.086656.

Wait, but maybe exactly, 29.784^2 = ?

Well, 29.784 * 29.784.

Let me compute 30 * 30 =900. Subtract 0.216 * (30 + 29.784) = 0.216*(59.784) ≈ 12.906.

So 900 - 2 * 12.906 + (0.216)^2 → Wait no, that's when you approximate (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 = 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ 887.086656.

So, 29.784^2 ≈ 887.087.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

So, E_mu = sqrt(887.087 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.577) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(12059.577) → let's see, 110^2=12100. So sqrt is about 109.81, since 109.81^2 ≈ 12059.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

But our sum is 12059.58, which is about 3.54 more than 12056.04.

So, 109.8^2=12056.04 → 12056.04 +3.54 = 12059.58.

So, the square root is 109.8 + delta.

Using linear approximation, delta ≈ (3.54)/(2*109.8) ) ≈ 3.54 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So, E_mu ≈ 109.8 + 0.0161 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

So, E_mu is about 109.816 MeV.

Now, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV.

Wait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV.

Now, the neutrino's energy is p c, which is p (since c=1). So, E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait, in the earlier equation, E_pi = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

Which is equal to E_mu + E_nu.

So, 109.816 +29.784 ≈ 139.600, which matches. So that's correct.

So, the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.784 MeV, which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but the problem is to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. So, the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

So, looking at the options, option D has KE values of 4.12 and 29.8 MeV.

So, the correct answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of the stationary π⁺ meson into a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses of the π⁺ and μ⁺ are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies (KE) of the decay products.

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the π⁺ is stationary, its total energy is equal to its rest mass energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. This implies that the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Muon**: The total energy of the muon is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4}.
   \]

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**: Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energies
Using the above equations, we solve for the momentum \( p \) of the muon:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p c.
\]
Dividing through by \( c^2 \) and simplifying (in units where \( c = 1 \)):
\[
m_{\pi} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
m_{\pi} - p = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
\[
(m_{\pi} - p)^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu}^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p = m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]
Substituting \( p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
(29.784)^2 = 887.087, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.087 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.577} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, this is also its kinetic energy:
\[
K_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
