Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes after each measurement.

First, let me read the question again to make sure I understand everything. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually quantum states are vectors with complex numbers, right? Hmm, but in this case, it's given as real numbers. Maybe it's just a vector in a real vector space or perhaps it's normalized? Wait, I should check the normalization. Let me compute the norm of this vector.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector has a length of sqrt(6), which is more than 1. That's a problem because quantum states should be normalized. Maybe I'm missing something here. Oh, wait! Perhaps the vector is given in a non-normalized form, and I need to normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1.

So the first step is to normalize the state vector. The original vector is [-1, 2, 1], which has a length of sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector |ψ> is:

|ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). So I think that's correct; we have to normalize it.

Now, the operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. Let's write them down.

Operator P's matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. It looks like it's symmetric, so it should be Hermitian, which is good because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

Operator Q's matrix:

First row: [1, 0, 0]

Second row: [0, 0, 0]

Third row: [0, 0, -1]

That's a diagonal matrix, so it's also Hermitian, which makes sense.

The question is about measuring P and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the order of measurement matters because the first measurement affects the state for the second measurement. So the way to approach this is to first find the state after measuring P, then measure Q on that new state, and calculate the probabilities accordingly.

But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we need to find the probability that the first measurement of P gives 0 and then the measurement of Q gives -1.

But how do we find this probability? Let's break it down step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P because when you measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the system's state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but the matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps operator P is a projection operator, but I'm not sure. Let me think: the matrix P has elements 1/sqrt(2) in some places. Let me calculate the trace and determinant to get eigenvalues, but that could be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps operator P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and something else, but I'm not certain. Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. The matrix P is:

[ 0        1/√2     0 ]

[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]

[ 0        1/√2     0 ]

Let me compute the trace (sum of diagonal elements) is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant would be a bit tricky. Let me compute it.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as:

For a matrix:
a b c
d e f
g h i

The determinant is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So for our P matrix:

a=0, b=1/√2, c=0

d=1/√2, e=0, f=1/√2

g=0, h=1/√2, i=0

So determinant = 0*(0*0 - (1/√2)(1/√2)) ) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)*0 - (1/√2)*0 ) + 0*( ... )

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: a*(ei - fh) = 0*(0*0 - (1/√2)(1/√2)) ) = 0*(0 - (1/2)) ) = 0.

Second term: -b*(di - fg) = -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)*0 - (1/√2)*0 ] = -(1/√2)(0) = 0.

Third term: c*(dh - eg) = 0*( (1/√2)(1/√2) - 0*0 ) = 0*( (1/2) - 0 ) = 0.

So the determinant is 0. That implies that 0 is one of the eigenvalues.

But wait, since the trace is 0, the sum of eigenvalues is 0. And the determinant is 0, so the product of eigenvalues is 0. So one eigenvalue is 0. Let's see if it's a repeated root.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is symmetric and can be diagonalized, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach would be better.

Alternatively, since the problem involves an observable P, perhaps the possible outcomes (eigenvalues) are 0, 1, and perhaps 1 again or some other number. Let me think: The matrix P, when squared, perhaps? Or perhaps it's a projection operator.

Wait, let me compute P squared. Let me calculate P^2.

P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So P squared is P multiplied by P.

Let me compute each element of P^2.

Element (1,1): Row 1 of P multiplied by column 1 of P.

= 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2).

Element (1,2): Row 1 * column 2.

= 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (1,3): Row 1 * column 3.

= 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Similarly, element (2,1): Row 2 * column 1.

= (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Element (2,2): Row 2 * column 2.

= (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1.

Element (2,3): Row 2 * column 3.

= (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Element (3,1): Row 3 * column 1.

= 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Element (3,2): Row 3 * column 2.

=0* (1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (3,3): Row3 * column3.

=0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0*0=1/2.

So P squared is:

[ 1/2  0    1/2 ]

[ 0    1    0 ]

[ 1/2  0    1/2 ]

Wait, that's interesting. Now, let me compare P^2 with P. Is P^2 equal to P? Let me see.

Original P:

[ 0  1/√2  0 ]

[1/√2 0 1/√2 ]

[ 0 1/√2 0 ]

Which is different from P^2. So P squared is not equal to P, so P is not a projection operator. Hmm.

But perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by considering the structure of P^2. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues of P are the square roots of the eigenvalues of P^2, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues of P. Since P is a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are real. Let me compute the trace, which is 0, so sum of eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of P is zero, as we found earlier. So one eigenvalue is 0.

What about the other eigenvalues? Let me consider the possible eigenvalues. Suppose the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. Because their sum is 0, and the product would be 0, which matches the determinant. Let me check if this is possible.

Wait, but P is a 3x3 matrix, so it has three eigenvalues. One is 0, and perhaps the other two are 1 and -1. Alternatively, maybe two 1's and -2? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the matrix P. It looks like a structure that might have eigenvectors aligned along certain directions.

Looking at the matrix, perhaps there's an eigenvector in the direction where the first and third components are the same. Let me try a vector like (a, 0, a). Let's see if P acting on this gives a multiple of itself.

P * [a; 0; a] = ?

Using P's matrix:

Row 1: 0*a + (1/√2)*0 + 0*a = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)*a + 0*0 + (1/√2)*a = (2a)/(√2) = a*sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0*a + (1/√2)*0 + 0*a = 0.

So the result is [0; a*sqrt(2); 0], which is not a multiple of [a; 0; a], unless a is zero. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the matrix P could have some symmetry, maybe with eigenvectors that have certain patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by considering the possible outcomes of the measurement. Wait, the question is about measuring P and getting 0. So perhaps 0 is one of the eigenvalues. Let me assume that the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a spin operator in some direction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can compute the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ      1/√2      0    ]

[1/√2   -λ      1/√2  ]

[ 0      1/√2    -λ    ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Computing the determinant:

= -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, let me compute this determinant step by step.

Using the rule for 3x3 determinants:

| -λ       1/√2      0   |
|1/√2     -λ      1/√2  |
| 0       1/√2     -λ    |

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Let me compute each term:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) ) ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/(2)

Third term is zero.

So putting it together:

determinant = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Expand the first term:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ = 0.

So the equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor this: λ (-λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) ) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Ah, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. That's helpful.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

Wait, but the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. So the state after measuring P (assuming outcome 0) will be the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Then, on that state, we measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

So the overall probability is the product of two probabilities: the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, multiplied by the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q on the resulting state.

But first, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue of P.

Let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ = 0:

We have (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So,

[ 0      1/√2     0 ]   [a]   [0]
[1/√2    0      1/√2 ] * [b] = [0]
[ 0      1/√2    0 ]   [c]   [0]

This gives the system of equations:

1. (1/√2) b = 0 → b = 0.

2. (1/√2) a + (1/√2) c = 0 → a + c =0 → a = -c.

3. (1/√2) b =0 → same as first equation, which is redundant.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form [a, 0, a]^T, where a is any scalar. Let's choose a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, 1]^T, but we can normalize it later if needed.

Wait, let me double-check. If a = -c, then for a=1, c=-1. So the vector is [1, 0, -1]^T. Wait, no: because a = -c, so if a=1, then c = -1. So the vector is [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but from equation 2: (1/√2) a + (1/√2) c =0 → a + c = 0 → c = -a.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is [a, 0, -a]^T. So the general form is any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, normalize this eigenvector. The length squared is 1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Next, for λ=1:

We solve (P - I) v =0.

Matrix becomes:

[-1    1/√2     0 ]

[1/√2  -1     1/√2 ]

[ 0    1/√2    -1 ]

So the equations are:

- a + (1/√2) b = 0 → (1/√2) b = a → b= a√2.

(1/√2) a - b + (1/√2) c =0.

(1/√2) b - c = 0 → (1/√2) b = c → c= (1/√2) b = (1/√2)(a√2) )= a.

So substituting b= a√2 and c= a into the second equation:

(1/√2) a - (a√2) + (1/√2) a =0.

Let me compute each term:

(1/√2) a + (1/√2) a = (2/√2) a = sqrt(2) a.

Minus (a√2) → sqrt(2) a - sqrt(2) a = 0. So the equation holds for any a.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [a, a√2, a]^T. We can factor out 'a' and choose a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [1, √2, 1]^T. Now, let's normalize this.

The length squared is 1^2 + (√2)^2 +1^2 = 1 + 2 +1=4. So the normalized vector is (1/2)[1; √2; 1].

So |v1> is (1/2)[1; √2; 1].

Similarly, for λ=-1:

We solve (P + I) v =0.

Matrix becomes:

[1    1/√2    0 ]

[1/√2  1    1/√2 ]

[0    1/√2    1 ]

The equations are:

a + (1/√2) b = 0 → a = - (1/√2) b.

(1/√2) a + b + (1/√2) c =0.

(1/√2) b + c =0 → c = - (1/√2) b.

Substituting a and c into the second equation:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 b) + b + (1/√2)(-1/√2 b) ) = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)(-1/√2) b = (-1/2) b.

(1/√2)(-1/√2) b = (-1/2) b.

So the equation becomes:

(-1/2 b) + b + (-1/2 b) )=0 → (-1/2 -1/2 +1 ) b = 0 → (-1 +1) b =0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [a, b, c], where a= - (1/√2) b, c= - (1/√2) b.

Let me choose b=√2 to make a and c integers. Then a= -1, b=√2, c= -1.

So the eigenvector is [-1; √2; -1]. Let's normalize it.

The length squared is (-1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 +2 +1=4. So the normalized vector is (1/2)[ -1; √2; -1 ].

So |v-1> is (1/2)[ -1; √2; -1 ].

Now, we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for P.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

We need to express this state as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P.

Because when we measure P, the system collapses into one of the eigenvectors, and the coefficients determine the probabilities.

So let's write |ψ> as a sum of the eigenvectors |v0>, |v1>, |v-1>, each multiplied by their respective coefficients.

So |ψ> = c0 |v0> + c1 |v1> + c_{-1} |v_{-1}>

We can compute each ci as the inner product of |ψ> and |vi>.

So let's compute each ci.

First, |v0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1]

Compute c0 = <v0 | ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ]

= (1/sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/(2*sqrt(3))) ( -2 )= -1/sqrt(3).

Similarly, |v1> = (1/2)[1; √2; 1 ]

Compute c1 = <v1 | ψ> = (1/2)(1, √2, 1) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(6))) [ (1)(-1) + (√2)(2) + (1)(1) ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(6))) [ -1 + 2√2 + 1 ] = (1/(2*sqrt(6))) ( 2√2 ) = (2√2)/(2 sqrt(6)) ) = √2 / sqrt(6) = sqrt( (2)/(6) ) ) = sqrt(1/3 ) = 1/sqrt(3).

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

c1:

(1, √2, 1) • [ -1, 2, 1 ] = (-1) + 2√2 + 1 = 2√2.

So c1 = [2√2 ] / (2*sqrt(6)) ) → [ √2 ] / sqrt(6) → √2/(√6) = sqrt(2/6) = sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3).

So c1 = 1/sqrt(3).

Similarly, |v-1> = (1/2)[ -1; √2; -1 ]

Compute c_{-1} = <v_{-1} | ψ> = (1/2)(-1, √2, -1) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(6))) [ (-1)(-1) + (√2)(2) + (-1)(1) ]

= (1/(2 sqrt(6))) [ 1 + 2√2 -1 ] → [ 2√2 ] / (2 sqrt(6)) ) = same as c1 → √2 / sqrt(6) = 1/sqrt(3).

So c_{-1} = 1/sqrt(3).

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

c_{-1}:

(-1)(-1) = 1.

(√2)(2) = 2√2.

(-1)(1) = -1.

Sum: 1 + 2√2 -1 = 2√2.

So c_{-1} = 2√2 / (2 * sqrt(6)) ) = √2 / sqrt(6) → as before.

Which simplifies to 1/sqrt(3).

Wait, but wait:  √2/sqrt(6) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(2/6) = sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3).

So c_{-1} = 1/sqrt(3).

Now, the coefficients are:

c0 = -1/sqrt(3),

c1 = 1/sqrt(3),

c_{-1} = 1/sqrt(3).

Wait a minute, but the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should be 1, because the initial state is normalized.

Let me check:

|c0|^2 + |c1|^2 + |c_{-1}|^2 = (1/3) + (1/3) + (1/3) )= 1. So that's correct.

Now, the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue are the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So P(0) = |c0|^2 = (1/3),

P(1) = |c1|^2 = 1/3,

P(-1) = |c_{-1}|^2 = 1/3.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the sum is 1, so each has 1/3.

Wait, but the initial state is [-1, 2, 1]^T, and the coefficients are as above. So measuring P gives 0 with probability 1/3, 1 with 1/3, and -1 with 1/3.

But the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

So first, the probability of getting 0 for P is 1/3.

Now, when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to |v0>, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Now, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting -1.

So let's find the eigenvalues of Q. The operator Q is:

[1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 -1]

So it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So, the eigenstates are |q+> = [1;0;0], |q0> = [0;1;0], and |q-> = [0;0;1], with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 respectively.

Now, when the state is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1], which can be written as (1/sqrt(2)) |q+> + (1/sqrt(2)) |q->.

Because |v0> = [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2) = [1,0,0]^T/sqrt(2) + [0,0,-1]^T/sqrt(2) = |q+>/sqrt(2) + |q->/sqrt(2).

So the state after measuring P and getting 0 is |v0> = (|q+> + |q-> ) / sqrt(2).

Now, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q: 1, 0, -1.

The probability of getting -1 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |v0> in the |q-> direction.

Looking at |v0>, the component along |q-> is (1/sqrt(2)).

So the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait: |v0> = (|q+> + |q-> ) / sqrt(2).

So the coefficient for |q-> is 1/sqrt(2).

So the probability of measuring -1 for Q is |1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.

So the overall probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because |v0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2), which is (|1> + |3>)/sqrt(2) in the given basis. Since Q's eigenstates are |1>, |2>, |3>, which correspond to eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

So when you express |v0> in the Q basis, it's (|1> + |3>)/sqrt(2). So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the coefficient for |3>, which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the total probability is 1/3 (for P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (for Q=-1), giving 1/6.

So the answer should be option D) 1/6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a quantum system with an initial state given as the normalized vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The observables \(P\) and \(Q\) are represented by the Hermitian operators:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}, \quad 
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \(P\)
The eigenvalues of \(P\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). The eigenvalues are found to be \(0, 1, -1\). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \(\lambda = 0\): \(|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(\lambda = 1\): \(|v_1\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(\lambda = -1\): \(|v_{-1}\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

### Step 2: Expressing the Initial State in Terms of \(P\)'s Eigenvectors
The initial state \(|\psi\rangle\) is expressed as a linear combination of \(P\)'s eigenvectors:

\[
|\psi\rangle = c_0 |v_0\rangle + c_1 |v_1\rangle + c_{-1} |v_{-1}\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients are computed as:

\[
c_0 = \langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}, \quad 
c_1 = \langle v_1 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \quad 
c_{-1} = \langle v_{-1} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \(P\) as \(0, 1, -1\) are the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients:

\[
P(P=0) = |c_0|^2 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad 
P(P=1) = |c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad 
P(P=-1) = |c_{-1}|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.

### Step 3: Measuring \(Q\) After \(P\)
If \(P\) is measured to be \(0\), the system collapses to the eigenvector \(|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\). This state can be expressed in terms of \(Q\)'s eigenstates \(|q_+\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), \(|q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(|q_-\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\) as:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |q_+\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |q_-\rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) is the square of the amplitude of the \(|q_-\rangle\) component in \(|v_0\rangle\):

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Total Probability
The total probability of measuring \(P=0\) and \(Q=-1\) is:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]
