Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electromagnetism and radiation concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. It says this charge distribution radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. The maximum power is given as A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees and the possible form of f regarding λ.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the charge distribution and its symmetry. Since this is a spheroid with symmetry along z, I guess it's either prolate or oblate, but maybe that's not too important here.

Wait, the radiation pattern—like, how the intensity varies with angle. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a certain way. Oh right! A dipole's radiation is maximum at the equator (θ = 90 degrees) and falls off towards the poles (θ=0 and 180). But I'm not sure if this is a dipole scenario, but given it's oscillating spheroid, maybe it's a quadrupole or something else. Hmm, but perhaps the maximum power is at θ=90, but the question says the maximum power is A, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So when they ask about the fraction at θ=30 degrees, I need to find f(θ)/A. So f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle at angle θ. So if f has a certain dependence on θ, we can find the fraction.

I think for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a certain θ dependence. Let me try to recall. The dipole radiation has an intensity that's proportional to 1/(sinθ) squared or something like that. Or wait, maybe the radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). So for a dipole, the intensity I is proportional to sin²θ / (something with λ or r squared). Wait, but in the radiation zone, the fields are considered as radiated fields, and the power per unit solid angle should have a certain angular dependence.

Wait, the formula for the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is something like (p^2 ω^4 sin²θ)/(something with c^5). But more importantly, the angular dependence is sin²θ. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so sin²θ is 1. At θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25 times the maximum, right?

Wait, but the maximum is A. So at θ=30, the power would be A * (sinθ)^2, which is 0.25 A. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction of A is 1/4.

But wait, what's the function f? The question says f is a function of λ and θ. So, in dipole radiation, the radiated power per unit solid angle (which is the intensity) depends on λ. The dependence is usually something like λ^−4, I think. Because power is related to the square of the electric field, which for dipole radiation goes as 1/r, so E ~ 1/r. Power per unit solid angle is E squared times r squared (since power is E² * area, and area is 4πr², but I'm getting a bit confused here).

Wait, let's think. The intensity (power per unit area) for dipole radiation is given by I = (μ0 p0² ω^4 sin²θ)/(12π c^3). And p is the dipole moment, which varies sinusoidally with time, so p0 is the amplitude. Also, ω is related to the frequency, which is related to λ via c = f λ, so ω = 2π f = 2π c / λ. So ω^4 is (2π c / λ)^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 / λ^4.

Substituting back, I = (μ0 p0² (2π c / λ)^4 sin²θ)/(12 π c^3) ). Let's compute the constants:

μ0 is a constant, but when considering the dependence on λ, let's see. The expression would have λ^−4 in the numerator, and denominator has λ^0 (since we're just looking at the dependence on λ). So the intensity I is proportional to λ^−4.

So function f would be proportional to λ^−4. So looking at the options, which options have f as λ^−4?

Looking at the options:

A) 1/2, λ^(-4): So fraction is 1/2, but we calculated 1/4. So A is out.

B) 1/4, λ^(-3): The λ part is wrong.

C) 1/4, λ^(-4): Both the fraction and λ part match.

D) 3/4, λ^(-6): λ part is wrong.

So the correct option would be C: 1/4 and λ^−4.

Wait, but let me double-check the fraction part. The maximum is when sinθ is 1, so at θ=90°, that's the maximum A. At θ=30, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. So yes, the fraction is 1/4.

So the correct option is C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, spheroid in shape, with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the functional dependence of the power on \(\lambda\).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field has an angular dependence proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\). This means the power radiated per unit solid angle is maximum at \(\theta = 90^\circ\) and decreases as \(\theta\) approaches \(0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin\theta = 0.5\), so \(\sin^2\theta = 0.25\). Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(0.25\), or \(1/4\).

The power per unit solid angle (intensity) for dipole radiation also depends on \(\lambda\). Substituting the relationship between angular frequency \(\omega\) and \(\lambda\) (\(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\)), the intensity is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\). Thus, the function \(f\) has the form \(f(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{-4}\).

Among the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the fraction is \(1/2\), which does not match the calculated \(1/4\).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the fraction is \(1/4\), but the \(\lambda\) dependence is \(\lambda^{-3}\), which is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Correct, as both the fraction \(1/4\) and the \(\lambda\) dependence \(\lambda^{-4}\) are consistent with the analysis.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the fraction is \(3/4\), which is wrong, and the \(\lambda\) dependence is \(\lambda^{-6}\), which is also incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
