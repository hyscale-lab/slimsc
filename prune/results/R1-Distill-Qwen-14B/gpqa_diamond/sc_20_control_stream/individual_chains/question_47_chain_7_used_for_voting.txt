Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR data. Let's see.

First, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 (no halogens), N is 1. So: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees: that can be like a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an amide or something else (another 1). So probably a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad, probably N-H stretches. Wait, but wait, the question says medium to strong intensity. Broad bands in IR are usually N-H, like in amines or amides. So maybe an amine or amide group is present. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl stretch. Could be ester, amide, ketone, etc. But since the molecular formula has O2, maybe an ester or amide.

Looking at the NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something else. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl ether.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad could be an NH group, but wait, in 1H NMR, amines or amides can show broad signals. But wait, it's 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group? Or NH2?

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet implies two neighboring groups. So if you have a CH2 connected to another CH2, which is connected to something else. Like OCH2CH2O, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -OCH2CH2- group. Or perhaps a -CH2-O-CH2- arrangement.

7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H; 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. That sounds like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because para substituents would give two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the aromatic region suggests a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Putting it all together: the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is likely an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl in IR. Let's think about options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: That would have a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group. Wait, but benzamide is a CONH2, which as an amide would have N-H stretches. But the substituents would be at the 3 and para positions? Wait, 3-ethoxy would be meta, but the benzamide is at position 1. Hmm, but the NMR shows two substituents on the benzene, so maybe 3-ethoxy and another group at position 4? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (so CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. But that would mean the substituents are at 3 and 1? Or 3 and 4? Wait, benzamide is at position 1. So substituents would be 1 and 3. But the NMR shows a para substitution. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is HCONH- attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl ring. So the substituents would be at 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide at position 1 (but formamide is a substituent on the benzene). Wait, but in that case, the benzene would have an ethoxy group and a formamide group in para positions. So how would the NMR look? The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The ethoxy group would be at 4.5 ppm, as a quartet? Wait, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches the first NMR peak. The OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet (2H), and 4.5 is a quartet (2H). Hmm, maybe that's for the formamide's part? Not sure.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is CH2CH2COOH attached to a 4-aminophenyl ring. Wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. But if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it would have NH2 and COOEt (if it's ethyl ester) or similar. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: Benzene (6 C), then NH2 (1 N), COO- (2 O), and the ethyl ester would add 2 C and 5 H (for CH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's count for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Add ethoxy (OCH2CH3): adds 2 C and 5 H, so total would be C9H12NO2? Because benzamide is C7H5NO2, plus ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H6O2NO2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Molecular formula is C7H7NO2. Then ethoxy would be OCH2CH3, so adding that as a substituent would make C7 + 2 = C9, and H7 + 5 (ethoxy has 5 H: 2 in OCH2CH3?) Wait, OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 and 3 CH3? No, ethoxy has 5 H: OCH2CH3 has 2 H on OCH2 and 3 on CH3, total 5. So benzamide has 7 H: the benzene (5 H if substituents are at 1 and 3?), wait no, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So the benzene has five H (since one position is CONH2). Then adding ethoxy at position 3: the benzene would have 4 H? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecular formulas of the options.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2 (with NH2 at position 4). The formula: benzoate is C7H5O2, but as an ethyl ester, the formula becomes C9H10NO2. Wait, that doesn't match our compound's formula C9H11NO2. Hmmm, wait: benzoate is C7H5O2- (from C6H5COO-), add ethyl ester (C2H5O), so the ester is C9H10O2. But with the amine, maybe?

Wait, 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO3. Its ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2. Because the acid is C7H7NO3, esterifying with ethanol (C2H5OH) would replace the -OH with OEt, so formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + (5 from OEt) = H12? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count: Benzoate is C6H5COOEt. C6 + COOEt (which is C3H5O2? Wait, COOEt is COO-C2H5. So COOEt is C3H5O2. So benzene is C6, COOEt is C3, so total C9. H: benzene (5 H if one substituent), COOEt (5 H: the ethyl group has 5 H?), but wait, the ethyl ester is OCH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H. So the benzoate ester would have 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + the H from COO? No, wait, the benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5 has 5 H (assuming one substituent), COOEt is O-CO-OEt. So the ester is C6H5COOEt: total formula is C9H10O2. Then, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because adding an NH2 (which contributes 2 H) to the above. Wait, no: benzoate is C7H6O2 (since C6H5COO- is C7H5O2-). If you have an NH2 group, then it's C7H7NO2. As the ethyl ester, it becomes C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So option D would have formula C9H11NO2. So that's a possible candidate.

Now, looking at the NMR data again.

1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): likely the CH3 in an ethyl group. So OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): maybe the NH2 group? But NH2 protons are usually broad and might appear around 1-5 ppm. But in the case of an amine, they can be a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests no neighboring H. If it's an NH2 group, that would make sense because the two H are equivalent and not split. But in the case of D, it's 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. The NH2 would be on the benzene. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but how many H? Two, so a singlet. So 4.0 ppm might be the NH2, but wait, amines are usually more downfield, like around 1-5 ppm, but depending on the environment.

Wait, another possibility is that the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Let me think: the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be the OCH2 of an ethyl ester. Because in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be next to the CH3. The OCH2 would show as a quartet because it's next to the CH2CH3, which has two H. Wait, no: the OCH2 in an ethyl ester would be split by the adjacent CH2. So for OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH2's two H), and the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled with the OCH2's two H). So the triplet at 1.2 ppm is the CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2. So that would align with the NMR data.

Then what about the 4.0 ppm peak? It's a broad singlet of 2H. Could that be the NH2 group? Because in the structure D, the benzene has an NH2 group. But in the NMR, the NH2 protons are usually broad, but their chemical shift depends on whether they're aromatic or not. Wait, in 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is a primary amine attached to the benzene. The NH2 protons are likely to be around 1-5 ppm, but they can be a bit downfield, especially if de-shielded.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, sometimes the NH2 protons can be a singlet if they're both equivalent and not split by anything. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange with D2O, but I don't think that would be the case here.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm peak could be a CH2 group, but why would it be a broad singlet? Maybe it's an amide NH? But in the IR, we have N-H stretches, which would suggest NH groups, but in the case of amides, the NH is usually more deshielded. Wait, but the options include benzamide (option A) and formamide (option B), which are amides.

Wait, looking back at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad, which would suggest N-H stretches. Amide N-H would typically show two bands, as in the primary amide, which would have two peaks around 3300-3400 cm-1. So that fits with an amide.

So if the compound has an amide group, then that would explain the IR peaks.

Now, looking at the NMR again. The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H) could be the NH2 group, but that would be in the case of an amine. Wait, but if it's an amide, maybe the NH is a single H? No, in a primary amide, you have two H on N. So in that case, the NH2 would be a broad singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, but with some splitting that's causing it to be a broad peak. But that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the options.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the benzene has an ethoxy group and a formamide group at para positions.

In the NMR, the ethoxy group's CH3 would be triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches. The OCH2 would be quartet around 4.5 ppm. Then, the formamide group would have NH protons. But formamide is a primary amide, so the NH2 would be a broad peak. So in the 1H NMR, the NH2 would be a broad singlet around, say, 4.0 ppm? But I'm not sure about the chemical shift.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with OCOOEt and NH2 in para positions. The NH2 would be a broad peak. But amines are usually less deshielded than amides. So their NH protons are around 1-5 ppm. Could the 4.0 ppm be the NH2?

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is something else. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen or another group.

Wait, looking at the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). If that's the OCH2 of the ethyl ester, then the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3, which fits. So that would support option D.

But then what about the 4.0 ppm? Could that be the NH2? If it's an amine, then that makes sense. The NH2 would be a broad singlet. But why is it at 4.0 ppm? Because primary amines (like NH2) are typically around 1-5 ppm, but they can vary. So 4.0 is plausible.

So the aromatic region: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So if the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (like amide or ester) and an electron-donating group (like ethoxy or amine), the protons ortho to the EWG would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D), the substituents are OCOOEt (EWG) and NH2 (EDG). So the protons ortho to OCOOEt would be more deshielded, appearing downfield (higher ppm), while those ortho to NH2 would be less deshielded, appearing upfield. Wait, but the benzoate is an EWG, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. The amine is an EDG, so the ortho protons would be more shielded and appear upfield. So in the NMR, the two doublets would correspond to the two sets of ortho protons. One would be around 8.0 ppm (downfield), and the other around 7.0 ppm. Which matches the data.

So putting it all together, the NMR data for option D would have:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl OCH2.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

- Aromatic region: d at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.

Wait, but wait: the OCH2 in the ethyl ester would be at around 4.2-4.3 ppm, if I recall, but in the NMR it's at 4.5. Hmm. Could that be a problem? Or perhaps I'm remembering the typical shift wrong.

Alternatively, the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be something else. Let me think about another option.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

In this case, the ethoxy group is at 4.0 ppm, but perhaps the OCH2 is at a different shift. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0 ppm? Let's see:

NMR:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethoxy CH3.

- 4.5 ppm: maybe the formamide's NH2? No, because formamide's NH is a single H if it's a secondary amide. Wait, no: formamide is HCONH2, a primary amide. So the NH2 would be a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm could be that NH2 group. But wait, in the NMR data, that's a broad singlet (2H), which would fit the NH2.

The ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet. Let's see: in ethoxy (OCH2CH3), the OCH2 is next to the CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (since it's adjacent to two H from CH2CH3). The CH3 would be a triplet. So in this case, the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.2 ppm, but the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, maybe that's not a match.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the formamide's part? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the structures.

Option B: HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would have a quartet around 4.0-4.2 ppm. So in the NMR, that would be the quartet at 4.0? But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that's a discrepancy.

Option D: OCH2CH3 is part of the ester. So the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2-4.3. But in the NMR, it's at 4.5. So maybe that's a problem. Or perhaps the shift is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from another group. Let me think about the other options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is CH2CH2COO- attached to 4-aminophenyl. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be O=C(O-)-CH2CH2- attached to benzene with NH2 at para position.

In that case, the ethyl would be from the propionate. Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is a three-carbon chain. So the propionate ester would have a longer chain.

In the NMR, the 1.2 ppm triplet suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. Like in ethyl ester. So propionate would have a triplet at around 1.6 ppm (for the CH2CH2COO group?), but the given data shows a triplet at 1.20. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Moreover, the OCH2 in a propionate ester would be further away from the benzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a propionate, maybe the COOCH2CH2CH3 would have the middle CH2 as a quartet. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: looking at the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So what types of carbonyls are present in the options?

Option A: benzamide. The carbonyl in an amide would be around 1640-1700 cm-1. So 1720 might be a bit high for an amide. But maybe it depends.

Option B: formamide. The carbonyl in a formamide is around 1680-1700, so 1720 might be a bit high.

Option C: propionate ester. The carbonyl in an ester is typically around 1720-1760 cm-1. So D's ester carbonyl would be in that range.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches.

So the IR peak at 1720 would support an ester, which would fit option D.

The amide in option A would have a lower carbonyl stretch, perhaps around 1640, which doesn't match the given 1720. So option A is less likely.

So putting it all together, option D seems to fit the IR data better. The NMR data:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl OCH2.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

The aromatic region: two doublets, which would be from the para substituents. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) would correspond to the protons next to the ester group (EWG), and the upfield shift (7.0 ppm) would be next to the amine (EDG).

So the NMR data seems to fit option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the OCH2 in the ethyl ester being around 4.2-4.3, but the NMR shows 4.5. Could that be a problem? Perhaps it's shifted due to the proximity of the amine group or other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the shifts. Let me think: the OCH2 in an ethyl ester is usually around 4.2-4.3 as a quartet. So in option D, the OCH2 would be around 4.2, but in the data, it's at 4.5. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe the quartet isn't from the ethyl ester. Could it be from another group? Maybe the NH2 is part of the quartet? Or perhaps the structure has a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is from a different CH2 group. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom. Maybe a methylene group in an amide.

Wait, looking back at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide group is HCONH-. The NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0 ppm. The ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.2. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, the quartet is the formamide's NH? No, because formamide's NH would be a broad singlet, not a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from another part. Let me think about the structure again.

Another thought: the quartet at 4.5 could be from a CH2 group between two oxygen atoms, like OCH2O. But that's not present in any of the options. Alternatively, maybe an acetal or something else.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but then the triplet would be downfield.

Hmm, perhaps I should recount the possible structures.

Looking back, option D's NMR would have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 (q, 2H): ethyl OCH2.

- 4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2.

And the aromatic region.

So the only thing that doesn't match perfectly is the OCH2 being at 4.5 instead of 4.2. But maybe the presence of an adjacent substituent (like the amine) could deshield it, shifting it upfield or downfield. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data is approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

In this case, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2 ppm, and the NH2 would be a broad peak. The formamide's HCONH2 would have a carbonyl at around 1680 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Option D's ester carbonyl fits the IR.

So, perhaps the NMR data for option D: OCH2 at 4.5 instead of 4.2. Is that a significant difference? Maybe in the real world, the shifts can vary slightly based on substituents. So perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet isn't the OCH2. Another thought: in option D, the NH2 is a broad singlet. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. That would match the NH2.

So bringing it all together, option D seems to fit the data.

The compound C9H11NO2 is to be identified based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data. Here's the analysis:

### Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation
The molecular formula C9H11NO2 has **5 degrees of unsaturation**, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group.

---

### IR Data Analysis
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These broad bands suggest the presence of N-H bonds, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

---

### 1H NMR Data Analysis
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (CH₃) in an ethyl group (CH₂CH₃).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H could correspond to an NH₂ group or a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H suggests a methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to another CH₂ group, likely part of an ethyl ester (OCH₂CH₃).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### Option Analysis
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The IR data does not strongly support this structure because the carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically lower (around 1640–1700 cm⁻¹), not 1720 cm⁻¹.
- The NMR data does not match because the substituents would not produce the observed aromatic splitting (para substitution is expected, but the substituents would not align with the data).

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH₂) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The ethoxy group would produce a quartet at ~4.2 ppm (OCH₂), but the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is inconsistent.
- The carbonyl stretch for a formamide is typically around 1680–1700 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹, making this option less likely.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: A propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) attached to a 4-aminophenyl group.
- The NMR data does not match because the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH₂) suggest an ethyl group, not a propyl group.
- The aromatic splitting and IR data do not align well with this structure.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzoate ester (OCOOEt) with an NH₂ group at position 4 on the benzene ring.
- **IR Data**: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carbonyl stretch of an ester.
- **NMR Data**:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Matches the CH₃ group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Matches the OCH₂ group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Matches the NH₂ group on the benzene ring.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Matches the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is consistent with this structure.

---

### Conclusion
The IR and NMR data align best with **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The ester carbonyl matches the IR data, and the NMR signals correspond to the ethyl ester, NH₂ group, and para-substituted benzene ring.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR data. Let's see.

First, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 (no halogens), N is 1. So: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees: that can be like a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an amide or something else (another 1). So probably a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad, probably N-H stretches. Wait, but wait, the question says medium to strong intensity. Broad bands in IR are usually N-H, like in amines or amides. So maybe an amine or amide group is present. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl stretch. Could be ester, amide, ketone, etc. But since the molecular formula has O2, maybe an ester or amide.

Looking at the NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something else. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl ether.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad could be an NH group, but wait, in 1H NMR, amines or amides can show broad signals. But wait, it's 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group? Or NH2?

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet implies two neighboring groups. So if you have a CH2 connected to another CH2, which is connected to something else. Like OCH2CH2O, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -OCH2CH2- group. Or perhaps a -CH2-O-CH2- arrangement.

7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H; 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. That sounds like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because para substituents would give two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the aromatic region suggests a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Putting it all together: the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is likely an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl in IR. Let's think about options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: That would have a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group. Wait, but benzamide is a CONH2, which as an amide would have N-H stretches. But the substituents would be at the 3 and para positions? Wait, 3-ethoxy would be meta, but the benzamide is at position 1. Hmm, but the NMR shows two substituents on the benzene, so maybe 3-ethoxy and another group at position 4? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (so CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. But that would mean the substituents are at 3 and 1? Or 3 and 4? Wait, benzamide is at position 1. So substituents would be 1 and 3. But the NMR shows a para substitution. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is HCONH- attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl ring. So the substituents would be at 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide at position 1 (but formamide is a substituent on the benzene). Wait, but in that case, the benzene would have an ethoxy group and a formamide group in para positions. So how would the NMR look? The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The ethoxy group would be at 4.5 ppm, as a quartet? Wait, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches the first NMR peak. The OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet (2H), and 4.5 is a quartet (2H). Hmm, maybe that's for the formamide's part? Not sure.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is CH2CH2COOH attached to a 4-aminophenyl ring. Wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. But if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it would have NH2 and COOEt (if it's ethyl ester) or similar. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: Benzene (6 C), then NH2 (1 N), COO- (2 O), and the ethyl ester would add 2 C and 5 H (for CH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's count for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Add ethoxy (OCH2CH3): adds 2 C and 5 H, so total would be C9H12NO2? Because benzamide is C7H5NO2, plus ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H6O2NO2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Molecular formula is C7H7NO2. Then ethoxy would be OCH2CH3, so adding that as a substituent would make C7 + 2 = C9, and H7 + 5 (ethoxy has 5 H: 2 in OCH2CH3?) Wait, OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 and 3 CH3? No, ethoxy has 5 H: OCH2CH3 has 2 H on OCH2 and 3 on CH3, total 5. So benzamide has 7 H: the benzene (5 H if substituents are at 1 and 3?), wait no, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So the benzene has five H (since one position is CONH2). Then adding ethoxy at position 3: the benzene would have 4 H? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecular formulas of the options.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2 (with NH2 at position 4). The formula: benzoate is C7H5O2, but as an ethyl ester, the formula becomes C9H10NO2. Wait, that doesn't match our compound's formula C9H11NO2. Hmmm, wait: benzoate is C7H5O2- (from C6H5COO-), add ethyl ester (C2H5O), so the ester is C9H10O2. But with the amine, maybe?

Wait, 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO3. Its ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2. Because the acid is C7H7NO3, esterifying with ethanol (C2H5OH) would replace the -OH with OEt, so formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + (5 from OEt) = H12? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count: Benzoate is C6H5COOEt. C6 + COOEt (which is C3H5O2? Wait, COOEt is COO-C2H5. So COOEt is C3H5O2. So benzene is C6, COOEt is C3, so total C9. H: benzene (5 H if one substituent), COOEt (5 H: the ethyl group has 5 H?), but wait, the ethyl ester is OCH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H. So the benzoate ester would have 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + the H from COO? No, wait, the benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5 has 5 H (assuming one substituent), COOEt is O-CO-OEt. So the ester is C6H5COOEt: total formula is C9H10O2. Then, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because adding an NH2 (which contributes 2 H) to the above. Wait, no: benzoate is C7H6O2 (since C6H5COO- is C7H5O2-). If you have an NH2 group, then it's C7H7NO2. As the ethyl ester, it becomes C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So option D would have formula C9H11NO2. So that's a possible candidate.

Now, looking at the NMR data again.

1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): likely the CH3 in an ethyl group. So OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): maybe the NH2 group? But NH2 protons are usually broad and might appear around 1-5 ppm. But in the case of an amine, they can be a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests no neighboring H. If it's an NH2 group, that would make sense because the two H are equivalent and not split. But in the case of D, it's 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. The NH2 would be on the benzene. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but how many H? Two, so a singlet. So 4.0 ppm might be the NH2, but wait, amines are usually more downfield, like around 1-5 ppm, but depending on the environment.

Wait, another possibility is that the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Let me think: the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be the OCH2 of an ethyl ester. Because in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be next to the CH3. The OCH2 would show as a quartet because it's next to the CH2CH3, which has two H. Wait, no: the OCH2 in an ethyl ester would be split by the adjacent CH2. So for OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH2's two H), and the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled with the OCH2's two H). So the triplet at 1.2 ppm is the CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2. So that would align with the NMR data.

Then what about the 4.0 ppm peak? It's a broad singlet of 2H. Could that be the NH2 group? Because in the structure D, the benzene has an NH2 group. But in the NMR, the NH2 protons are usually broad, but their chemical shift depends on whether they're aromatic or not. Wait, in 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is a primary amine attached to the benzene. The NH2 protons are likely to be around 1-5 ppm, but they can be a bit downfield, especially if de-shielded.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, sometimes the NH2 protons can be a singlet if they're both equivalent and not split by anything. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange with D2O, but I don't think that would be the case here.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm peak could be a CH2 group, but why would it be a broad singlet? Maybe it's an amide NH? But in the IR, we have N-H stretches, which would suggest NH groups, but in the case of amides, the NH is usually more deshielded. Wait, but the options include benzamide (option A) and formamide (option B), which are amides.

Wait, looking back at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad, which would suggest N-H stretches. Amide N-H would typically show two bands, as in the primary amide, which would have two peaks around 3300-3400 cm-1. So that fits with an amide.

So if the compound has an amide group, then that would explain the IR peaks.

Now, looking at the NMR again. The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H) could be the NH2 group, but that would be in the case of an amine. Wait, but if it's an amide, maybe the NH is a single H? No, in a primary amide, you have two H on N. So in that case, the NH2 would be a broad singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, but with some splitting that's causing it to be a broad peak. But that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the options.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the benzene has an ethoxy group and a formamide group at para positions.

In the NMR, the ethoxy group's CH3 would be triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches. The OCH2 would be quartet around 4.5 ppm. Then, the formamide group would have NH protons. But formamide is a primary amide, so the NH2 would be a broad peak. So in the 1H NMR, the NH2 would be a broad singlet around, say, 4.0 ppm? But I'm not sure about the chemical shift.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with OCOOEt and NH2 in para positions. The NH2 would be a broad peak. But amines are usually less deshielded than amides. So their NH protons are around 1-5 ppm. Could the 4.0 ppm be the NH2?

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is something else. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen or another group.

Wait, looking at the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). If that's the OCH2 of the ethyl ester, then the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3, which fits. So that would support option D.

But then what about the 4.0 ppm? Could that be the NH2? If it's an amine, then that makes sense. The NH2 would be a broad singlet. But why is it at 4.0 ppm? Because primary amines (like NH2) are typically around 1-5 ppm, but they can vary. So 4.0 is plausible.

So the aromatic region: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So if the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (like amide or ester) and an electron-donating group (like ethoxy or amine), the protons ortho to the EWG would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D), the substituents are OCOOEt (EWG) and NH2 (EDG). So the protons ortho to OCOOEt would be more deshielded, appearing downfield (higher ppm), while those ortho to NH2 would be less deshielded, appearing upfield. Wait, but the benzoate is an EWG, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. The amine is an EDG, so the ortho protons would be more shielded and appear upfield. So in the NMR, the two doublets would correspond to the two sets of ortho protons. One would be around 8.0 ppm (downfield), and the other around 7.0 ppm. Which matches the data.

So putting it all together, the NMR data for option D would have:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl OCH2.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

- Aromatic region: d at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.

Wait, but wait: the OCH2 in the ethyl ester would be at around 4.2-4.3 ppm, if I recall, but in the NMR it's at 4.5. Hmm. Could that be a problem? Or perhaps I'm remembering the typical shift wrong.

Alternatively, the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be something else. Let me think about another option.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

In this case, the ethoxy group is at 4.0 ppm, but perhaps the OCH2 is at a different shift. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0 ppm? Let's see:

NMR:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethoxy CH3.

- 4.5 ppm: maybe the formamide's NH2? No, because formamide's NH is a single H if it's a secondary amide. Wait, no: formamide is HCONH2, a primary amide. So the NH2 would be a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm could be that NH2 group. But wait, in the NMR data, that's a broad singlet (2H), which would fit the NH2.

The ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet. Let's see: in ethoxy (OCH2CH3), the OCH2 is next to the CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (since it's adjacent to two H from CH2CH3). The CH3 would be a triplet. So in this case, the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.2 ppm, but the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, maybe that's not a match.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the formamide's part? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the structures.

Option B: HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would have a quartet around 4.0-4.2 ppm. So in the NMR, that would be the quartet at 4.0? But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that's a discrepancy.

Option D: OCH2CH3 is part of the ester. So the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2-4.3. But in the NMR, it's at 4.5. So maybe that's a problem. Or perhaps the shift is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from another group. Let me think about the other options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is CH2CH2COO- attached to 4-aminophenyl. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be O=C(O-)-CH2CH2- attached to benzene with NH2 at para position.

In that case, the ethyl would be from the propionate. Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is a three-carbon chain. So the propionate ester would have a longer chain.

In the NMR, the 1.2 ppm triplet suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. Like in ethyl ester. So propionate would have a triplet at around 1.6 ppm (for the CH2CH2COO group?), but the given data shows a triplet at 1.20. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Moreover, the OCH2 in a propionate ester would be further away from the benzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a propionate, maybe the COOCH2CH2CH3 would have the middle CH2 as a quartet. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: looking at the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So what types of carbonyls are present in the options?

Option A: benzamide. The carbonyl in an amide would be around 1640-1700 cm-1. So 1720 might be a bit high for an amide. But maybe it depends.

Option B: formamide. The carbonyl in a formamide is around 1680-1700, so 1720 might be a bit high.

Option C: propionate ester. The carbonyl in an ester is typically around 1720-1760 cm-1. So D's ester carbonyl would be in that range.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches.

So the IR peak at 1720 would support an ester, which would fit option D.

The amide in option A would have a lower carbonyl stretch, perhaps around 1640, which doesn't match the given 1720. So option A is less likely.

So putting it all together, option D seems to fit the IR data better. The NMR data:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl OCH2.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

The aromatic region: two doublets, which would be from the para substituents. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) would correspond to the protons next to the ester group (EWG), and the upfield shift (7.0 ppm) would be next to the amine (EDG).

So the NMR data seems to fit option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the OCH2 in the ethyl ester being around 4.2-4.3, but the NMR shows 4.5. Could that be a problem? Perhaps it's shifted due to the proximity of the amine group or other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the shifts. Let me think: the OCH2 in an ethyl ester is usually around 4.2-4.3 as a quartet. So in option D, the OCH2 would be around 4.2, but in the data, it's at 4.5. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe the quartet isn't from the ethyl ester. Could it be from another group? Maybe the NH2 is part of the quartet? Or perhaps the structure has a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is from a different CH2 group. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom. Maybe a methylene group in an amide.

Wait, looking back at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide group is HCONH-. The NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0 ppm. The ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.2. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, the quartet is the formamide's NH? No, because formamide's NH would be a broad singlet, not a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from another part. Let me think about the structure again.

Another thought: the quartet at 4.5 could be from a CH2 group between two oxygen atoms, like OCH2O. But that's not present in any of the options. Alternatively, maybe an acetal or something else.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but then the triplet would be downfield.

Hmm, perhaps I should recount the possible structures.

Looking back, option D's NMR would have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 (q, 2H): ethyl OCH2.

- 4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2.

And the aromatic region.

So the only thing that doesn't match perfectly is the OCH2 being at 4.5 instead of 4.2. But maybe the presence of an adjacent substituent (like the amine) could deshield it, shifting it upfield or downfield. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data is approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph.

In this case, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2 ppm, and the NH2 would be a broad peak. The formamide's HCONH2 would have a carbonyl at around 1680 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Option D's ester carbonyl fits the IR.

So, perhaps the NMR data for option D: OCH2 at 4.5 instead of 4.2. Is that a significant difference? Maybe in the real world, the shifts can vary slightly based on substituents. So perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet isn't the OCH2. Another thought: in option D, the NH2 is a broad singlet. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. That would match the NH2.

So bringing it all together, option D seems to fit the data.


The compound C9H11NO2 is to be identified based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data. Here's the analysis:

### Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation
The molecular formula C9H11NO2 has **5 degrees of unsaturation**, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group.

---

### IR Data Analysis
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These broad bands suggest the presence of N-H bonds, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

---

### 1H NMR Data Analysis
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (CH₃) in an ethyl group (CH₂CH₃).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H could correspond to an NH₂ group or a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H suggests a methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to another CH₂ group, likely part of an ethyl ester (OCH₂CH₃).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### Option Analysis
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The IR data does not strongly support this structure because the carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically lower (around 1640–1700 cm⁻¹), not 1720 cm⁻¹.
- The NMR data does not match because the substituents would not produce the observed aromatic splitting (para substitution is expected, but the substituents would not align with the data).

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH₂) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The ethoxy group would produce a quartet at ~4.2 ppm (OCH₂), but the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is inconsistent.
- The carbonyl stretch for a formamide is typically around 1680–1700 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹, making this option less likely.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: A propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) attached to a 4-aminophenyl group.
- The NMR data does not match because the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH₂) suggest an ethyl group, not a propyl group.
- The aromatic splitting and IR data do not align well with this structure.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzoate ester (OCOOEt) with an NH₂ group at position 4 on the benzene ring.
- **IR Data**: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carbonyl stretch of an ester.
- **NMR Data**:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Matches the CH₃ group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Matches the OCH₂ group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Matches the NH₂ group on the benzene ring.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Matches the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is consistent with this structure.

---

### Conclusion
The IR and NMR data align best with **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The ester carbonyl matches the IR data, and the NMR signals correspond to the ethyl ester, NH₂ group, and para-substituted benzene ring.

**Answer: D**
