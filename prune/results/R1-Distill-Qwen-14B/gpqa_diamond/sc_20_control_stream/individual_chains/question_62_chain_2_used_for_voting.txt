Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me see if I can parse its structure. It sounds like it has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane, and there's also a carbaldehyde group (CHO) on the same carbon as the substituent. Wait, no—actually, the numbering might be different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane has a methyl group attached, which itself is connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. And then, there's a carbaldehyde group somewhere else. 

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. So the main ring is cyclohexane. On one of its carbons (probably position 1), there's a substituent that's a methyl group. This methyl is attached to two other groups: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached at position 1. Additionally, there's a CHO (aldehyde) group on that same carbon. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have both an aldehyde and another substituent on the same carbon unless it's a geminal di-substituent, but that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is on another carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which might imply that the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group at position 1. Wait, that's not possible either because a single carbon can't have two substituents besides the cyclohexane ring unless it's a quaternary carbon. Oh wait, wait—maybe the molecule is structured as a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group that's attached to two other groups: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. And the cyclohexane also has a carbaldehyde group at position 1. Hmm, but that would imply that the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached to it. Then, the same carbon where the methyl is attached also has an aldehyde group. Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group. This CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Additionally, perhaps there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon, making it CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that would require the same carbon to have three substituents and the ring, which is possible. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane (another ring) and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon also has an aldehyde group. But I might be getting mixed up. Let me think about the synthesis steps instead.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. The structure is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent. So it's cyclohexyl-ethynyl, perhaps. 

So the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to think about how to get from ethynylcyclohexane to that.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. So I need to add substituents and functional groups to this structure to reach the target.

Hmm. So the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the steps that are usually taken in such syntheses.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li/liq. NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, etc.

Let me think about possible reaction sequences.

Ethynylcyclohexane is a strained alkyne. Reactions with alkynes often involve adding hydrogen or undergoing hydroboration, or maybe other additions.

But looking at the options, step 1 in all options is NaNH2 and something else. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation. For example, in the formation of alkynes from alkenes via elimination, but more commonly, NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction or in deprotonation of terminal alkynes to form lithium acetylides. Wait, when you have a terminal alkyne, like ethynylcyclohexane, treating with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia would deprotonate it to form a lithium acetylide. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. The terminal hydrogen is acidic because of the sp-hybridized carbon. So NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form a cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Li^+.

Then, the next step is adding an alkylating agent. In option A, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Option B uses ethyl chloride. C uses methyl chloride, D uses methanol.

Wait, after forming the acetylide, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it. So adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide. So the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^-Li^+. Adding CH3Cl would give CH2-CCl-CH3? No, wait, the acetylide is the conjugate base. So when you have cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- ), adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Because the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride, CH3Cl, to add a methyl group. So that would make a longer alkyne: (cyclohexyl)propyne, I guess. Wait, propyne would be HC≡C-CH2-... Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So that's a propyne derivative.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let's think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So NaNH2 deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes longer. So from CH2-C≡CH (ethynyl) to CH2-C≡C-CH3 (prop-1-ynylcyclohexane). So now, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a prop-1-ynyl group.

Wait, but in the options, some sequences have more steps. So after alkylation, what's next? Let's look at the options.

Option A: After step 1, NaNH2 and methyl chloride, step 2 is H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of the alkyne. So H2 with palladium as catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So prop-1-ynylcyclohexane becomes propylcyclohexane. So CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem directly helpful. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in the oxidation of alcohols, or in elimination reactions. And step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols to ketones. 

Wait, let me see:

So starting from ethynylcyclohexane:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexylprop-1-ynyl group (but perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, maybe it's CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane?), no, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^-. Then adding CH3Cl would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the alkyne is now a propyne. Then hydrogenation would convert it to a propane group. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then Ba(OH)2, perhaps an elimination reaction. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base, could cause deprotonation and elimination. But in this molecule, if we have a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, perhaps Ba(OH)2 would cause some elimination, but where? Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation step. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, but after hydrogenation, we have a propane chain. Then, without any functional groups, Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much. Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Alternatively, maybe the step after alkylation is a hydrogenation to a single bond. So prop-1-ynyl becomes propane. Then, perhaps we have a cyclohexylpropane.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent, along with an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then something else happens.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target molecule again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and also a CHO group. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon also has a CHO group. So that would require a geminal di-substitution, which is possible but a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon (position 1) has an aldehyde group. So structure is cyclohexane with a substituent at C1: CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that's a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group that looks like CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon. So the substituent would be CHO attached to a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps it's something like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group with a cyclohexyl substituent, and the same carbon as the substituent is the aldehyde.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure, so maybe I should think about the possible reaction sequences.

Looking at the options:

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne extends to propyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenation to propane.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Wait, but after hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so maybe that step is to break a ring or a double bond. Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, another double bond is formed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Steps 1-4 are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So after step 1, the alkyne becomes a propyne. Step 2: hydrogenation to propane. Now, the molecule is cyclohexylpropane. Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is causing an elimination. But where is the acidic proton? Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps abstracting a proton next to the propane to form an alkene. Wait, but we have a cyclohexane attached to a propane chain. So maybe the Ba(OH)2 is used in a Hofmann elimination or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol formation. Wait, but I don't see any hydroxyl groups yet.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, perhaps I'm off track.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So the acetylide forms, then adds ethyl group, making a longer alkyne. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition. Birch reduction of alkynes can form diols or other products. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation step for elimination. Or perhaps it's a method for forming alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, Li in ammonia is used for deprotonating compounds, like in the formation of Grignard reagents, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after adding the ethyl group, we have a propyne. Then, using Li in NH3 might cause an elimination, forming a double bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkene. Then, step 3 is O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Then step 4, NH4OH is a workup, perhaps to break ozonides into carbonyls.

But let's see: starting with ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, it's a longer alkyne. Step 2: Li in NH3 might deprotonate it to form an alkyne again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a method for creating an alkene from an alkyne. 

Wait, another approach: maybe the overall goal is to introduce a carbonyl group. The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps oxidation is involved. Let's think about each step in each option.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-c; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a workup. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with Zn/H2O or (CH3)2S) would typically give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene. But the starting material after step 2 is hydrogenated alkyne, which is a single bond, so no double bond. So how would ozonolysis work in that case? It wouldn't, unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps after hydrogenation, another double bond is formed. Wait, but where? Maybe the hydrogenation is not complete, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is selective, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. But NaNH2 in methanol... Wait, perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Methanol would act as an electrophile, so the acetylide would attack it. So the alkyne would become CH2-OCH3? Wait, but acetylide is a strong base. Adding methanol might give a methyl ether? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the acetylide would react with methanol to form an ether. So cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, NaNH2 in methanol might deprotonate, but methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option D's step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, which would deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form an ether. So the triple bond would become an ether. But that doesn't seem right, because the acetylide would typically react with an alkyl halide, not an alcohol. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol or a carbonyl group and then introducing the substituents.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and also an aldehyde group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the aldehyde is on the same carbon. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the functional group transformations needed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-ethynyl). The target has an aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a cyclohexyl substituent.

So, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Extend the alkyne by alkylation to form a longer chain.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.
3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.
4. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.
5. Introduce hydroxyl groups.
6. Oxidize to form aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about the starting material. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Let's say the alkyne is at position 1. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then alkylate it. For instance, adding a methyl group would give cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, which is a prop-1-ynylcyclohexane.

Then, hydrogenation (step 2) would convert the alkyne into an alkane: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane.

But the target has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the hydrogenation isn't the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. But that depends on the conditions. For example, hydrogenation with a Lindlar catalyst would give cis addition, while with a poisoned catalyst, it could be trans.

Wait, if we hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis alkene, then ozonolysis could cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But in the target, the substituent is a cyclohexyl, so perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a diene, which could then be used in some cyclopropanation or other reactions. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would typically give diketones, but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's sequence.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Deprotonates the alkyne to form acetylide, which reacts with methanol. But I don't think the acetylide would react with methanol directly. More likely, it would form an ether via an SN2 reaction, but methanol is a poor electrophile here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, maybe the acetylide attacks an alkylating agent. But methanol isn't an alkylating agent. So perhaps this step is for deprotonation only, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 in methanol is used to deprotonate and form the acetylide, which then traps with methanol. But that would give an ether, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product of each step.

Looking again at the options, perhaps the correct reagent sequence involves forming a ketone, then reducing it, then introducing the cyclohexyl group, and so on.

Wait, another approach: the target has a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, hydroxyl, and aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reagent addition or some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, considering the options, option C's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, so ozonolysis followed by (CH3)2S would give aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

So considering option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne extends to propyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate to propane. So now, the molecule is cyclohexylpropane.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. But after step 2, it's a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Unless step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne but does something else. Wait, H2 with Pd-c catalyst typically hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So that would leave no double bond for ozonolysis in step 3. So option C's step 3 doesn't make sense unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. But that's usually done with specific catalysts, like Lindlar's for cis addition, or using a poisoned catalyst for trans. But the option says H2/Pd-c. So perhaps it's a full hydrogenation, making it impossible for ozonolysis in step 3.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a hydroxyl, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, with the aldehyde on the same carbon. So the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO.

Wait, that's impossible because a carbon can't have four bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde is on the adjacent carbon. So, like CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO, but that's still unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2OH group with a cyclohexyl substituent, and the same carbon has an aldehyde. So CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. But that's a quaternary carbon with four substituents: cyclohexane ring, OH, cyclohexyl, and CHO. That's impossible. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl, and the same carbon also has an aldehyde. So the structure would be CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO, which is again a quaternary carbon.

Wait, maybe I should give up on the structure and think about possible reaction pathways.

An alternative approach is to think about the functional groups needed. The target molecule has an aldehyde, a hydroxyl, and a cyclohexyl substituent. So perhaps the steps involve introducing these groups via oxidation, addition, elimination, etc.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the first step is to alkylate the alkyne to make it longer, then hydrogenate to an alkane, then form an alcohol, then oxidize to an aldehyde, and introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how? Let's think about each option.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (propyne).
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH3 (propane).
3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene?
4. Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) → oxidize primary alcohol to carboxylic acid, but where would the alcohol come from?

Wait, but after step 2, we have cyclohexylpropane, which is a straight chain. Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, but without any functional groups, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that requires an amine.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. But Ba(OH)2 isn't typically an oxidizing agent; it's a base. So perhaps it's causing elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is introducing a hydroxyl group via some reaction, but I can't see how.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Et (but-1-ynylcyclohexane).
2. Li/liq. NH3 → maybe deprotonate and eliminate to form an alkene.
3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH → hydrolysis, maybe to form carboxylic acids or ketones.

Hmm, after step 2, we'd have an alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. For example, if the alkene is between carbons 2 and 3, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target structure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → propyne.
2. H2/Pd → propane.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → no double bond, so no reaction.
4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an ether. So the alkyne becomes CH2-OCH3.
Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's deprotonation followed by methanol acting as a methylating agent, but I don't think that's feasible. 

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible steps again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So perhaps the starting alkyne is alkylated to add a cyclohexyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps in step 1, the alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which then reacts with a cyclohexyl halide. But none of the options directly show that. Wait, option A uses methyl chloride, option B ethyl chloride, option C methyl chloride, option D methanol.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a longer chain, then hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then further oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to hydroboration to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then undergoes a dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which is then oxidized or reduced.

Wait, the target has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group. So perhaps oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde.

But the presence of the cyclohexyl group suggests some kind of substitution or addition.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the substituent in the target is formed via a Gabriel synthesis or some other method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkyne extend, then hydrogenate, then introduce a double bond via elimination, then ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about option B again.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Et (but-1-ynylcyclohexane).
2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming an alkene. So the alkyne becomes an alkene.
3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene into two carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH → hydrolysis, perhaps to form carboxylic acids or ketones.

So if step 2 forms an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But let's see: the initial alkyne is CH2-C≡C-Et. If Li in NH3 is used, perhaps it's a Birch reduction condition, which would add hydrogen across the triple bond, forming a cis-alkene. So CH2-CH2-CH2-Et? Wait, no, Birch reduction typically adds hydrogen to triple bonds to form cis-alkenes. So the triple bond becomes a cis double bond.

Wait, so after step 2, the molecule would be CH2-C=C-Et (cis). Then step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Ozonolysis of a cis-alkene would give two aldehyde groups if the ends are CH2 groups. So if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, the structure after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-Et. Birch reduction (Li in NH3) typically reduces alkynes to cis-alkenes. So after step 2, we have CH2-CH2-CH2-Et? No, wait, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, but that's a single bond. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Birch reduction usually adds hydrogen to triple bonds to form trans-alkenes, but I'm not certain.

Wait, Birch reduction is for aromatic rings, usually. For alkynes, maybe a different reaction. Alternatively, Li in ammonia could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then undergoes elimination to form a longer alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in ammonia is causing a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming a more substituted alkyne. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct answer being option C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the reagents that would introduce both the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps an oxidation step is involved. The reagents that cause oxidation include H2SO4, HgSO4 (Jones reagent), or other oxidizing agents.

Looking at the options, options A and C have a Jones-like oxidation step. Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.

Option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps used in elimination or oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, but where would the alcohol come from? Maybe an earlier step introduces an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Let me try to outline a possible synthesis pathway.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane.
2. Deprotonate to form acetylide.
3. Alkylate with methyl chloride to form longer alkyne.
4. Hydrogenate to form a propane chain.
5. Introduce a double bond via elimination, perhaps using a strong base like Ba(OH)2, forming an alkene.
6. Ozonolyse the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
7. Introduce a hydroxyl group via some method, perhaps via epoxidation and acid workup, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne extension via alkylation.
2. Hydrogenate to alkene.
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.
4. Introduce hydroxyl groups via some dihydroxylation.

But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So perhaps a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl compound. But when would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a ketone via oxidation. Ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes another cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening or some kind of coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should look for the correct option based on reagent sequences.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate alkyne to CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → no reaction, as no double bond.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

That doesn't seem right. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an ether.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → Birch reduction, perhaps.

Step 3: O3 → ozonolysis.

But I'm not sure how this would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond (cis or trans), which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups. Then, a Ba(OH)2 step could introduce an hydroxyl group or cause elimination.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, considering that the target has an aldehyde group, which is an oxidized form of an alcohol. So perhaps the steps involve introducing an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps should introduce a ketone group, which is then reduced to an alcohol and then oxidized to an aldehyde. But again, not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking back, option C's steps include ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes. So perhaps after forming an alkene, ozonolysis would create the aldehyde group.

Wait, in option C:

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't work. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option B's steps include Li in NH3, which could form an alkene. Then ozonolysis would work. So let's think:

After step 1, alkyne becomes longer. Step 2: Li in NH3 → forms an alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls. Then NH4OH would hydrolyze any ozonides into carbonyls.

But how does that lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. How is that introduced? Perhaps via a Grignard reagent adding a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl. But in the options, none of the steps include Mg or THF, which are typical for Grignard reagents. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via an alkylation of the acetylide. So step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, making a longer alkyne. Then, perhaps another alkylation step, but in the options, only one alkylation is present.

Hmm.

Given all this confusion, I'll have to pick the option that seems most plausible. I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne of ethynylcyclohexane to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to extend the alkyne to a propyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a propane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but no clear functional group transformation is evident.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones. However, no alcohol is introduced in earlier steps, making this sequence unclear.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, extending the alkyne to a butyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms an alkene via elimination or reduction.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolyzes ozonides into aldehydes or ketones. This sequence could potentially form carbonyl groups, but it does not clearly introduce the hydroxyl or cyclohexyl substituents.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Extends the alkyne to a propyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-c**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a propane chain.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup. However, no double bond is present after step 2, so ozonolysis would not proceed.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but methanol is not a typical alkylating agent, making this step ambiguous.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms an alkene via elimination or reduction.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup. However, the role of methanol in step 1 is unclear, and the sequence does not clearly introduce the hydroxyl or cyclohexyl substituents.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** was considered the most plausible, despite ambiguities in the steps. 

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me see if I can parse its structure. It sounds like it has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane, and there's also a carbaldehyde group (CHO) on the same carbon as the substituent. Wait, no—actually, the numbering might be different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane has a methyl group attached, which itself is connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. And then, there's a carbaldehyde group somewhere else. 

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. So the main ring is cyclohexane. On one of its carbons (probably position 1), there's a substituent that's a methyl group. This methyl is attached to two other groups: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached at position 1. Additionally, there's a CHO (aldehyde) group on that same carbon. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have both an aldehyde and another substituent on the same carbon unless it's a geminal di-substituent, but that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is on another carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which might imply that the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group at position 1. Wait, that's not possible either because a single carbon can't have two substituents besides the cyclohexane ring unless it's a quaternary carbon. Oh wait, wait—maybe the molecule is structured as a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group that's attached to two other groups: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. And the cyclohexane also has a carbaldehyde group at position 1. Hmm, but that would imply that the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached to it. Then, the same carbon where the methyl is attached also has an aldehyde group. Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group. This CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Additionally, perhaps there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon, making it CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that would require the same carbon to have three substituents and the ring, which is possible. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane (another ring) and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon also has an aldehyde group. But I might be getting mixed up. Let me think about the synthesis steps instead.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. The structure is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent. So it's cyclohexyl-ethynyl, perhaps. 

So the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to think about how to get from ethynylcyclohexane to that.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. So I need to add substituents and functional groups to this structure to reach the target.

Hmm. So the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the steps that are usually taken in such syntheses.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li/liq. NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, etc.

Let me think about possible reaction sequences.

Ethynylcyclohexane is a strained alkyne. Reactions with alkynes often involve adding hydrogen or undergoing hydroboration, or maybe other additions.

But looking at the options, step 1 in all options is NaNH2 and something else. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation. For example, in the formation of alkynes from alkenes via elimination, but more commonly, NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction or in deprotonation of terminal alkynes to form lithium acetylides. Wait, when you have a terminal alkyne, like ethynylcyclohexane, treating with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia would deprotonate it to form a lithium acetylide. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. The terminal hydrogen is acidic because of the sp-hybridized carbon. So NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form a cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Li^+.

Then, the next step is adding an alkylating agent. In option A, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Option B uses ethyl chloride. C uses methyl chloride, D uses methanol.

Wait, after forming the acetylide, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it. So adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide. So the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^-Li^+. Adding CH3Cl would give CH2-CCl-CH3? No, wait, the acetylide is the conjugate base. So when you have cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- ), adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Because the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride, CH3Cl, to add a methyl group. So that would make a longer alkyne: (cyclohexyl)propyne, I guess. Wait, propyne would be HC≡C-CH2-... Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So that's a propyne derivative.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let's think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So NaNH2 deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes longer. So from CH2-C≡CH (ethynyl) to CH2-C≡C-CH3 (prop-1-ynylcyclohexane). So now, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a prop-1-ynyl group.

Wait, but in the options, some sequences have more steps. So after alkylation, what's next? Let's look at the options.

Option A: After step 1, NaNH2 and methyl chloride, step 2 is H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of the alkyne. So H2 with palladium as catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So prop-1-ynylcyclohexane becomes propylcyclohexane. So CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem directly helpful. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in the oxidation of alcohols, or in elimination reactions. And step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols to ketones. 

Wait, let me see:

So starting from ethynylcyclohexane:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexylprop-1-ynyl group (but perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, maybe it's CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane?), no, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^-. Then adding CH3Cl would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the alkyne is now a propyne. Then hydrogenation would convert it to a propane group. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then Ba(OH)2, perhaps an elimination reaction. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base, could cause deprotonation and elimination. But in this molecule, if we have a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, perhaps Ba(OH)2 would cause some elimination, but where? Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation step. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, but after hydrogenation, we have a propane chain. Then, without any functional groups, Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much. Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Alternatively, maybe the step after alkylation is a hydrogenation to a single bond. So prop-1-ynyl becomes propane. Then, perhaps we have a cyclohexylpropane.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent, along with an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then something else happens.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target molecule again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and also a CHO group. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon also has a CHO group. So that would require a geminal di-substitution, which is possible but a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon (position 1) has an aldehyde group. So structure is cyclohexane with a substituent at C1: CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that's a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group that looks like CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon. So the substituent would be CHO attached to a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps it's something like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group with a cyclohexyl substituent, and the same carbon as the substituent is the aldehyde.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure, so maybe I should think about the possible reaction sequences.

Looking at the options:

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne extends to propyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenation to propane.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Wait, but after hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so maybe that step is to break a ring or a double bond. Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, another double bond is formed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Steps 1-4 are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So after step 1, the alkyne becomes a propyne. Step 2: hydrogenation to propane. Now, the molecule is cyclohexylpropane. Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is causing an elimination. But where is the acidic proton? Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps abstracting a proton next to the propane to form an alkene. Wait, but we have a cyclohexane attached to a propane chain. So maybe the Ba(OH)2 is used in a Hofmann elimination or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol formation. Wait, but I don't see any hydroxyl groups yet.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, perhaps I'm off track.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So the acetylide forms, then adds ethyl group, making a longer alkyne. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition. Birch reduction of alkynes can form diols or other products. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation step for elimination. Or perhaps it's a method for forming alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, Li in ammonia is used for deprotonating compounds, like in the formation of Grignard reagents, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after adding the ethyl group, we have a propyne. Then, using Li in NH3 might cause an elimination, forming a double bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkene. Then, step 3 is O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Then step 4, NH4OH is a workup, perhaps to break ozonides into carbonyls.

But let's see: starting with ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, it's a longer alkyne. Step 2: Li in NH3 might deprotonate it to form an alkyne again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a method for creating an alkene from an alkyne. 

Wait, another approach: maybe the overall goal is to introduce a carbonyl group. The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps oxidation is involved. Let's think about each step in each option.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-c; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a workup. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with Zn/H2O or (CH3)2S) would typically give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene. But the starting material after step 2 is hydrogenated alkyne, which is a single bond, so no double bond. So how would ozonolysis work in that case? It wouldn't, unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps after hydrogenation, another double bond is formed. Wait, but where? Maybe the hydrogenation is not complete, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is selective, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. But NaNH2 in methanol... Wait, perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Methanol would act as an electrophile, so the acetylide would attack it. So the alkyne would become CH2-OCH3? Wait, but acetylide is a strong base. Adding methanol might give a methyl ether? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the acetylide would react with methanol to form an ether. So cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, NaNH2 in methanol might deprotonate, but methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option D's step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, which would deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form an ether. So the triple bond would become an ether. But that doesn't seem right, because the acetylide would typically react with an alkyl halide, not an alcohol. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol or a carbonyl group and then introducing the substituents.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and also an aldehyde group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the aldehyde is on the same carbon. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the functional group transformations needed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-ethynyl). The target has an aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a cyclohexyl substituent.

So, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Extend the alkyne by alkylation to form a longer chain.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.
3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.
4. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.
5. Introduce hydroxyl groups.
6. Oxidize to form aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about the starting material. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Let's say the alkyne is at position 1. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then alkylate it. For instance, adding a methyl group would give cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, which is a prop-1-ynylcyclohexane.

Then, hydrogenation (step 2) would convert the alkyne into an alkane: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane.

But the target has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the hydrogenation isn't the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. But that depends on the conditions. For example, hydrogenation with a Lindlar catalyst would give cis addition, while with a poisoned catalyst, it could be trans.

Wait, if we hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis alkene, then ozonolysis could cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But in the target, the substituent is a cyclohexyl, so perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a diene, which could then be used in some cyclopropanation or other reactions. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would typically give diketones, but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's sequence.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Deprotonates the alkyne to form acetylide, which reacts with methanol. But I don't think the acetylide would react with methanol directly. More likely, it would form an ether via an SN2 reaction, but methanol is a poor electrophile here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, maybe the acetylide attacks an alkylating agent. But methanol isn't an alkylating agent. So perhaps this step is for deprotonation only, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 in methanol is used to deprotonate and form the acetylide, which then traps with methanol. But that would give an ether, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product of each step.

Looking again at the options, perhaps the correct reagent sequence involves forming a ketone, then reducing it, then introducing the cyclohexyl group, and so on.

Wait, another approach: the target has a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, hydroxyl, and aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reagent addition or some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, considering the options, option C's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, so ozonolysis followed by (CH3)2S would give aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

So considering option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne extends to propyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate to propane. So now, the molecule is cyclohexylpropane.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. But after step 2, it's a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Unless step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne but does something else. Wait, H2 with Pd-c catalyst typically hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So that would leave no double bond for ozonolysis in step 3. So option C's step 3 doesn't make sense unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. But that's usually done with specific catalysts, like Lindlar's for cis addition, or using a poisoned catalyst for trans. But the option says H2/Pd-c. So perhaps it's a full hydrogenation, making it impossible for ozonolysis in step 3.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a hydroxyl, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, with the aldehyde on the same carbon. So the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO.

Wait, that's impossible because a carbon can't have four bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde is on the adjacent carbon. So, like CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO, but that's still unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2OH group with a cyclohexyl substituent, and the same carbon has an aldehyde. So CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. But that's a quaternary carbon with four substituents: cyclohexane ring, OH, cyclohexyl, and CHO. That's impossible. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl, and the same carbon also has an aldehyde. So the structure would be CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO, which is again a quaternary carbon.

Wait, maybe I should give up on the structure and think about possible reaction pathways.

An alternative approach is to think about the functional groups needed. The target molecule has an aldehyde, a hydroxyl, and a cyclohexyl substituent. So perhaps the steps involve introducing these groups via oxidation, addition, elimination, etc.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the first step is to alkylate the alkyne to make it longer, then hydrogenate to an alkane, then form an alcohol, then oxidize to an aldehyde, and introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how? Let's think about each option.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (propyne).
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH3 (propane).
3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene?
4. Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) → oxidize primary alcohol to carboxylic acid, but where would the alcohol come from?

Wait, but after step 2, we have cyclohexylpropane, which is a straight chain. Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, but without any functional groups, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that requires an amine.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. But Ba(OH)2 isn't typically an oxidizing agent; it's a base. So perhaps it's causing elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is introducing a hydroxyl group via some reaction, but I can't see how.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Et (but-1-ynylcyclohexane).
2. Li/liq. NH3 → maybe deprotonate and eliminate to form an alkene.
3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH → hydrolysis, maybe to form carboxylic acids or ketones.

Hmm, after step 2, we'd have an alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. For example, if the alkene is between carbons 2 and 3, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target structure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → propyne.
2. H2/Pd → propane.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → no double bond, so no reaction.
4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an ether. So the alkyne becomes CH2-OCH3.
Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's deprotonation followed by methanol acting as a methylating agent, but I don't think that's feasible. 

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible steps again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So perhaps the starting alkyne is alkylated to add a cyclohexyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps in step 1, the alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which then reacts with a cyclohexyl halide. But none of the options directly show that. Wait, option A uses methyl chloride, option B ethyl chloride, option C methyl chloride, option D methanol.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a longer chain, then hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then further oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to hydroboration to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then undergoes a dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which is then oxidized or reduced.

Wait, the target has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group. So perhaps oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde.

But the presence of the cyclohexyl group suggests some kind of substitution or addition.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the substituent in the target is formed via a Gabriel synthesis or some other method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkyne extend, then hydrogenate, then introduce a double bond via elimination, then ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about option B again.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Et (but-1-ynylcyclohexane).
2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming an alkene. So the alkyne becomes an alkene.
3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene into two carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH → hydrolysis, perhaps to form carboxylic acids or ketones.

So if step 2 forms an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But let's see: the initial alkyne is CH2-C≡C-Et. If Li in NH3 is used, perhaps it's a Birch reduction condition, which would add hydrogen across the triple bond, forming a cis-alkene. So CH2-CH2-CH2-Et? Wait, no, Birch reduction typically adds hydrogen to triple bonds to form cis-alkenes. So the triple bond becomes a cis double bond.

Wait, so after step 2, the molecule would be CH2-C=C-Et (cis). Then step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Ozonolysis of a cis-alkene would give two aldehyde groups if the ends are CH2 groups. So if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, the structure after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-Et. Birch reduction (Li in NH3) typically reduces alkynes to cis-alkenes. So after step 2, we have CH2-CH2-CH2-Et? No, wait, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, but that's a single bond. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Birch reduction usually adds hydrogen to triple bonds to form trans-alkenes, but I'm not certain.

Wait, Birch reduction is for aromatic rings, usually. For alkynes, maybe a different reaction. Alternatively, Li in ammonia could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then undergoes elimination to form a longer alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in ammonia is causing a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming a more substituted alkyne. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct answer being option C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the reagents that would introduce both the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps an oxidation step is involved. The reagents that cause oxidation include H2SO4, HgSO4 (Jones reagent), or other oxidizing agents.

Looking at the options, options A and C have a Jones-like oxidation step. Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.

Option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps used in elimination or oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, but where would the alcohol come from? Maybe an earlier step introduces an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Let me try to outline a possible synthesis pathway.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane.
2. Deprotonate to form acetylide.
3. Alkylate with methyl chloride to form longer alkyne.
4. Hydrogenate to form a propane chain.
5. Introduce a double bond via elimination, perhaps using a strong base like Ba(OH)2, forming an alkene.
6. Ozonolyse the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
7. Introduce a hydroxyl group via some method, perhaps via epoxidation and acid workup, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne extension via alkylation.
2. Hydrogenate to alkene.
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.
4. Introduce hydroxyl groups via some dihydroxylation.

But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So perhaps a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl compound. But when would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a ketone via oxidation. Ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes another cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening or some kind of coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should look for the correct option based on reagent sequences.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate alkyne to CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → no reaction, as no double bond.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

That doesn't seem right. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an ether.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → Birch reduction, perhaps.

Step 3: O3 → ozonolysis.

But I'm not sure how this would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond (cis or trans), which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups. Then, a Ba(OH)2 step could introduce an hydroxyl group or cause elimination.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, considering that the target has an aldehyde group, which is an oxidized form of an alcohol. So perhaps the steps involve introducing an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps should introduce a ketone group, which is then reduced to an alcohol and then oxidized to an aldehyde. But again, not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking back, option C's steps include ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes. So perhaps after forming an alkene, ozonolysis would create the aldehyde group.

Wait, in option C:

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't work. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option B's steps include Li in NH3, which could form an alkene. Then ozonolysis would work. So let's think:

After step 1, alkyne becomes longer. Step 2: Li in NH3 → forms an alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls. Then NH4OH would hydrolyze any ozonides into carbonyls.

But how does that lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. How is that introduced? Perhaps via a Grignard reagent adding a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl. But in the options, none of the steps include Mg or THF, which are typical for Grignard reagents. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via an alkylation of the acetylide. So step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, making a longer alkyne. Then, perhaps another alkylation step, but in the options, only one alkylation is present.

Hmm.

Given all this confusion, I'll have to pick the option that seems most plausible. I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne of ethynylcyclohexane to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to extend the alkyne to a propyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a propane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but no clear functional group transformation is evident.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones. However, no alcohol is introduced in earlier steps, making this sequence unclear.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, extending the alkyne to a butyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms an alkene via elimination or reduction.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolyzes ozonides into aldehydes or ketones. This sequence could potentially form carbonyl groups, but it does not clearly introduce the hydroxyl or cyclohexyl substituents.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Extends the alkyne to a propyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-c**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a propane chain.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup. However, no double bond is present after step 2, so ozonolysis would not proceed.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but methanol is not a typical alkylating agent, making this step ambiguous.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms an alkene via elimination or reduction.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup. However, the role of methanol in step 1 is unclear, and the sequence does not clearly introduce the hydroxyl or cyclohexyl substituents.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** was considered the most plausible, despite ambiguities in the steps.
