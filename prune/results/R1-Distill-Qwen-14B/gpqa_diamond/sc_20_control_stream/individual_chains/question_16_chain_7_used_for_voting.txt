Okay, so I have this question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's a chiral center, but wait, there are other possibilities too. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So, it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2, or wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is ClC(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene. Oh, so structure must be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, but it's double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but that's not correct. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. And 2-methyl would add a CH3 to C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is four carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So 1-chloro is on C1. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl on C1, double bond to CH(CH3) on C2, then two more CH2 groups? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So replacing the H on C1 with Cl gives CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3, but wait that's not with a double bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but that would make it a three-carbon chain? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group. So structure is Cl-C(R)=CH-CH2CH3? Hmm.

But regardless of the structure, the key is whether it has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, but for optical activity, compounds can also be optically active if they have a plane of asymmetry without a chiral center. But wait, no, in reality, optical activity arises from chirality, which requires either a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a chiral axis or plane. But for the purpose of this question, maybe we're only considering chiral centers. Because some of the other methods are more complicated.

So going back to the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Does it have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, perhaps not. Because the Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)), so the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but in that case, C2 is CH(CH3), attached to double bond. So the molecule is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but then C2 has two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Let me try again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure should be Cl attached to C1, methyl to C2, with double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's five carbons? No, wait. Wait, but butane is four carbons. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would have a methyl on C2. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's four carbons. So the molecule is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be three carbons? Oh, no, but wait: but-1-ene is four carbons, but the substituents are on C1 and C2. So the structure would be: CH2Cl on C1, which is double bonded to CH(CH3) on C2, then followed by CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4 are just CH2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because that's a single bond. Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's only four carbons. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH3. So that would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? No, wait, that can't be because butane is four carbons. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's five.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of substituents. The molecule has a double bond at position 1, with Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So, the molecule would have Cl, CH2, and then two substituents on C2 (CH(CH3)) and perhaps another CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the actual structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons: Cl is on C1, C2 is CH(CH3) (but wait, in the double bond, C2 can only have two substituents besides the double bond). So perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and perhaps another substituent, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So adding Cl to C1 would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's without the double bond. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should just figure if the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, in a double bond, the substituents on each carbon are considered. But for a chiral center, each carbon must have four different groups. So, assuming the first compound has a double bond, let's see if any of the carbons are chiral centers. The structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, CH2, and two substituents from the double bond. Wait, maybe C2 is the one with the methyl. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is four carbons. So C1: Cl, CH2; C2: CH(CH3), double bond; C3: CH2; C4: CH3? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. In that case, C2 is CH(CH3) with a double bond on either side. So for C2, what are the substituents? It's connected to ClCH2 on one side, CH3, and double bonds to C1 and C3. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So for C2, substituents are ClCH2, CH3, and two double bonds (which are each to C1 and C3). So that's four groups? No, because the double bonds are between C1 and C2 and between C2 and C3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps C2 has a CH3 and a double bond, making the substituents ClCH2, CH3, and two double bonds. No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps this molecule is not chiral because the double bond may make it planar, and without any chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond, which can't be because it's but-1-ene. So perhaps there's no chiral center, so it's not optically active. Or maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is such that it's a cis or trans isomer, but that doesn't affect optical activity. So, I'm thinking the first compound may not be chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Optical activity can come from a chiral center or from other forms of chirality, like a planar chirality. But for the purpose of this question, let's focus on chiral centers.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a mouthful. Let me think. Methanoisobenzofuran would be a bicyclic structure with a fused ring. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2-. So it's attached to position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration indicates that the chloromethylene group is opposite in configuration. But I'm not sure if this structure has a chiral center. Or maybe the entire molecule is chiral due to the bicyclic structure and substituents. Alternatively, the substituents may make the molecule have a plane of symmetry or not. Hmm. Well, considering the substituents and the ring structure, it's possible that this molecule has a chiral center. Especially since the substituents are on the ring at specific positions. So this compound might be chiral. So optical activity is possible here.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If we have methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure would be HOOC-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 would make it HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, no, let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because 2 and 3 are the middle carbons. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons has a methyl group. So each of these central carbons (C2 and C3) are CH(CH3) groups. Wait, but in that case, each carbon would have two methyl groups, making them not chiral. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The backbone is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So each of those CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). Each of these would have substituents: for C2, it's connected to the HOOC, a CH(CH3) (from C3), two CH3 groups, and the adjacent C. Wait, no, each central carbon is CH(CH3). So let's see: C2 has groups: HOOC, CH(CH3), two CH3? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the CH(CH3) carbons is connected to two methyl groups, the succinic acid backbone, and the adjacent carbons. So for each of these carbons, the substituents would be: two CH3 groups, a CH(CH3) from the other side, and the two oxygens from the carboxylic acids. Wait, no, the backbone is a four-carbon chain. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to two CH3 groups, the adjacent carbons, and the COOH groups. So, for each, the substituents are: two methyl groups, the adjacent CH(CH3), and the COOH group. Wait, does that give four different substituents? Let me see: C2 has a methyl, another methyl, the COOH group on one side (from C1), and the CH(CH3) from C3. So that's two methyls, one COOH, and CH(CH3). So that's four substituents? No, wait, COOH is on C1, which is connected to C2. So C2's substituents are: the COOH (C1), the two methyl groups, and the C3 (which is CH(CH3)). So for C2, the groups are:

- COOH (from C1)
- two CH3 groups
- C3 (which is CH(CH3))

Wait, so that's three substituents: COOH, CH3, CH(CH3). No, wait, each carbon has four bonds. So, C2 is connected to:

- One COOH (on C1: the carbon before is C1-OOC)
- Two CH3 groups
- One CH(CH3) (C3)
- And perhaps another hydrogen? Wait, no, because it's CH(CH3), meaning it's a CH2 group with a methyl. Wait, no, in this case, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons has a methyl. So each is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- two methyl groups (since it's CH(CH3), which is connected to two CH3 groups and two adjacent carbons)
Wait, no. Wait, CH(CH3) is connected to one methyl group and two other carbons, perhaps. Wait, no, maybe each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), so each has one methyl, and two other CH(CH3) groups. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has one methyl group, and the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons. But in any case, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in this case, let's look at C2. It has:

- two methyl groups (same)
- a COOH group from C1
- a connection to C3 (which is CH(CH3))

So, substituents are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3. So that's three different groups, but wait, two are CH3, so it can't be a chiral center. Because two substituents are the same. So C2 has two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has the same situation. So both C2 and C3 are not chiral. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. But wait, wait, the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. If the substituents on C2 and C3 are arranged in a way that makes each a chiral center, then it would have optical activity.

Wait, wait, each of C2 and C3 would have four substituents. Let's see: C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), two CH3 groups, and C3. So:

Substituents of C2: COOH, CH3, CH3, and CH(CH3) (from C3). So two substituents are CH3, so not four different. So C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly for C3. So the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active. But wait, the question says (2R,3S), so perhaps they are chiral centers. Did I make a mistake in my analysis? Because if each of C2 and C3 has four different substituents, then they would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in the structure. Let me reevaluate. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons has:

- One methyl group (since it's CH(CH3)), so that's one substituent.
- Two CH(CH3) groups from adjacent carbons? No. Wait, each carbon is connected to:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has three substituents: one methyl, and two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3). So for C2, the substituents are:

- C1: which is (HOOC-CH2-) or perhaps COOH is on C1, which is a CH(CH3). Wait, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents: two methyl groups, a COOH, and another carbon. No, that can't be because each middle carbon is a CH(CH3), which is a CH2 with a methyl. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In that case, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- One methyl group
- Two CH(CH3) groups (from adjacent carbons)
- And a carboxylic acid group (from C1 and C4)

Wait, but each middle carbon is connected to:

C2: connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups.

Wait, that would mean substituents: COOH (on C1), two methyl groups, and the CH(CH3) on C3. So four substituents? No, each carbon has four bonds. So C2 has:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two methyl groups.

That's four groups: COOH, CH(CH3), methyl, methyl. So two are the same. So C2 is not a chiral center. Same for C3. Therefore, the molecule lacks chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the configuration is given, which suggests that each of C2 and C3 is a chiral center. But according to my analysis, that's not possible because they have two identical substituents (two methyl groups). So perhaps I'm missing something in the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each of C2 and C3 has four different groups. Let me think again. If each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups, a COOH group, and the adjacent CH(CH3), then no, they're not chiral. But if the structure is different, perhaps the substituents are different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe the substituents on C2 and C3 are not methyl but something else. No, the compound is 2,3-dimethyl, so they're methyl groups. Hmm. So I think this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

But wait, the question gives it as (2R,3S), which implies each is a chiral center. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let's try to imagine the structure. The molecule is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So each has:

- One methyl group
- One connection to the COOH group on C1
- One connection to the adjacent carbon (C3 or C2)
- And another group. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has three substituents: methyl, C1, and C3. But that's only three groups. So perhaps each of the middle carbons has a hydrogen as well. So, the substituents would be:

C2: methyl, COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different substituents: methyl, COOH, CH(CH3), and H. So that would make C2 a chiral center. Oh! I think I see now. Because each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), which implies that in addition to the methyl and the two adjacent carbons, there's a hydrogen attached. So each of the CH(CH3) groups has a hydrogen. So the substituents on C2 would be:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- methyl
- hydrogen.

So four different substituents. That makes C2 a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would have:

- COOH (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- methyl
- hydrogen.

So, C3 is also a chiral center. Thus, the molecule has two chiral centers, and the configurations are R and S respectively. So this compound is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Hmm, okay, so I was wrong earlier. So third compound has two chiral centers, so it is optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same structure as the third compound but with (2R,3R) configuration. So, does it have optical activity? Well, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Wait, in this case, if it's (2R,3R), would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's think. For example, if the configurations are both R, but the molecule is symmetrical. Let me visualize the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with each middle carbon being CH(CH3) with a hydrogen. So, if both C2 and C3 are R configurations, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule. If both chiral centers are R, then flipping the molecule over might not change anything because of the symmetry. Wait, but the configuration is (2R,3R), so perhaps the molecule is not chiral. Wait, no, because each chiral center has four different substituents. So the molecule would still be chiral even with (2R,3R) configuration. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then maybe it's not chiral. Let me think: the molecule is symmetrical around the C2-C3 axis. So if C2 and C3 have the same configuration, say both R, then the molecule might be achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, that depends on the mirror image. Wait, if you have both R configurations, the molecule could be superimposable on its mirror image if there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the molecule is meso. Because if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, in the case of (2R,3R), if the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound and thus not optically active.

Wait, let me think again. In the third compound, (2R,3S), the configurations are different. So the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. But in the fourth compound, (2R,3R), the configurations are same, but perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So would that make it a meso compound?

Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If both C2 and C3 are R, does that create a plane of symmetry? Let's consider the mirror plane that goes through the middle of the molecule. If the configurations are (R,R), then the mirror image would have (S,S), but the actual molecule is (R,R), so it wouldn't be superimposable. Wait, no, because the mirror image would flip the configuration. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the mirror image would be the same as the original. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps (2R,3R) would lead to a meso compound because the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. 

Wait, so for a molecule to be meso, it must have multiple chiral centers but also a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the (2R,3R) configuration leads to a plane of symmetry, the molecule is meso and thus not chiral. So the fourth compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but how? Let me think of tartaric acid as an example. The meso form of tartaric acid is (2R,3R), which is achiral. So similarly, if this molecule is a meso form, then it's not optically active. So in the fourth compound, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound, so no optical activity.

So third compound has (2R,3S), which is chiral, so optical activity. Fourth is (2R,3R), which is meso, so no optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So cyclohexene with an alcohol group on C1 and a double bond at C3. The configuration is R. So, does this molecule have a chiral center? The cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a hydroxyl group on C1. So the structure is cyclohexene with OH on C1. The configuration is R, which implies that C1 is a chiral center. Because the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH group
- The cyclohexene ring (with double bond)
- Two CH2 groups (maybe)

Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. Then, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH group
- The ring (which includes C2, C6, and the double bond at C3)
- CH2 groups from the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

At C1: OH, ring (with substituents), and two other CH2 groups. So if the ring structure makes the substituents different, then C1 is a chiral center. So in (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is at C3. So the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. But I'm not sure if that's enough to make it a chiral center.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. C1 has:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6)
- And the ring structure, which includes the double bond at C3.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

1. OH
2. CH2- (to C2)
3. CH2- (to C6)
4. The rest of the ring (which includes the double bond at C3, so it's a cyclohexene ring).

Wait, but in reality, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to adjacent carbons)
- And the ring's structure, which includes the double bond.

But for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

1. OH
2. CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 (but that's not accurate; it's a ring)
Wait, perhaps each substituent is a unique group. Let me think of it as:

C1 is connected to:

- OH
- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C6)
- And the ring structure, which is part of the cyclohexene. 

Wait, but the ring itself is a cyclohexene, so the groups attached to C1 are the same on both sides of the ring. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (which are identical)
- The cyclohexene ring.

Wait, that would mean that two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups leading to C2 and C6), so C1 would not be a chiral center. But wait, that can't be right because in the molecule, C1 has the OH group and is connected to two carbons in the ring. Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2-CH2- (from C2)
- CH2-CH2- (from C6)
- And the double bond at C3.

No, perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different. Because the ring is connected in a way that each adjacent group is unique. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two -CH2- groups that are part of the ring (but perhaps not identical)
- And a bridge or something else.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's C1 is a chiral center. If the configuration is R, then it must have four different groups. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two different CH2 groups (like being on different sides of the double bond)
- And another group from the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are all different, making C1 a chiral center. So, the compound (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center at C1, making it optically active.

But wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the double bond is at C3, then the substituents on either side of the ring could make the molecule symmetrical. So, perhaps C1 isn't a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring has a chair conformation, and the substituents are arranged in a way that makes C1 a chiral center. So, I think I'm leaning towards this compound being chiral because it has an R configuration, implying a chiral center. So, this compound would have optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So cyclohexane with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. So, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. Each of these hydroxyl-bearing carbons: are they chiral centers? Let's look at C1. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6)
- And another group from the ring.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two others. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6)
- And a CH group (to C6 and C2? Not sure).

Wait, perhaps each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5) has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Let me think: For C1, substituents would be:

1. OH
2. CH2 (to C2)
3. CH2 (to C6)
4. The rest of the ring, which includes C5 and other groups.

Wait, but in reality, the substituents could be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to adjacent carbons)
- And the ring's structure, which includes the other hydroxyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are all different. Because C1 is connected to two different CH2 groups (C2 and C6), an OH, and the ring. So, perhaps each of these (C1, C3, C5) are chiral centers. So this molecule has three chiral centers. But whether it's optically active depends on whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, but with all three substituents (OH) on the same side (all s), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, in a chair conformation, if the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the configurations create a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be achiral despite having chiral centers.

Wait, for example, consider a cyclohexane with three substituents, each in s configuration. If the substituents are placed in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, it could be a meso compound. So, perhaps this molecule is not chiral, making it not optically active.

Alternatively, maybe it's chiral. Let me think: (1s,3s,5s) might lead to a non-symmetrical arrangement. Because if all are s, then each substituent is in a specific orientation.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll make a guess. Let's imagine the molecule is such that the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically. For example, if they are all axial and placed at 120 degrees apart, the molecule might have a three-fold axis of symmetry, making it not chiral. Alternatively, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, no, because a three-fold axis would mean the molecule is symmetrical, hence achiral. So, if the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry, it's not chiral. But, in reality, I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps each of the OH groups is on a different position, and the molecule isn't symmetrical, making it chiral.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make a decision here. Maybe this molecule is chiral because it has three chiral centers without any plane of symmetry. So it would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it wouldn't. So, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration leads to symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical across a plane, making it a meso compound. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of a specific example. For instance, in a cyclohexane with substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if each substituent is the same, then it's a meso compound. So, if the substituents are all the same (like OH), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a meso compound and thus not optically active.

Wait, but wait, the configurations are all s. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are all on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they're all on the same side, the mirror image would be the same, making it achiral.

Thus, I think this molecule is not chiral, so no optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure-wise, it's a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at C1). So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). Hmm. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- Cyclopentyl group
- Ketone (C=O)
- Two CH2 groups (from the chain)

Wait, but in butan-1-one, the ketone is on C1. So, C1 is the carbonyl carbon. So, substituents on C1 would be:

- Cyclopentyl group
- O=C-
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C3?)

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3C=O. So, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. So, the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's pentan-1-one with a cyclopentyl substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The formula is C5H9 (cyclopentyl) attached to C1 of butan-1-one, which is (CH2)3-C=O.

So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be pentan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-2. I'm not sure, but the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking for a chiral center, let's see. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. Then, other carbons in the chain: C2, C3, etc. Let's see.

The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the structure would be:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-2.

Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So, substituting the C1 with cyclopentyl and C3 with methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Hmm, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)).

Wait, no, but the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, substituting C1 with cyclopentyl and C3 with methyl would give:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH3)(cyclopentyl)-CH3?

No, I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it differently. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one has four carbons with the ketone on C1. So:

C1: carbonyl carbon (O=C-)
C2: CH2
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: CH3

So, if C1 is substituted with a cyclopentyl group, the structure becomes O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Wait, but that would be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon can't be a chiral center. C2 is CH2, so not chiral. C3 is CH(CH3), so substituents:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH3 (from CH(CH3))
- CH3 (from C4)
- And the cyclopentyl group?

Wait, no, C3 has substituents:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH3 (from the methyl group)
- CH3 (from C4)
- And cyclopentyl? No, C3 is connected to C2, C4, and a methyl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, C3 is connected to C2, C4, and a methyl. So substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, but that would make four substituents, but it's a CH(CH3) group. So substituents:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And what else? Maybe a hydrogen? No, because it's CH(CH3), which implies:

Structure at C3: CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3
- And a hydrogen.

So, substituents on C3 are CH2, CH2, CH3, H. Two are CH2, so C3 is not a chiral center. So, no chiral centers in this molecule, so no optical activity.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are different. For example, if the cyclopentyl group is attached in a way that makes C2 or C3 a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached to C2, making it a chiral center. Hmm, but that's not what the question says. The question states it's 1-cyclopentyl, so it's attached to C1.

So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Now, let's count how many compounds are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-...: Yes.
4. (2R,3R)-...: No.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No.

So, compounds 2,3,5 are optically active. That's three compounds. Wait, but the options start from 2,3,5 as three. But wait, let me check my earlier analysis again.

Wait, earlier I thought:

- Compound 1: No.
- Compound 2: Yes.
- Compound 3: Yes.
- Compound 4: No.
- Compound 5: Yes.
- Compound 6: No.
- Compound 7: No.

So that's three compounds (2,3,5) that are optically active.

But wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought compound 5, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, has a chiral center. So that's three. But looking back, perhaps compound 6 is achiral because of symmetry. So, the total is three.

Wait, but let me check again for each compound.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. Yes.

4. No.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

So, three compounds (2,3,5) are optically active.

Wait, but let me check the first compound again. Did I make a mistake earlier?

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Structure: Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but in this structure, both C1 and C2 are connected to the double bond. So, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because it's planar around the double bond. But wait, could there be a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the CH2 group is attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)). The rest is CH2 and CH3. Are any of the carbons chiral?

C1: Cl, CH2, double bonds to C2 (so two substituents). So C1 has:

- Cl
- CH2
- Double bond to C2 (so substituents would be C2's groups)

Wait, perhaps C2 has substituents that could make it a chiral center. C2 has:

- CH(CH3)
- Double bond to C1 and C3.

So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (from CH(CH3))
- Double bond to C1
- Double bond to C3
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center at C2. Let me think: C2 is connected to:

- CH3 (from CH(CH3))
- Double bond to C1 (Cl-CH2-)
- Double bond to C3 (CH2-CH3)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms. So, for C2, it's bonded to C1 (Cl-CH2-), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and a double bond to C3 (CH2CH3). So, substituents would be Cl-CH2-, CH3, and double bonds. Hmm, perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center because it's part of a double bond, making it planar. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical activity.

So, to sum up:

Optically active compounds: 2,3,5 → three.

So, the answer is option B) 3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. Optical activity arises when a compound has chirality, which can occur due to the presence of a chiral center, a plane of asymmetry, or another form of chirality. Here's the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
The structure is **Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2**. The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, and no carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Specifically, C1 has substituents Cl, CH2, and two bonds to C2 (part of the double bond), while C2 has substituents CH3, CH2, and two bonds to C1. Since no chiral center exists, the molecule is not optically active.

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
This is a bicyclic compound with a complex structure. The substituents and stereochemistry suggest that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical activity.

---

### 3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
The structure is **HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents: a carboxylic acid group, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon. This makes both C2 and C3 chiral centers. Since the configurations are (2R,3S), the molecule is chiral and optically active.

---

### 4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
The structure is the same as in compound 3, but with configurations (2R,3R). In this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

---

### 5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
The structure is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1 and a double bond at C3. The configuration is (R), which implies that C1 is a chiral center. C1 has four different substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. Since it is a chiral center, the molecule is optically active.

---

### 6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
The structure is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups (-OH) on C1, C3, and C5, all in the (s) configuration. While the molecule has three chiral centers, the (1s,3s,5s) configuration introduces a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is not optically active.

---

### 7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is **O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3**. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. C2 and C3 are CH2 and CH(CH3) groups, respectively, and neither has four different substituents. Thus, the molecule lacks chirality and is not optically active.

---

### Conclusion
Compounds 2, 3, and 5 are optically active due to chirality. Compounds 1, 4, 6, and 7 are not optically active. 

**Total optically active compounds: 3**

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's a chiral center, but wait, there are other possibilities too. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So, it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2, or wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is ClC(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene. Oh, so structure must be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, but it's double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but that's not correct. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. And 2-methyl would add a CH3 to C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is four carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So 1-chloro is on C1. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl on C1, double bond to CH(CH3) on C2, then two more CH2 groups? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So replacing the H on C1 with Cl gives CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3, but wait that's not with a double bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but that would make it a three-carbon chain? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group. So structure is Cl-C(R)=CH-CH2CH3? Hmm.

But regardless of the structure, the key is whether it has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, but for optical activity, compounds can also be optically active if they have a plane of asymmetry without a chiral center. But wait, no, in reality, optical activity arises from chirality, which requires either a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a chiral axis or plane. But for the purpose of this question, maybe we're only considering chiral centers. Because some of the other methods are more complicated.

So going back to the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Does it have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, perhaps not. Because the Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)), so the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but in that case, C2 is CH(CH3), attached to double bond. So the molecule is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but then C2 has two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Let me try again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure should be Cl attached to C1, methyl to C2, with double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's five carbons? No, wait. Wait, but butane is four carbons. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would have a methyl on C2. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's four carbons. So the molecule is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be three carbons? Oh, no, but wait: but-1-ene is four carbons, but the substituents are on C1 and C2. So the structure would be: CH2Cl on C1, which is double bonded to CH(CH3) on C2, then followed by CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4 are just CH2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because that's a single bond. Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's only four carbons. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH3. So that would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? No, wait, that can't be because butane is four carbons. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's five.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of substituents. The molecule has a double bond at position 1, with Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So, the molecule would have Cl, CH2, and then two substituents on C2 (CH(CH3)) and perhaps another CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the actual structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons: Cl is on C1, C2 is CH(CH3) (but wait, in the double bond, C2 can only have two substituents besides the double bond). So perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and perhaps another substituent, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So adding Cl to C1 would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's without the double bond. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should just figure if the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, in a double bond, the substituents on each carbon are considered. But for a chiral center, each carbon must have four different groups. So, assuming the first compound has a double bond, let's see if any of the carbons are chiral centers. The structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, CH2, and two substituents from the double bond. Wait, maybe C2 is the one with the methyl. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is four carbons. So C1: Cl, CH2; C2: CH(CH3), double bond; C3: CH2; C4: CH3? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. In that case, C2 is CH(CH3) with a double bond on either side. So for C2, what are the substituents? It's connected to ClCH2 on one side, CH3, and double bonds to C1 and C3. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So for C2, substituents are ClCH2, CH3, and two double bonds (which are each to C1 and C3). So that's four groups? No, because the double bonds are between C1 and C2 and between C2 and C3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps C2 has a CH3 and a double bond, making the substituents ClCH2, CH3, and two double bonds. No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps this molecule is not chiral because the double bond may make it planar, and without any chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's a single bond, which can't be because it's but-1-ene. So perhaps there's no chiral center, so it's not optically active. Or maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is such that it's a cis or trans isomer, but that doesn't affect optical activity. So, I'm thinking the first compound may not be chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Optical activity can come from a chiral center or from other forms of chirality, like a planar chirality. But for the purpose of this question, let's focus on chiral centers.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a mouthful. Let me think. Methanoisobenzofuran would be a bicyclic structure with a fused ring. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2-. So it's attached to position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration indicates that the chloromethylene group is opposite in configuration. But I'm not sure if this structure has a chiral center. Or maybe the entire molecule is chiral due to the bicyclic structure and substituents. Alternatively, the substituents may make the molecule have a plane of symmetry or not. Hmm. Well, considering the substituents and the ring structure, it's possible that this molecule has a chiral center. Especially since the substituents are on the ring at specific positions. So this compound might be chiral. So optical activity is possible here.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If we have methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure would be HOOC-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 would make it HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, no, let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because 2 and 3 are the middle carbons. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons has a methyl group. So each of these central carbons (C2 and C3) are CH(CH3) groups. Wait, but in that case, each carbon would have two methyl groups, making them not chiral. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The backbone is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So each of those CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). Each of these would have substituents: for C2, it's connected to the HOOC, a CH(CH3) (from C3), two CH3 groups, and the adjacent C. Wait, no, each central carbon is CH(CH3). So let's see: C2 has groups: HOOC, CH(CH3), two CH3? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the CH(CH3) carbons is connected to two methyl groups, the succinic acid backbone, and the adjacent carbons. So for each of these carbons, the substituents would be: two CH3 groups, a CH(CH3) from the other side, and the two oxygens from the carboxylic acids. Wait, no, the backbone is a four-carbon chain. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to two CH3 groups, the adjacent carbons, and the COOH groups. So, for each, the substituents are: two methyl groups, the adjacent CH(CH3), and the COOH group. Wait, does that give four different substituents? Let me see: C2 has a methyl, another methyl, the COOH group on one side (from C1), and the CH(CH3) from C3. So that's two methyls, one COOH, and CH(CH3). So that's four substituents? No, wait, COOH is on C1, which is connected to C2. So C2's substituents are: the COOH (C1), the two methyl groups, and the C3 (which is CH(CH3)). So for C2, the groups are:

- COOH (from C1)
- two CH3 groups
- C3 (which is CH(CH3))

Wait, so that's three substituents: COOH, CH3, CH(CH3). No, wait, each carbon has four bonds. So, C2 is connected to:

- One COOH (on C1: the carbon before is C1-OOC)
- Two CH3 groups
- One CH(CH3) (C3)
- And perhaps another hydrogen? Wait, no, because it's CH(CH3), meaning it's a CH2 group with a methyl. Wait, no, in this case, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons has a methyl. So each is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- two methyl groups (since it's CH(CH3), which is connected to two CH3 groups and two adjacent carbons)
Wait, no. Wait, CH(CH3) is connected to one methyl group and two other carbons, perhaps. Wait, no, maybe each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), so each has one methyl, and two other CH(CH3) groups. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has one methyl group, and the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons. But in any case, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in this case, let's look at C2. It has:

- two methyl groups (same)
- a COOH group from C1
- a connection to C3 (which is CH(CH3))

So, substituents are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3. So that's three different groups, but wait, two are CH3, so it can't be a chiral center. Because two substituents are the same. So C2 has two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has the same situation. So both C2 and C3 are not chiral. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. But wait, wait, the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. If the substituents on C2 and C3 are arranged in a way that makes each a chiral center, then it would have optical activity.

Wait, wait, each of C2 and C3 would have four substituents. Let's see: C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), two CH3 groups, and C3. So:

Substituents of C2: COOH, CH3, CH3, and CH(CH3) (from C3). So two substituents are CH3, so not four different. So C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly for C3. So the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active. But wait, the question says (2R,3S), so perhaps they are chiral centers. Did I make a mistake in my analysis? Because if each of C2 and C3 has four different substituents, then they would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in the structure. Let me reevaluate. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons has:

- One methyl group (since it's CH(CH3)), so that's one substituent.
- Two CH(CH3) groups from adjacent carbons? No. Wait, each carbon is connected to:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has three substituents: one methyl, and two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3). So for C2, the substituents are:

- C1: which is (HOOC-CH2-) or perhaps COOH is on C1, which is a CH(CH3). Wait, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents: two methyl groups, a COOH, and another carbon. No, that can't be because each middle carbon is a CH(CH3), which is a CH2 with a methyl. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In that case, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- One methyl group
- Two CH(CH3) groups (from adjacent carbons)
- And a carboxylic acid group (from C1 and C4)

Wait, but each middle carbon is connected to:

C2: connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups.

Wait, that would mean substituents: COOH (on C1), two methyl groups, and the CH(CH3) on C3. So four substituents? No, each carbon has four bonds. So C2 has:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two methyl groups.

That's four groups: COOH, CH(CH3), methyl, methyl. So two are the same. So C2 is not a chiral center. Same for C3. Therefore, the molecule lacks chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the configuration is given, which suggests that each of C2 and C3 is a chiral center. But according to my analysis, that's not possible because they have two identical substituents (two methyl groups). So perhaps I'm missing something in the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each of C2 and C3 has four different groups. Let me think again. If each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups, a COOH group, and the adjacent CH(CH3), then no, they're not chiral. But if the structure is different, perhaps the substituents are different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe the substituents on C2 and C3 are not methyl but something else. No, the compound is 2,3-dimethyl, so they're methyl groups. Hmm. So I think this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

But wait, the question gives it as (2R,3S), which implies each is a chiral center. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let's try to imagine the structure. The molecule is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So each has:

- One methyl group
- One connection to the COOH group on C1
- One connection to the adjacent carbon (C3 or C2)
- And another group. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has three substituents: methyl, C1, and C3. But that's only three groups. So perhaps each of the middle carbons has a hydrogen as well. So, the substituents would be:

C2: methyl, COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different substituents: methyl, COOH, CH(CH3), and H. So that would make C2 a chiral center. Oh! I think I see now. Because each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), which implies that in addition to the methyl and the two adjacent carbons, there's a hydrogen attached. So each of the CH(CH3) groups has a hydrogen. So the substituents on C2 would be:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- methyl
- hydrogen.

So four different substituents. That makes C2 a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would have:

- COOH (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- methyl
- hydrogen.

So, C3 is also a chiral center. Thus, the molecule has two chiral centers, and the configurations are R and S respectively. So this compound is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Hmm, okay, so I was wrong earlier. So third compound has two chiral centers, so it is optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same structure as the third compound but with (2R,3R) configuration. So, does it have optical activity? Well, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Wait, in this case, if it's (2R,3R), would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's think. For example, if the configurations are both R, but the molecule is symmetrical. Let me visualize the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with each middle carbon being CH(CH3) with a hydrogen. So, if both C2 and C3 are R configurations, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule. If both chiral centers are R, then flipping the molecule over might not change anything because of the symmetry. Wait, but the configuration is (2R,3R), so perhaps the molecule is not chiral. Wait, no, because each chiral center has four different substituents. So the molecule would still be chiral even with (2R,3R) configuration. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then maybe it's not chiral. Let me think: the molecule is symmetrical around the C2-C3 axis. So if C2 and C3 have the same configuration, say both R, then the molecule might be achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, that depends on the mirror image. Wait, if you have both R configurations, the molecule could be superimposable on its mirror image if there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the molecule is meso. Because if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, in the case of (2R,3R), if the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound and thus not optically active.

Wait, let me think again. In the third compound, (2R,3S), the configurations are different. So the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. But in the fourth compound, (2R,3R), the configurations are same, but perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So would that make it a meso compound?

Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If both C2 and C3 are R, does that create a plane of symmetry? Let's consider the mirror plane that goes through the middle of the molecule. If the configurations are (R,R), then the mirror image would have (S,S), but the actual molecule is (R,R), so it wouldn't be superimposable. Wait, no, because the mirror image would flip the configuration. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the mirror image would be the same as the original. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps (2R,3R) would lead to a meso compound because the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. 

Wait, so for a molecule to be meso, it must have multiple chiral centers but also a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the (2R,3R) configuration leads to a plane of symmetry, the molecule is meso and thus not chiral. So the fourth compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but how? Let me think of tartaric acid as an example. The meso form of tartaric acid is (2R,3R), which is achiral. So similarly, if this molecule is a meso form, then it's not optically active. So in the fourth compound, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound, so no optical activity.

So third compound has (2R,3S), which is chiral, so optical activity. Fourth is (2R,3R), which is meso, so no optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So cyclohexene with an alcohol group on C1 and a double bond at C3. The configuration is R. So, does this molecule have a chiral center? The cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a hydroxyl group on C1. So the structure is cyclohexene with OH on C1. The configuration is R, which implies that C1 is a chiral center. Because the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH group
- The cyclohexene ring (with double bond)
- Two CH2 groups (maybe)

Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. Then, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH group
- The ring (which includes C2, C6, and the double bond at C3)
- CH2 groups from the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

At C1: OH, ring (with substituents), and two other CH2 groups. So if the ring structure makes the substituents different, then C1 is a chiral center. So in (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is at C3. So the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. But I'm not sure if that's enough to make it a chiral center.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. C1 has:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6)
- And the ring structure, which includes the double bond at C3.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

1. OH
2. CH2- (to C2)
3. CH2- (to C6)
4. The rest of the ring (which includes the double bond at C3, so it's a cyclohexene ring).

Wait, but in reality, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to adjacent carbons)
- And the ring's structure, which includes the double bond.

But for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

1. OH
2. CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 (but that's not accurate; it's a ring)
Wait, perhaps each substituent is a unique group. Let me think of it as:

C1 is connected to:

- OH
- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C6)
- And the ring structure, which is part of the cyclohexene. 

Wait, but the ring itself is a cyclohexene, so the groups attached to C1 are the same on both sides of the ring. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (which are identical)
- The cyclohexene ring.

Wait, that would mean that two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups leading to C2 and C6), so C1 would not be a chiral center. But wait, that can't be right because in the molecule, C1 has the OH group and is connected to two carbons in the ring. Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2-CH2- (from C2)
- CH2-CH2- (from C6)
- And the double bond at C3.

No, perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different. Because the ring is connected in a way that each adjacent group is unique. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two -CH2- groups that are part of the ring (but perhaps not identical)
- And a bridge or something else.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's C1 is a chiral center. If the configuration is R, then it must have four different groups. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two different CH2 groups (like being on different sides of the double bond)
- And another group from the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are all different, making C1 a chiral center. So, the compound (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center at C1, making it optically active.

But wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the double bond is at C3, then the substituents on either side of the ring could make the molecule symmetrical. So, perhaps C1 isn't a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring has a chair conformation, and the substituents are arranged in a way that makes C1 a chiral center. So, I think I'm leaning towards this compound being chiral because it has an R configuration, implying a chiral center. So, this compound would have optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So cyclohexane with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. So, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. Each of these hydroxyl-bearing carbons: are they chiral centers? Let's look at C1. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6)
- And another group from the ring.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two others. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6)
- And a CH group (to C6 and C2? Not sure).

Wait, perhaps each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5) has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Let me think: For C1, substituents would be:

1. OH
2. CH2 (to C2)
3. CH2 (to C6)
4. The rest of the ring, which includes C5 and other groups.

Wait, but in reality, the substituents could be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (to adjacent carbons)
- And the ring's structure, which includes the other hydroxyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are all different. Because C1 is connected to two different CH2 groups (C2 and C6), an OH, and the ring. So, perhaps each of these (C1, C3, C5) are chiral centers. So this molecule has three chiral centers. But whether it's optically active depends on whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, but with all three substituents (OH) on the same side (all s), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, in a chair conformation, if the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the configurations create a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be achiral despite having chiral centers.

Wait, for example, consider a cyclohexane with three substituents, each in s configuration. If the substituents are placed in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, it could be a meso compound. So, perhaps this molecule is not chiral, making it not optically active.

Alternatively, maybe it's chiral. Let me think: (1s,3s,5s) might lead to a non-symmetrical arrangement. Because if all are s, then each substituent is in a specific orientation.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll make a guess. Let's imagine the molecule is such that the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically. For example, if they are all axial and placed at 120 degrees apart, the molecule might have a three-fold axis of symmetry, making it not chiral. Alternatively, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, no, because a three-fold axis would mean the molecule is symmetrical, hence achiral. So, if the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry, it's not chiral. But, in reality, I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps each of the OH groups is on a different position, and the molecule isn't symmetrical, making it chiral.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make a decision here. Maybe this molecule is chiral because it has three chiral centers without any plane of symmetry. So it would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it wouldn't. So, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration leads to symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical across a plane, making it a meso compound. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of a specific example. For instance, in a cyclohexane with substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if each substituent is the same, then it's a meso compound. So, if the substituents are all the same (like OH), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a meso compound and thus not optically active.

Wait, but wait, the configurations are all s. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are all on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they're all on the same side, the mirror image would be the same, making it achiral.

Thus, I think this molecule is not chiral, so no optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure-wise, it's a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at C1). So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). Hmm. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- Cyclopentyl group
- Ketone (C=O)
- Two CH2 groups (from the chain)

Wait, but in butan-1-one, the ketone is on C1. So, C1 is the carbonyl carbon. So, substituents on C1 would be:

- Cyclopentyl group
- O=C-
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C3?)

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3C=O. So, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. So, the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's pentan-1-one with a cyclopentyl substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The formula is C5H9 (cyclopentyl) attached to C1 of butan-1-one, which is (CH2)3-C=O.

So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be pentan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-2. I'm not sure, but the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking for a chiral center, let's see. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. Then, other carbons in the chain: C2, C3, etc. Let's see.

The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the structure would be:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-2.

Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So, substituting the C1 with cyclopentyl and C3 with methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Hmm, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)).

Wait, no, but the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, substituting C1 with cyclopentyl and C3 with methyl would give:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH3)(cyclopentyl)-CH3?

No, I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it differently. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one has four carbons with the ketone on C1. So:

C1: carbonyl carbon (O=C-)
C2: CH2
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: CH3

So, if C1 is substituted with a cyclopentyl group, the structure becomes O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Wait, but that would be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon can't be a chiral center. C2 is CH2, so not chiral. C3 is CH(CH3), so substituents:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH3 (from CH(CH3))
- CH3 (from C4)
- And the cyclopentyl group?

Wait, no, C3 has substituents:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH3 (from the methyl group)
- CH3 (from C4)
- And cyclopentyl? No, C3 is connected to C2, C4, and a methyl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, C3 is connected to C2, C4, and a methyl. So substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, but that would make four substituents, but it's a CH(CH3) group. So substituents:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And what else? Maybe a hydrogen? No, because it's CH(CH3), which implies:

Structure at C3: CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3
- And a hydrogen.

So, substituents on C3 are CH2, CH2, CH3, H. Two are CH2, so C3 is not a chiral center. So, no chiral centers in this molecule, so no optical activity.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are different. For example, if the cyclopentyl group is attached in a way that makes C2 or C3 a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached to C2, making it a chiral center. Hmm, but that's not what the question says. The question states it's 1-cyclopentyl, so it's attached to C1.

So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Now, let's count how many compounds are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-...: Yes.
4. (2R,3R)-...: No.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No.

So, compounds 2,3,5 are optically active. That's three compounds. Wait, but the options start from 2,3,5 as three. But wait, let me check my earlier analysis again.

Wait, earlier I thought:

- Compound 1: No.
- Compound 2: Yes.
- Compound 3: Yes.
- Compound 4: No.
- Compound 5: Yes.
- Compound 6: No.
- Compound 7: No.

So that's three compounds (2,3,5) that are optically active.

But wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought compound 5, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, has a chiral center. So that's three. But looking back, perhaps compound 6 is achiral because of symmetry. So, the total is three.

Wait, but let me check again for each compound.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. Yes.

4. No.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

So, three compounds (2,3,5) are optically active.

Wait, but let me check the first compound again. Did I make a mistake earlier?

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Structure: Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but in this structure, both C1 and C2 are connected to the double bond. So, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because it's planar around the double bond. But wait, could there be a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the CH2 group is attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)). The rest is CH2 and CH3. Are any of the carbons chiral?

C1: Cl, CH2, double bonds to C2 (so two substituents). So C1 has:

- Cl
- CH2
- Double bond to C2 (so substituents would be C2's groups)

Wait, perhaps C2 has substituents that could make it a chiral center. C2 has:

- CH(CH3)
- Double bond to C1 and C3.

So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (from CH(CH3))
- Double bond to C1
- Double bond to C3
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center at C2. Let me think: C2 is connected to:

- CH3 (from CH(CH3))
- Double bond to C1 (Cl-CH2-)
- Double bond to C3 (CH2-CH3)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms. So, for C2, it's bonded to C1 (Cl-CH2-), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and a double bond to C3 (CH2CH3). So, substituents would be Cl-CH2-, CH3, and double bonds. Hmm, perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center because it's part of a double bond, making it planar. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical activity.

So, to sum up:

Optically active compounds: 2,3,5 → three.

So, the answer is option B) 3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. Optical activity arises when a compound has chirality, which can occur due to the presence of a chiral center, a plane of asymmetry, or another form of chirality. Here's the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
The structure is **Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2**. The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, and no carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Specifically, C1 has substituents Cl, CH2, and two bonds to C2 (part of the double bond), while C2 has substituents CH3, CH2, and two bonds to C1. Since no chiral center exists, the molecule is not optically active.

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
This is a bicyclic compound with a complex structure. The substituents and stereochemistry suggest that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical activity.

---

### 3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
The structure is **HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents: a carboxylic acid group, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon. This makes both C2 and C3 chiral centers. Since the configurations are (2R,3S), the molecule is chiral and optically active.

---

### 4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
The structure is the same as in compound 3, but with configurations (2R,3R). In this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

---

### 5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
The structure is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1 and a double bond at C3. The configuration is (R), which implies that C1 is a chiral center. C1 has four different substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. Since it is a chiral center, the molecule is optically active.

---

### 6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
The structure is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups (-OH) on C1, C3, and C5, all in the (s) configuration. While the molecule has three chiral centers, the (1s,3s,5s) configuration introduces a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is not optically active.

---

### 7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is **O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3**. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. C2 and C3 are CH2 and CH(CH3) groups, respectively, and neither has four different substituents. Thus, the molecule lacks chirality and is not optically active.

---

### Conclusion
Compounds 2, 3, and 5 are optically active due to chirality. Compounds 1, 4, 6, and 7 are not optically active. 

**Total optically active compounds: 3**

**Answer: B**
