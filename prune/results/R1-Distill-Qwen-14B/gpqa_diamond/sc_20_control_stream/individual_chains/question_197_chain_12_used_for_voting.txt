Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the product is by looking at the given IR and NMR data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I should probably analyze the spectral data provided. Let's start with the IR. The IR data is given as peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹.

IR peaks can tell me about functional groups. The broad peak between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H or N-H stretching. Since there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid? Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches that are usually broader, like around 2500-3300. So if the main peak is 3400–2500, it might be a carboxylic acid with a broad O-H. But wait, sometimes in IR, a peak in that range can also indicate an alcohol or maybe an amine. Hmm.

Then, the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. Those are probably from a benzene ring with substituents—maybe para-substituted because of the symmetry.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H NMR shows the following signals.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons are usually around 7-8 ppm, but this is higher. A broad peak could be an O-H, like from a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, it might be a phenolic O-H, but those are usually broader and around 5-10 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This would be aromatic protons, probably from a para-substituted benzene. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So if it's para, each H has two adjacent Hs, but wait, para substitution usually leads to two doublets each with 2H. Wait, but for a para-substituted ring like p-xylene, the two sets of Hs would be two doublets each with 2H. Alternatively, if there's a substituent that's deactivating, it could cause the Hs to be more deshielded.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, probably the other set in a para-substituted benzene. So this makes me think the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. Or maybe one substituent causing the ring to have two sets of doublets. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para position, like a ketone and something else?

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carbonyl group. Let me think. If the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps a carbonyl group attached. So maybe it's a benzoic acid or a phenyl ketone.

But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is about 1700 cm⁻¹, and the O-H is broad. So the 1720 is a bit higher, which might be more typical of an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an acid with some electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, another possibility: if it's an acid chloride, the carbonyl is higher, around 1800 cm⁻¹, so that's probably not it. So perhaps if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720. Or maybe a ketone. But let's look at the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. If that's a carbonyl group, maybe it's a carbonyl next to an electronegative group or something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's an aldehyde. But wait, aldehydes typically have a sharp singlet around 9-10 ppm. A broad peak might not fit, but sometimes that could be an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is reacting, but that's not here.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Or wait, maybe it's the reduction of a carbonyl group. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, and the reagent is P with HCl or HI? Alternatively, maybe it's another reaction. Oh wait, red phosphorus with HI is used for the reduction of carbonyl groups as well. So perhaps the starting material X has a carbonyl group that's being reduced.

Wait, so the reaction is X + red phosphorus and HI. I think that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but sometimes other conditions are used. Wait, wait, maybe it's the Wurtz reaction? No, Wurtz is for alkyl halides. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used for the reduction of esters or amides to alkanes? Or wait, the Staudinger reaction? No, that's for azides. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Clemmensen: reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg) and HCl. Another method for ketone reduction is using LiAlH4, but that's a stronger reducing agent. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones. I think that's correct. So if compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to an alkane.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl. So X has a carbonyl group. So the reaction would reduce that.

So after the reaction, the carbonyl (like a ketone) would become a CH2 group. Or if it's an aldehyde, it becomes a CH3 group.

Looking at the NMR data, let me see what the structure of X is.

The NMR has several signals:

1. 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, ketones don't have protons. So that can't be a ketone. Maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because the O-H of a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is a sharp peak, so that doesn't fit the broad singlet.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720, which for a carboxylic acid would be around 1700, but maybe the exact value could vary. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Let's proceed. So the 10.5 ppm peak is a carboxylic acid's O-H. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals are aromatic protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene. How many substituents are there on the ring?

Suppose the benzene is para-substituted with a group that has a carbonyl. For example, a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group. Then X would be something like benzoic acid with an ethyl group or something?

Wait, but looking at the other NMR signals. There's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That sounds like a CH group adjacent to another CH2. Maybe it's part of an isopropyl group or a secondary alcohol, but considering the reaction, perhaps it's a CH in a longer chain.

Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons as a multiplet. Maybe adjacent to another CH group, like part of a CH2CH structure.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a triplet of 3H as a doublet. That's probably a CH(CH3) group, like an isopropyl or a secondary carbon attached to a CH3.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet integrating to 3H, which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents. One substituent is the carboxylic acid (from the 10.5 ppm peak). Another substituent is a longer chain, perhaps a butyl group or something similar.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm doublet is 3H, which could be a CH3 attached to a CH that is next to another CH2. Let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something. Wait, let me see: if the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), that suggests a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is a longer chain, something like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the integration:

The 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): O-H of a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (2H, d): aromatic protons.
- 7.2 ppm (2H, d): aromatic protons.
- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): perhaps a CH group attached to another CH2.
- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): perhaps CH2 next to a CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): a CH2CH3.

Putting this together, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Wait, but let's see: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be the CH in the middle of a chain. For example, if it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So the options are either benzoic acids with substituents or substituted benzene rings.

If the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl, then the product would have the carbonyl group replaced by a CH2 group. So for example, if X is a benzophenone, the product would have CH2.

Wait, but in the given problem, X is the starting material, and it reacts to form the product. So the product is the option given, and I need to figure out which one is the product.

Let me think about each option.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. The substituent would be a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So if X has a carbonyl group, the product would have that group reduced. Let's see, for example, if X is a benzophenone (Ar-CO-Ar'), then the product would be Ar-CH2-Ar'.

But looking at the NMR data for X, let's try to figure out its structure.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad signal, which suggests an O-H. So X might be a benzoic acid. The IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid, but maybe it's conjugated or the substituents are electron-withdrawing.

The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets suggest a para-disubstituted benzene. So X is a benzoic acid with another substituent in the para position.

Wait, but benzoic acid has a COOH group, which is meta directing. Wait, but for substitution patterns, if it's para-substituted, perhaps the substituent is on the ring opposite the COOH. So, the benzoic acid has another substituent on the para position.

What would that substituent be? Looking at the NMR, the non-aromatic protons are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. So, it's probably an alkyl chain attached to the ring. Let's see:

At 0.9 ppm, a triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a methylene. So maybe a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a group like CH(CH3)CH2CH3—so a sec-butyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, then the structure would be p-sec-butylbenzoic acid. That would match option C.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is a reducing agent, the carbonyl group (the COOH) would be reduced. Wait, wait. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is adjacent to an -OH group. So during reduction, perhaps the carbonyl is reduced to a CH2 group. So, for benzoic acid, reduction would give toluene. But wait, it depends on the conditions.

Wait, but Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl. Can red phosphorus and HI reduce a carboxylic acid?

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X isn't a carboxylic acid but a ketone. Let me think again.

If X is a ketone, then the IR at 1720 would fit, and the 10.5 ppm would be a different proton.

Wait, but if X is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak might be from an alpha proton, but that doesn't make sense because alpha protons are usually around 2 ppm or so. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but I thought they are sharp.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups around 1720 cm⁻¹. The O-H in esters would be from the -COO- group, but that's usually broad and in a different region. But wait, esters don't have O-H unless it's an acidic proton, which is rare. More likely, the ester has a carbonyl and other substituents.

Alternatively, maybe X is a phenyl ester, like benzyl acetate or something. But the NMR data may not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the reaction again. If X has a carbonyl group, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is a reducing agent, then the carbonyl would be reduced to a CH2 group.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction would reduce the COOH group. Benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) would reduce to toluene (C6H5CH3). But wait, that would change the structure entirely. So the product would be something like (4-sec-butylphenyl)CH3, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a xylene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative. Let's say X is 4-phenylacetophenone, but that may not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think again about the NMR.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are two doublets, each integrating 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are in para positions.

If X is a para-disubstituted benzene with a carbonyl group and another substituent, like a COOR group or a ketone. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which points more towards a carboxylic acid than an ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. That would give the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H) because of the substituents.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group. Reduction of a carboxylic acid? I'm not entirely sure about that. Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, ketones are reduced to alkanes. Carboxylic acids are generally not reduced under Clemmensen conditions. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe X isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me think again. If the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, and a broad peak in the NMR, perhaps X is an ester. For example, ethyl benzoate would have a carbonyl at around 1720. But then, in the NMR, the ester's O-H would be a different story. Wait, esters don't have O-H; the carbonyl is present. So the broad peak at 10.5 ppm might not fit an ester.

Another possibility is that the 10.5 ppm peak is from an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually sharp, so a broad peak doesn't fit. Unless it's a conjugated aldehyde or something else. Maybe X has a conjugated aldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone. But then the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't fit. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is from an -OH group, but not a carboxylic acid. Maybe a phenol? But phenols have O-H around 5-7 ppm, so 10.5 is too high. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm is from an amide? But amides have N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which isn't matching the IR given. The IR shows a peak from 3400-2500, which is broad. So maybe an alcohol's O-H. But then, the 1720 is a carbonyl. So perhaps X is a ketone with an alcoholic group. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options and the reaction. The reaction is X + red phosphorus and HI. So, the product is one of the options. Let's think about what each option's structure is and what reaction would form it.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product is a benzoic acid. But in that case, what was X?

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Suppose X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde group (CHO) to a CH2OH group. Wait, no, Clemmensen reduces aldehydes to CH2 groups. So benzaldehyde would become toluene.

Alternatively, X could be 4-(sec-butyl) benzophenone. Then, reduction would give 4-(sec-butyl) diphenylmethane. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl acetate. Then, the ester group would be reduced to a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the reduction of a carbonyl group in a side chain. Let's think about the structure of X.

Looking back at the NMR data, the non-aromatic signals are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. That suggests a chain like CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the integration is 1H, 2H, 3H, and 3H. Hmm.

Let me consider a possible structure for X. Suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group (from the 10.5 ppm and 1720 IR). Then, the other substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure if this reagent reduces carboxylic acids; perhaps not. So maybe X isn't a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a phenyl ester. For example, ethyl benzoate. Then, the reaction would reduce the ester to a CH2 group. But then the product would be ethyl benzyl ether or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl ketone. For example, acetophenone with a substituent. Then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2.

Wait, maybe X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. The structure would be a benzene ring with a COCH3 group and a sec-butyl group para to each other.

The IR would have a peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ (the ketone), and the 10.5 ppm would be from where? Oh wait, acetophenone doesn't have an O-H, so that NMR peak wouldn't fit. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm is from an aldehyde, but then the IR would have a peak around 2800 cm⁻¹ for aldehyde C-H stretch, which isn't present. So perhaps that's not it.

Another thought: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Could that be an ester group? An ester usually has a carbonyl around 1720. Then, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm would be an O-H from an alcohol or something else. But I don't see an obvious fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to reconstruct the structure of X based on the NMR.

The aromatic region (8.0 and 7.2 ppm) suggests a para-substituted benzene. So substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (if it's 1,4-disubstituted).

The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. So X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent.

The other substituent is a group that has the NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH2CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group or a butyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) points to a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe it's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the structure is:

Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a situation where the carbonyl group (the COOH) would be reduced. But wait, carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under Clemmensen conditions. So what else could happen?

Wait, maybe X is an ester. Suppose X is 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl acetate. Then, the ester's carbonyl would be reduced to a CH2 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl ethyl ether? No, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the reaction differently. Another possibility is that the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution or elimination. Alternatively, maybe the reagent is for a different kind of reaction.

Wait, red phosphorus with HI can also be used for the substitution of halogen atoms. For example, in the presence of a carbonyl group, perhaps the HI acts as a nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Staudinger reaction, but that's more about azides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Wurtz reaction, but that's for coupling two alkyl halides with metal.

Wait, another thought: if X has a benzal chloride group, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone to an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone, and the reaction reduces the ketone to a CH2 group. Then, the product would be diphenylmethane. But none of the options seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction reduces it to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but a substitution. If X has a leaving group, perhaps the HI would substitute it.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would mean X is that, and the reaction would produce it. But the reaction is X reacting to form the product. So the options are the products, not X.

Wait, the question states that X is the starting material. So the product is one of the options, and X is the starting material.

So, if X has a carbonyl group, and the product is an alkane, perhaps X is a ketone, and the product is the corresponding alcohol or alkane.

Wait, but the options don't have alkanes. Let me look:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a benzoic acid derivative.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Again, a benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Another toluene derivative.

Wait a second, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an elimination. Or maybe it's a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a benzophenone to a dimethyl group or something.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's say X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, reduction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol.

But looking at the options, none of them show an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction yields a CH3 group. Wait, no, that would be more in the case of a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to CH2 groups and aldehydes to CH3 groups.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (i.e., 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group as a methyl group attached). So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's option D.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the product would be option D.

But wait, let me check the NMR of X to see if that structure fits.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets (2H each), as in the data.
- An aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm, which would be a singlet. But in the data, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. That's a bit higher than typical for an aldehyde. Also, aldehyde protons are usually sharp, not broad. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone. Suppose X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Then, the aldehyde (if any) isn't present, but the ketone is. The NMR would show a peak around 2.6 ppm for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl group. But in the given NMR, the non-aromatic peaks are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X has a carbonyl group that's part of a longer chain. For example, a propionic acid ester or something.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of a chain.

So putting that together, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, that would make it a pentyl group. Or perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branch. For example, it's a sec-butyl group: CH2CH(CH2CH3).

So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring.

So the structure of X is a benzene ring with a COOH group (from the 10.5 ppm and IR) and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the para position.

So X is 4-(propyl)benzoic acid? Wait, no, the substituent is longer.

Wait, no, the substituent is a propyl group? Let me count the carbons. The 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH2CH3, so that's two carbons. The 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Let me recount. If the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, that's two carbons from the benzene, then a CH2, then a CH attached to a CH2CH3.

Alternatively, it's a butyl group with a branch. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but the NMR doesn't fit that.

Wait, the substituent chain:

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH2CH3.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 between CH and CH2.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH adjacent to CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group arranged as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So it would be a benzyl-pentyl group.

Wait, but I'm not getting a clear picture. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Its structure is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions.

So, if the reaction reduces a carbonyl group, for example, turning a ketone into a CH2 group, then the product would have a CH2 instead of a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about how the IR and NMR data of X would look if X is option C, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that case:

- IR would have a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ (carboxylic acid carbonyl). But the given IR is at 1720, which is a bit higher, so perhaps that's not a perfect fit.

- The NMR would have a broad peak around 10 ppm for the -COOH O-H.

The rest of the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each 2H) and the substituent (sec-butyl group) as:

- The CH(CH3) would have a peak around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and the adjacent CH2 groups would have peaks around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

That seems to match the given NMR data.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group.

But wait, carboxylic acids are generally not reduced by Clemmensen conditions, which are for ketones and aldehydes. So perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but another carbonyl compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different type. Wait, maybe the reaction is not a reduction but something else, like a substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the carbonyl group is an ester. For example, ethyl benzoate would have a carbonyl around 1720. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI might reduce the ester to a CH2 group.

If X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then the ester group would be reduced to a CH2 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl ethyl ether or something else. But that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene), which is option D.

Let me check the NMR for X in that case.

X would be 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone.

NMR:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (2H each), as seen.

- The ketone's CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet (3H). But in the given data, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which doesn't fit a CH3.

So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about the reaction and the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

If the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2, then the product would have CH2 where the carbonyl was.

So, if X is a ketone, the product would be a CH2 group.

Looking at the options:

Option D has a benzene ring with a sec-butyl and a methyl group. So if the starting material had a ketone group, perhaps at the position where the methyl is now.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative. For example, 4-(sec-butyl)phenylacetophenone. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, which would reduce to a CH3 group.

Wait, let's say X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. The reduction would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (option D). Let me see if that makes sense.

The given NMR for X would then have:

- Aromatic protons as described.

- An aldehyde proton at around 9-10 ppm, but a sharp singlet. The given NMR has a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which doesn't fit an aldehyde. So maybe not.

So perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction isn't a reduction but a substitution. If X has a leaving group, like a bromide, then the HI could substitute it. But without knowing X's structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of an alkene, but I don't see any alkene signals in the IR.

Wait, the IR has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So, no, no alkenes present in X.

Putting this all together, I'm a bit stuck. But based on the NMR and IR data, X seems to be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction would then be with red phosphorus and HI, but I'm not certain how that would affect the structure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about X's structure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction leads to the formation of the acid from another group. For example, if X has a carbonyl group that becomes a COOH group after reaction, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an iodide, but that doesn't seem to match the options.

Another angle: looking for the correct option based on the reaction.

If the reaction is a reduction of a ketone (say, at position 1) to a CH2 group, and the substituent is at position 4, then the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, if the starting material has a carbonyl group at position 1 (as part of a ketone), and a substituent at position 4 (like a sec-butyl), then after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So the product would have CH2 at position 1 and the substituent at 4.

But none of the options have a CH2 group. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, the product would have a CH3 group in place of the aldehyde.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

But the NMR for X doesn't perfectly fit this structure because the aldehyde proton should be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but in the given data, the peak is a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm.

But given the options, and the reaction, option D seems plausible.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But wait, the reaction is X reacting to form the product. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what product is formed? If the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group, perhaps it's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. So, X must have a carbonyl group.

The product is one of the options, which includes benzoic acids and substituted benzenes.

So perhaps X is a ketone, and the product is the corresponding alcohol or alkane.

Wait, but the options don't have alcohols. So perhaps X is an aldehyde, which reduces to a CH3 group.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

In that case, the NMR of X would have a peak at around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde. The given data has 10.5 ppm (broad), which doesn't fit an aldehyde. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl alcohol or something else, but I can't think of anything.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But wait, the reaction would need to reduce the carbonyl group, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction reduces it to a CH2 group. For example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl acetate, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl CH2OH, but again, that's not an option.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but based on the NMR and the reaction, I think the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but that would mean X is something else. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think differently. The reaction is X → product. So the product is what's given in the options. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So X must have a functional group that reacts with this reagent.

Red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to CH2 or CH3, depending on whether it's a ketone or aldehyde.

So, if the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, then X must have a carbonyl group in the position where the methyl is now.

So X would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzaldehyde or something similar.

Wait, but then the NMR of X would have an aldehyde peak, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative, and the product is the corresponding diphenylmethane.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Given the time I've spent and the options, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis of the IR and NMR data provided is critical to deducing the structure of X and the nature of the reaction.

### Key Observations from the Spectral Data:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A broad peak between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - A strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals suggest a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

### Analysis of Compound X:
- The IR and NMR data collectively indicate that X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH3)).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
- Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups. However, carboxylic acids are generally resistant to reduction under these conditions. Despite this, the reaction likely reduces the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group (-CH3), resulting in the formation of **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Evaluation of the Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the spectral data or the reaction conditions.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks the carboxylic acid group indicated by the IR and NMR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This is the structure of Compound X, not the product of the reaction.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This matches the expected product after reduction of the carboxylic acid group in X.

### Conclusion:
The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** as the final product.
