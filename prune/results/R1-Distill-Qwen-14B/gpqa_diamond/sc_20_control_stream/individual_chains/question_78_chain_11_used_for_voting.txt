Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember potentials are important in electromagnetism for calculating fields without dealing directly with the forces. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and I'm supposed to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, given that t is larger than the time tr when the field was generated. Oh right, tr is the time when the charge was at a position that affects the field at r now.

So the setup is that the charge was at a position that's a distance d away from r, and the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at that time tr is v.

I remember that when charges are moving, their potentials aren't just the static case anymore. The potentials depend on both the charge's position and velocity. But wait, how exactly?

Let me recall the expressions for the potentials. For a static charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things change because of the motion affecting the fields.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge—oh, right, it's similar to the static case but considering the retarded time. The retarded time is when the fields were actually generated, so the potential depends on where the charge was at that earlier time. So the distance involved would be the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. That's given as vector d, so the magnitude is d = |d|.

So the scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε₀ d) multiplied by some factor involving the velocity maybe? Or perhaps it's more about the relative motion.

Wait, no, the scalar potential due to a moving charge is actually given by the static potential but evaluated at the retarded position. So V = q/(4πε₀ d) * [some Lorentz factor or something else?]. Hmm, but wait, I think in the standard expression, especially when considering potentials in relativity, the scalar potential might have a term involving the velocity. Or maybe it's the vector potential that has the velocity term.

Wait, the options don't show a gamma factor, which makes me think maybe we're in the non-relativistic limit. So perhaps the expressions are simpler. Let me think again.

The scalar potential for a point charge in motion is given by the static potential divided by (1 - v·r/(c² d)), where d is the distance and v is the velocity. Wait, isn't that right? Because the motion affects the potential due to time delay and the relative motion. So the denominator becomes d times (1 - v·r/(c² d)) or something like that.

Wait, let me think about the general solution. The scalar potential from a moving charge can be written as V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1/(d)) / (1 + (v·r)/(c² d)) ) ].

Wait, maybe I should write it as V = (q)/(4πε₀ (d - (v t_r))), but that's in terms of the time delay. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the vector d. Oh, because d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, then d·v would be the dot product of d and the velocity vector.

Wait, the exact expression is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / (d - (v tr)) ) ] ? No, that's not quite right. Maybe it's in terms of the relative velocity and distance.

Wait, I think the denominator is (d c² - v·d c) or something like that. Let me get this straight. The general expression for V when the charge is moving is V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's V = [q (1 - v²/c²)]/(4πε₀ (d)) ), but that's for the static case in a different context.

Wait, another approach: When a charge is moving, the potentials can be found using the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential V and vector potential A are given by expressions involving the charge's position and velocity.

The scalar potential is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1 + (v²/c²)) / (d - (v t)) ) ] but this seems complicated. Alternatively, in terms of d and the velocity.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the scalar potential is V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), because the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects. Similarly, the vector potential A would be proportional to the velocity times the charge.

Looking at the options, option C says V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D has + instead of -, but I think the denominator should have a minus because it's d c minus (v·d). So maybe C is correct.

Wait, why would the denominator be d c - v·d? Let me think about the derivation. When you have a moving charge, the potential depends on the retarded time. The retarded time tr satisfies r = s(tr) + d, where s(tr) is the position at time tr. The fields at tr influence the point r at t=tr + (distance)/c. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, the expression for V is (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/(d - (v/c²) (t - tr) ) ] but that might not be the easiest way.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential from a moving charge is given by V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)). Because when you have d being the vector from the charge's position to r, then the denominator would involve the component of the velocity along d. So that's the scalar potential.

Then for the vector potential A, the expression is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - v·d)), but scaled by some factor. Wait, looking at the options, option C says A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). Hmm, but I thought A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - v ·d)).

Alternatively, maybe there's a factor of c somewhere because A has units of [velocity * something], but let me think about the units. The vector potential A has units of (velocity * magnetic field) because B is Tesla, which is kg/(s² A), and A is T·m, so (kg m/(s² A)) * m = kg m²/(s² A), which is the same as (velocity times something with units of B·m). Wait, perhaps I should think about the Maxwell's equations.

Wait, in Maxwell's equations, the potentials are related to the fields via B = ∇ × A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t, but that might not help directly here.

Alternatively, let's think about the standard expressions. The scalar potential for a point charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/(d - (v t_r)) ]

where t_r is the retarded time, given by t_r = (r - s(tr)) / c. But maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, another resource says that the scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v at time t is:

V(r, t) = (q c)/(4πε₀ (r · v) + (d² c² - (r · v)^2 )^(1/2) [r · v - (v² d²)/(r · v + ... ) ]

Hmm, this seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potentials in Coulomb gauge or Lorenz gauge.

Wait, in the Lorenz gauge, the potentials satisfy ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t =0. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic approximation where the motion is slow, so the potentials can be approximated without worrying about the full relativistic terms.

In that case, the scalar potential would still be approximately the static potential, V = q/(4πε₀ r), and the vector potential would be A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π r). But this would be the case when the charge is moving with velocity v, but the field is static.

Wait, but in reality, when considering retarded times, the potentials are affected by the motion of the charge. So in the non-relativistic limit, the leading terms would have the static potential and the first-order effect from the velocity.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) times V. Option C has V multiplied by c in the numerator and denominator involving d c - v·d.

Wait, let's see. The scalar potential when the charge is moving is (V0) (1 + (v·r)/(c² r)) ), where V0 is the static potential. But wait, that might be for a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is similar to the static case, but when considering the motion, the denominator has a term involving d c minus v·d. So for V, it would be (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

Then, for A, the vector potential, it's (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Looking at the options, option C matches this: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D has a plus sign in the denominator, which doesn't seem right because it's a distance minus the projection of velocity. So I think option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the units. For V, the standard Coulomb potential has units of volts (or J/C), which is [V] = [q]/(ε₀ [distance]).

In option C, V is [q c]/(ε₀ [distance term]). Let's see: [d c] is [m][m/s] = m²/s. [v·d] is [m/s][m] = m²/s. So the denominator is [m²/s]. So V has units [q]/(ε₀ * (m²/s)) ). But [ε₀] is F/m = C²/(N·m²). So [ε₀] = (C² s²)/(kg m³). So let's write:

[1/ε₀] has units (kg m³)/(C² s²).

[q] is C.

So [q c]/(ε₀ (d c - ... )) = [C (m/s)] / [ (kg m³)/(C² s²) ) * (m²/s) ) ].

Wait, no, wait, denominator in V is (d c - v·d) which is in m²/s. So:

V = [C * (m/s)] / [ (kg m^3 / (C² s²)) * (m²/s) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute the denominator's units: ε₀ (d c - v·d) has units (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * (m²/s) ) = (C² s² * m²/s ) / (kg m³) ) = (C² s m²) ) / (kg m³) ) = (C² s )/(kg m).

Then V has [q] / [denominator] = (C) / ( (C² s)/(kg m) ) ). So (kg m )/( C s ). Hmm, but volts are kg m²/(C s²). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps checking the units for option C:

V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)).

Denominator: [d c] is [m][m/s] = m²/s.

Similarly, [d·v] is [m][m/s] = m²/s.

So denominator is m²/s.

So V's units: [q] is C.

[c] is m/s.

So numerator: C * (m/s).

Denominator: ε₀ * (m²/s).

ε₀ has units F/m = C²/(N m²) ) = C² s²/(kg m³).

So denominator overall: (C² s²/(kg m³)) ) * (m²/s) ) = (C² s m²)/(kg m^3) )= (C² s)/(kg m).

So V becomes [C (m/s)] / [ (C² s)/(kg m) ) ].

Which is [ (C m/s) * kg m ) ] / (C² s )

Simplify:

( kg m² )/( C s² )

Which is the unit of electric potential (volts) since [V] = kg m²/(C s²). So that checks out.

Similarly, for A in option C:

A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

μ₀ has units H/m = kg m/(s² A²).

v has units m/s.

So numerator: μ₀ * q * c * v.

μ₀ is kg m/(s² A²).

q is C= A s.

c is m/s.

v is m/s.

So numerator units: (kg m/(s² A²)) * (A s) * (m/s) * (m/s) ) =

kg m * (s * m²) / (s² A² * s² A²) )? Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

μ₀: kg m/(s² A²)

q: A s

c: m/s

v: m/s

So μ₀ * q: (kg m/(s² A²)) * (A s) ) = kg m/(s A).

Multiply by c: (kg m/(s A )) * (m/s) ) = kg m²/(s² A).

Multiply by v: (kg m²/(s² A )) ) * (m/s) ) = kg m³/(s^3 A).

Denominator: (d c - d·v) is m²/s.

So A's unit is (kg m^3/(s^3 A )) ) / (m²/s) ) = (kg m^3/(s^3 A )) * (s)/(m²) ) = kg m/(s² A).

Which is the unit of vector potential (since A is Tesla·m, and Tesla is kg/(s² A), so kg m/(s² A)). So units are correct.

So the units for both V and A in option C are correct.

Therefore, I think option C is the correct one.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \), and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the charge's position at \( t_r \) by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials are influenced by the motion of the charge, and the expressions must account for relativistic effects and the retarded time.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a static charge, the scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance to the charge.
   - When the charge is moving, the scalar potential is modified due to the relative motion and the retarded time. The denominator includes a term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between the charge and the observation point, and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) accounts for the projection of the velocity along the vector \( \vec{d} \).
   - The correct expression for the scalar potential is:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and depends on the same denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - The correct expression for the vector potential is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The vector potential is proportional to \( \vec{v} \), not \( \vec{v}^2 \).
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. While the scalar potential is correct for a static charge, the vector potential does not have the \( \vec{v}/c^2 \) factor in this context.
   - **Option C:** Correct. Both the scalar and vector potentials match the derived expressions, including the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - **Option D:** Incorrect. The denominator has a \( + \) sign, which is not consistent with the relativistic correction for moving charges.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, as they account for the motion of the charge and the relativistic effects in the denominator.

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/(d - (v t_r)) ]

where t_r is the retarded time, given by t_r = (r - s(tr)) / c. But maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, another resource says that the scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v at time t is:

V(r, t) = (q c)/(4πε₀ (r · v) + (d² c² - (r · v)^2 )^(1/2) [r · v - (v² d²)/(r · v + ... ) ]

Hmm, this seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potentials in Coulomb gauge or Lorenz gauge.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) times V. Option C has V multiplied by c in the numerator and denominator involving d c - v·d.

Wait, let's see. The scalar potential when the charge is moving is (V0) (1 + (v·r)/(c² r)) ), where V0 is the static potential. But wait, that might be for a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is similar to the static case, but when considering the motion, the denominator has a term involving d c minus v·d. So for V, it would be (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

Then, for A, the vector potential, it's (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Looking at the options, option C matches this: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D has a plus sign in the denominator, which doesn't seem right because it's a distance minus the projection of velocity. So I think option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the units. For V, the standard Coulomb potential has units of volts (or J/C), which is [V] = [q]/(ε₀ [distance]).

In option C, V is [q c]/(ε₀ [distance term]). Let's see: [d c] is [m][m/s] = m²/s. [v·d] is [m/s][m] = m²/s. So the denominator is [m²/s]. So V has units [q]/(ε₀ * (m²/s)) ). But [ε₀] is F/m = C²/(N·m²). So [ε₀] = (C² s²)/(kg m³). So let's write:

[1/ε₀] has units (kg m³)/(C² s²).

[q] is C.

So [q c]/(ε₀ (d c - ... )) = [C (m/s)] / [ (kg m³)/(C² s²) ) * (m²/s) ) ].

Wait, no, wait, denominator in V is (d c - v·d) which is in m²/s. So:

V = [C * (m/s)] / [ (kg m^3 / (C² s²)) * (m²/s) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute the denominator's units: ε₀ (d c - v·d) has units (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * (m²/s) ) = (C² s² * m²/s ) / (kg m³) ) = (C² s m²) ) / (kg m³) ) = (C² s )/(kg m).

Then V has [q] / [denominator] = (C) / ( (C² s)/(kg m) ) ). So (kg m )/( C s ). Hmm, but volts are kg m²/(C s²). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps checking the units for option C:

V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)).

Denominator: [d c] is [m][m/s] = m²/s.

Similarly, [d·v] is [m][m/s] = m²/s.

So denominator is m²/s.

So V's units: [q] is C.

[c] is m/s.

So numerator: C * (m/s).

Denominator: ε₀ * (m²/s).

ε₀ has units F/m = C²/(N m²) ) = C² s²/(kg m³).

So denominator overall: (C² s²/(kg m³)) ) * (m²/s) ) = (C² s m²)/(kg m^3) )= (C² s)/(kg m).

So V becomes [C (m/s)] / [ (C² s)/(kg m) ) ].

Which is [ (C m/s) * kg m ) ] / (C² s )

Simplify:

( kg m² )/( C s² )

Which is the unit of electric potential (volts) since [V] = kg m²/(C s²). So that checks out.

Similarly, for A in option C:

A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

μ₀ has units H/m = kg m/(s² A²).

v has units m/s.

So numerator: μ₀ * q * c * v.

μ₀ is kg m/(s² A²).

q is C= A s.

c is m/s.

v is m/s.

So numerator units: (kg m/(s² A²)) * (A s) * (m/s) * (m/s) ) =

kg m * (s * m²) / (s² A² * s² A²) )? Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

μ₀: kg m/(s² A²)

q: A s

c: m/s

v: m/s

So μ₀ * q: (kg m/(s² A²)) * (A s) ) = kg m/(s A).

Multiply by c: (kg m/(s A )) * (m/s) ) = kg m²/(s² A).

Multiply by v: (kg m²/(s² A )) ) * (m/s) ) = kg m³/(s^3 A).

Denominator: (d c - d·v) is m²/s.

So A's unit is (kg m^3/(s^3 A )) ) / (m²/s) ) = (kg m^3/(s^3 A )) * (s)/(m²) ) = kg m/(s² A).

Which is the unit of vector potential (since A is Tesla·m, and Tesla is kg/(s² A), so kg m/(s² A)). So units are correct.

So the units for both V and A in option C are correct.

Therefore, I think option C is the correct one.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \), and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the charge's position at \( t_r \) by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials are influenced by the motion of the charge, and the expressions must account for relativistic effects and the retarded time.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a static charge, the scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance to the charge.
   - When the charge is moving, the scalar potential is modified due to the relative motion and the retarded time. The denominator includes a term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between the charge and the observation point, and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) accounts for the projection of the velocity along the vector \( \vec{d} \).
   - The correct expression for the scalar potential is:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and depends on the same denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - The correct expression for the vector potential is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The vector potential is proportional to \( \vec{v} \), not \( \vec{v}^2 \).
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. While the scalar potential is correct for a static charge, the vector potential does not have the \( \vec{v}/c^2 \) factor in this context.
   - **Option C:** Correct. Both the scalar and vector potentials match the derived expressions, including the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - **Option D:** Incorrect. The denominator has a \( + \) sign, which is not consistent with the relativistic correction for moving charges.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, as they account for the motion of the charge and the relativistic effects in the denominator.
