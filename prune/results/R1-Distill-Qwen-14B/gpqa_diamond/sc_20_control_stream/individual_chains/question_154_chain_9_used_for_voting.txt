Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. 

The chemist found a white solid, and we need to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, I remember that the molecular ion peak (M) usually corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. So maybe the molecular weight is 156. But wait, the peak at 158 is a fragment or perhaps a molecular ion with an addition or loss of some group. 

In mass spec, sometimes when you have a molecular ion with an isotopic peak, like maybe if the molecule has a chlorine atom. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so it has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecular ion is at 156, and Cl adds 35 or 37, the isotopic pattern might show peaks at 156 and 158. The 158 peak is 32% of the M peak. Let me think: if the molecule has one chlorine, the isotopic ratio should be about 3:1 (since Cl has two isotopes, 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37). So the M+2 peak (158) should be about 25% of the M peak. Here, the M+2 is 32%, which is a bit higher than expected, but close enough—maybe due to other factors or maybe I'm a bit off. So perhaps the molecular formula includes one Cl.

Next, the IR spectrum. Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. If it's broad, maybe it's an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an aldehyde's -CHO group, but I think that tends to be more around 2800-2720 cm^-1 as a sharp peak, maybe? Or maybe it's an -OH in an acid. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typically a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm^-1) or maybe an ester, but esters are a bit lower, like 1730-1760. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches broad around 2500-3300, and their carbonyl around 1700. Esters are higher, like 1740-1760. So if the carbonyl is at 1720, that fits more with a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde, which has a carbonyl around 1720 as well. So maybe it's either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 11.0 ppm, singlet, 1H. That's a very high chemical shift, which suggests an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Aldehydic protons are typically around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But 11 is more like a phenolic OH or a carboxylic acid OH. However, phenols' OH protons are usually broader and might appear around 5-8 ppm if they are exchanging. But wait, in the IR, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700, which fits with an O-H group. So the 11.0 could be the O-H of a carboxylic acid. But wait, sometimes in DMSO, the OH of a carboxylic acid can be upfield compared to CDCl3, but not sure. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, maybe it's another scenario. Wait, but the 11.0 is a singlet, which might be a carboxylic acid, because the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually sharp, but in DMSO it's a broad peak, but in CDCl3, maybe it's a singlet. Hmm, not entirely sure.

The other NMR peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are in the aromatic region. A doublet each, integrating to two protons each. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and couple with each other, leading to a doublet. So if you have two doublets, each integrating to two H, it's likely a para-substituted aromatic ring.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, 3. That might lead to more complex splitting in the NMR, perhaps a triplet or something else. Also, an aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the 11.0 suggests something else.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4, and a COOH group at position 1. So the aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be two doublets in para positions. For benzoic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 11.0 (s). The IR would show a broad peak for the O-H and a strong peak at ~1700 for the carboxylic acid.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl attached to a carbonyl (like OCl-CO-Ph). Wait, chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-Ph? Or perhaps Cl-CO-Ph-O-something? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, the structure would have a carbonyl connected to Cl and OPh. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as a para-substituted ring because the chloroformate is connected to the benzene in a para position? Wait, no, chloroformate is O-CO-Cl, connected to the benzene. So the benzene is attached to the oxygen, so the substituent is in the para position relative to the chloroformate group. But wait, the structure would be O=C(Cl)-O-Ph. So the benzene ring would be attached to the oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl and Cl.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be deshielded. For benzene rings with substituents, the coupling would depend on substitution. If the substituent is at the para position, the ring would have two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches the NMR data. The IR would show a strong C=O peak, but would it be a carbonyl from an ester or acid? Wait, chloroformate is an acyl chloride, so the carbonyl would be around 1800 cm^-1. But the IR data here has a peak at 1720, which is more like a carboxylic acid or ester. So perhaps this is not the right fit.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the ring substituents are at 1 and 2. The aromatic protons would then be ortho to substituents. The NMR would show more complex splitting because the protons are adjacent to substituents. So perhaps the doublets might not be as straightforward as in a para substitution. Also, the O-H would be around 11 ppm, which matches.

Wait, but let's think again. For benzoic acid derivatives, the aromatic protons are typically deshielded because of the electron-withdrawing COOH group. For example, para-substituted benzoic acids have two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two H, as the protons are in two sets of equivalent positions. But for 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the aromatic ring would have substituents in the ortho position relative to each other. The H's would be in a more complex pattern, perhaps as a triplet or something else.

Looking back at the NMR: two doublets, each 2H. That suggests the ring is para-substituted. So option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl) positions. So the ring would be para-substituted, meaning two sets of equivalent H, each in a doublet. So that fits the NMR.

So the molecular weight is 156. Let's check the molecular weights of the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2.

Carbon: 7 *12=84, H:5*1=5, Cl:35.5, O:2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight ~156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, which is a bit low. But perhaps it's the exact mass or maybe it's a typo, or it's the M+ peak. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2 or something else. Wait, let me recount.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl adds 35.5, so 7*12=84 +6=90 +32=122. Adding Cl makes it 122 +35.5 = 157.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2. Let me compute that: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total=84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular weight is approximately 156.5. So the molecular ion peak at 156 would correspond to the M peak, which is about 156.5, but in mass spec, the peaks are at integer masses. So the M peak is at 156 (the whole number approximation), and the M+2 would be at 158, which matches the 32% peak. So that makes sense.

Wait, but the M is at 156, which is 156.5 rounded down. So the M peak is 156, and M+2 is 158, which occurs when the molecule has a Cl atom. So that fits.

Looking at the IR again: strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725, so 1720 is right in the ballpark. The broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 is due to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. So that's consistent with option B.

The NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) would be the O-H of the COOH group. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, suggesting a para-substituted benzene. That fits with 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Now, let's look at the other options again.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is O=C(Cl)-O-Ph. The molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Wait, let's compute the molecular weight: 8*12=96, 7*1=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total=96+7=103 +35.5=138.5 +32=170.5. That's higher than the M peak of 156, so that can't be option C. So option C is out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as option B? No, wait, the positions are different. The molecular weight would be same as option B, 156.5. But in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the aromatic protons would not be in two doublets each of 2H. Instead, maybe you'd see more complex splitting. So the NMR would not match.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as options B and D, but the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows a peak at 11.0, which is higher, suggesting a carboxylic acid rather than an aldehyde. So option A is probably not right.

So putting it all together, the spectral data aligns with option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The molecular weight matches, the IR shows a carboxylic acid, the NMR shows a para-substituted ring with a COOH group, and the mass spec shows Cl isotopes.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Mass Spectrometry (MS)
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156** (100%), and a peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) is observed. The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 suggests the molecule contains a chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37). The isotopic pattern (32% for M+2) is consistent with a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The molecular weight is approximately **156.5**, which aligns with the molecular ion peak.

### Infrared (IR)
- A **broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
- A **peak at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** suggests an O-H proton, characteristic of a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the two sets of doublets integrate to 2H each.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Contains an aldehyde group (-CHO), which would produce a proton signal around 9–10 ppm in the NMR. However, the observed peak at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H proton. Additionally, the aromatic splitting pattern does not match the para-substitution observed in the NMR.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position.  
   - The molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of **156.5**, matching the molecular ion peak.  
   - The IR spectrum matches the carboxylic acid functional group, and the NMR shows a para-substituted aromatic ring, consistent with this structure.  
   **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph).  
   - The molecular formula is **C₈H₇ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of **170.5**, which is higher than the observed molecular ion peak (156).  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.  
   - The molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of **156.5**, matching the molecular ion peak. However, the aromatic splitting pattern does not match the para-substitution observed in the NMR.  
   **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion
The spectral data (MS, IR, and NMR) are consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight matches, the IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid, and the NMR shows a para-substituted aromatic ring.
