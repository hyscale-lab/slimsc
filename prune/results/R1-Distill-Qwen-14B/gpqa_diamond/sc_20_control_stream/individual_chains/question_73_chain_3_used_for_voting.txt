Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because you can't just use classical mechanics. So, for velocities, you can't just subtract them normally when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Wait, right, there's the velocity addition formula in special relativity.

So, the first part is finding the relative speed between the two astronauts. Let's see, astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. But wait, relative to what? Oh, I think the problem is asking for the relative speed of one with respect to the other. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, what's their relative speed?

Wait a second, in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just v1 - v2. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me make sure. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity u' when moving from one frame to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame and v is the velocity of the moving frame.

Wait, but in this case, we're looking for the relative speed between the two. So let me think: If both are moving in the same direction, then in the frame of astronaut A, astronaut B is moving at (vB - vA)/(1 - vA vB / c²). Wait, no, wait: I think the formula is (vB - vA) divided by (1 - (vB * vA)/(c²)). Because astronaut B is moving at vB, and the observer (astronaut A) is moving at vA. So the relative speed is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/c²).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Let's say the observer is in a frame moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame. So, in the lab frame, object 1 is moving at velocity v1, object 2 at v2. The relative velocity u' between them would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/c²). Wait, that's if the observer is moving at velocity u; perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the velocity of B as seen from A's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the velocity addition formula. Let me recall: If frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

In this problem, let's consider astronaut A as the observer. So, from A's frame, what is the velocity of astronaut B?

In the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's velocity?

Wait, maybe the lab frame is where both astronauts are moving. Let me clarify: The problem says they're both moving in the positive x-direction. So, in the lab frame, one is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c. So, in the lab frame, the relative speed between them would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but only if they are moving in the same direction. But wait, that's the classical approach, which is only valid when speeds are much lower than c. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, that's not correct. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, so from the lab frame, the relative speed between them would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is B's speed (0.5c) and v is A's speed (0.6c). Wait, no, wait: Oh no, wait, I'm getting this wrong. The formula is for when you have an object moving at speed u in the lab frame, and the observer is moving at speed v in the lab frame. Then, the object's speed in the observer's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. So, if we want to find the speed of astronaut B as seen from A's frame, we should apply the formula. So u (the object's speed in lab) is 0.5c, and v (the observer's speed in lab) is 0.6c.

So plugging into the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6 c²)/c² = 1 - (0.3) = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. Since speed is positive, we take the magnitude, so about 0.1428c. Which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed between them is 0.14c.

Wait, but wait: when you compute (u - v), if the result is negative, it means B is moving slower than A from A's frame. So, in A's frame, B is moving at (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.1428c, which is 0.1428c in the opposite direction. But the question is about the relative speed, which is just the magnitude, so 0.14c.

So that's the relative speed part. Now, looking at the options, let's see which ones match this. Let's look at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2.

Option B: 0.1c, E=4.96 mc^2.

Option A: 1.1c which is impossible because nothing can go faster than c, so we can eliminate that.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, so options C and D are possible.

Now, the next part is the total energy of the system.

Wait, the system comprises both astronauts, so their total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each has their own rest mass, so we calculate the energy for each and add them.

The total energy E_total is E1 + E2, where E1 = gamma1 * m1 * c², and E2 = gamma2 * m2 * c².

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's compute each energy.

For astronaut 1 (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, 2.5? Let me compute that again. 1.25 multiplied by 2 is 2.5, correct.

Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, let me compute the exact value. Because 1/sqrt(0.75) is exactly equal to 2/sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.1547.

So 3m * 1.1547 c² = 3 * (2/sqrt(3)) ) m c².

Wait, 2/sqrt(3) is about 1.1547.

So 3 * (2/sqrt(3)) ) = 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3) * (3/3) ) Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 2*1.732 = 3.464.

So E2 exactly is 3m * (2/sqrt(3)) c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c², which is approximately 3.464 m c².

So E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So that's matching both the relative speed and the energy.

Wait, but I should double-check the relative velocity calculation. Let me recompute it.

vA = 0.6c (Astronaut A's speed in lab frame)
vB = 0.5c (Astronaut B's speed in lab frame)

From A's frame, what's B's speed?

Using the formula: u' = (vB - vA) / (1 - (vA vB)/c² )

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ) 

Numerator: -0.1c
Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're considering relative speed, we take the magnitude, so 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Part 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \) in the same direction. To find the relative speed between them, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( v_A = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame),
- \( v_B = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

- Numerator: \( 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c \),
- Denominator: \( 1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

Thus:
\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but relative speed is the magnitude:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Part 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1 (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2 (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.

Wait, wait, 2.5? Let me compute that again. 1.25 multiplied by 2 is 2.5, correct.

Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, let me compute the exact value. Because 1/sqrt(0.75) is exactly equal to 2/sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.1547.

So 3m * 1.1547 c² = 3 * (2/sqrt(3)) ) m c².

Wait, 2/sqrt(3) is about 1.1547.

So 3 * (2/sqrt(3)) ) = 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3) * (3/3) ) Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 2*1.732 = 3.464.

So E2 exactly is 3m * (2/sqrt(3)) c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c², which is approximately 3.464 m c².

So E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So that's matching both the relative speed and the energy.

Wait, but I should double-check the relative velocity calculation. Let me recompute it.

vA = 0.6c (Astronaut A's speed in lab frame)
vB = 0.5c (Astronaut B's speed in lab frame)

From A's frame, what's B's speed?

Using the formula: u' = (vB - vA) / (1 - (vA vB)/c² )

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ) 

Numerator: -0.1c
Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're considering relative speed, we take the magnitude, so 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Part 1: Relative Speed

\]

Here:
- \( v_A = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame),
- \( v_B = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

- Numerator: \( 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c \),
- Denominator: \( 1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

Thus:
\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but relative speed is the magnitude:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Part 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}

#### Energy of Astronaut 1 (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2 (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.
