Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question involves finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, which is given as matrix P. The system's state at time t is a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). 

Wait, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. And the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's components, after projecting the state onto that eigenvector.

But wait, maybe I should first check if the matrix P is diagonal. If it is, then finding eigenvalues would be straightforward, because the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. Looking at P's matrix: the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, no, it's not diagonal because there are non-zero off-diagonal elements.

So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry that can simplify this. Let me think about the structure of P.

Looking at P, the first and third rows look similar. The first row is 0 at (1,1), 1/sqrt(2) at (1,2), 0 at (1,3). The second row has 1/sqrt(2) at (2,1), 0 at (2,2), and 1/sqrt(2) at (2,3). The third row is similar to the first but mirrored. So, maybe this matrix is symmetric, which it is, because P[i][j] = P[j][i].

So, it's a symmetric 3x3 matrix, which means it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's good because it aligns with quantum mechanics observables, which need real eigenvalues.

Let me write down matrix P again:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So, to find the eigenvalues, I need to calculate the determinant of (P - λI), where I is the identity matrix. So, the characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix (P - λI):

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, but since the last element in the first row is zero, it might be easier to expand along that row.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to expand the determinant in terms of the first row.

So, the determinant is:

-λ * [( -λ )( -λ ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [something irrelevant].

Hmm, let me compute each minor.

The first term: -λ times the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing first row and column. That submatrix is:
[ -λ    1/√2 ]
[1/√2   -λ  ]
So, determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

The second term: -(1/√2) times the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing first row and second column. That submatrix is:
[1/√2  1/√2 ]
[0     -λ   ]
Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) )= (-λ/√2).

Third term is zero, so we can ignore it.

Putting it all together, the determinant is:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ³ + (λ)(1/2)
Second term: - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ * 1/√2 * 1/√2 ) ) = λ*(1/2)
So, the determinant is (-λ³ + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) ) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So, the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0. Let's factor this:

λ (-λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0.

So, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

Wait, wait, let me check that. Because when I factor -λ³ + λ = 0:

Factor out λ: λ(-λ² +1) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0. So, λ =0, and 1-λ²=0 → λ²=1 → λ=1, -1.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So the possible outcomes for the observable P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 as the outcome.

Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates corresponding to the same eigenvalue are orthogonal. So, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 would be a normalized vector that satisfies (P - 0 I)|v> = 0 → P|v> = 0.

So, to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, but perhaps for this problem, I can proceed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the state vector given can be expressed as a sum of the eigenvectors of P, and the coefficients' squares would give the probabilities.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if the given state is normalized. Let me check the given state vector. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute the norm (dot product of the vector with itself).

So, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Therefore, the state vector is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) / sqrt(6).

Wait, but in the problem statement, is the state given as (-1,2,1) a column matrix, but not necessarily normalized? So, perhaps I should normalize it first before calculating probabilities.

Wait, but when calculating probabilities, the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes (the inner products), so perhaps I should normalize the state.

Wait, but maybe the observable P is a projection operator or something else. Let me think.

Wait, no, the problem says that P is an observable, so it's a Hermitian operator. So, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and compute the square of the inner product between the state vector and each of these eigenvectors.

Wait, but for eigenvalue 0, the eigenvectors would form a subspace. So, the state can be projected onto this subspace, and the probability would be the sum of squares of the projections onto each eigenvector in that subspace. But if the eigenvectors are orthonormal, then the probability is the square of the norm of the projection.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to solve for the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then find the projection of the state onto that eigenvector, and then square its magnitude.

So, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.

The equation is (P -0 I) |v> =0 → P |v> =0.

So, P is the matrix:

Row1: 0   1/√2  0
Row2: 1/√2 0   1/√2
Row3: 0   1/√2 0

We can write the system of equations for (x,y,z) as:

(0)x + (1/√2)y + 0 z = 0 → (1/√2) y =0 → y=0.

(1/√2)x + 0 y + (1/√2) z =0 → (1/√2)(x + z) =0 → x + z=0 → z= -x.

0 x + (1/√2) y + 0 z=0 → again y=0.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (x, 0, -x). So, any vector where y=0 and z= -x.

So, the eigenspace is two-dimensional, but wait, since the matrix is 3x3 and symmetric, the eigenvectors should be orthogonal. Wait, but for λ=0, the eigenspace is more than one-dimensional? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalue 0 has a two-dimensional eigenspace, because the rank of P is such that the null space is two-dimensional. Let me check.

Wait, the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0   1/√2  0
Row 2: 1/√2 0   1/√2
Row 3: 0   1/√2 0

If I write the equations:

y =0 (from first row).

x + z =0 (from second row).

y=0 again from third row.

So, the variables are x and z, with y=0 and z = -x.

So, the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x) = x(1, 0, -1). So, only one basis vector. Wait, but that's a one-dimensional eigenspace. But then the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces should equal 3. So, if λ=0 is a single eigenvalue with multiplicity 1, and the others are 1 and -1, which are distinct, then that makes sense.

Wait, but wait, the trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let me compute trace(P):

Trace is 0 + 0 +0 =0. But the sum of eigenvalues should be 0. So, 1 + (-1) + 0 =0, which matches.

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). So, any eigenvector can be written as a scalar multiple of this vector.

But wait, in the system of equations, x can be any value, with z = -x and y=0. So, the vectors are (x, 0, -x) = x*(1, 0, -1). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the null space, I thought it might be two-dimensional, but perhaps I was wrong. Because from the equations, x can vary, but z is determined by x, and y is fixed at 0. So, it's a line through the origin in the x-z plane, which is one-dimensional.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So, let's normalize this vector. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So, the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but perhaps I should write it as (1,0,-1) divided by sqrt(2).

Now, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1), but we need to normalize it first. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector corresponding to 0.

So, the inner product is [ (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ] · [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

Compute this:

= [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ) ] divided by sqrt(6)*sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = (-1) +0 + (-1) = -2.

So, the inner product is (-2) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(12) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)/sqrt(3) ]² = 1/3.

So, the probability is 1/3.

But wait, wait a second. Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and the state is projected onto it, the probability is the square of the projection, which is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So, the answer should be option C.

To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After simplifying, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors satisfy \( P|v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvectors are of the form \( (x, 0, -x) \), which can be normalized to:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the State Vector
The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\] Its norm is:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection onto the Eigenspace for \( \lambda = 0 \)
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( |v_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Computing the numerator:

\[
(1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
|\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
