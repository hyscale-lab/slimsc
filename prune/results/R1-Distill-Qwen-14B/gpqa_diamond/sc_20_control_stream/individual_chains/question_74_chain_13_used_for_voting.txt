Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think out loud here.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. That means the probability it hasn't decayed by 100 minutes is 68%, right? Because 100% minus 32% is 68%.

Now, the scenario here is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: Does that mean the next 150 minutes starting from the beginning, or the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed? Oh, the way it's phrased, "the next 150 minutes" probably refers to after the 50 minutes have elapsed. So the total time from now would be 150 minutes.

Wait, but the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So perhaps the decay follows an exponential model. Oh right, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decay in a certain time doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay.

Hmm, okay. So the initial setup is: the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes is 32%. So the decay constant λ can be found using the exponential decay formula.

The exponential decay formula for the probability of decay (N) is N = N0 * (1 - e^(-λt)), where N0 is the initial quantity, N is the remaining after time t. Wait, or is it the probability of decay? Alternatively, the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λt).

Yes, that's right. So the given probability is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Rearranging that, 1 - 0.32 = e^(-λ*100) → 0.68 = e^(-100λ) → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. Since 0.68 is close to 0.7, which I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Let me approximate: natural log of 0.68 is about -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 → approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, perhaps I should get a more precise value. Let me think: ln(0.68) = ?

Alternatively, I can compute ln(0.68) exactly. Using a calculator would be best, but in the absence of that, let's remember that ln(0.68) ≈ −0.38566248. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is: after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So we're at the 50-minute mark, and we've observed it hasn't decayed. What's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, no: the next 150 minutes from the current time (50 minutes passed), so the total time from the start would be 50+150=200 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps it's 150 minutes after the 50 have passed, so the time elapsed would be 50 +150=200 minutes. Or perhaps the 150 minutes is the time from now, so t=150 minutes after the 50-minute mark. Either way, the time from the initial state is 200 minutes.

Wait, no, the time from the initial state would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes from the start.

But when considering the time since the last decay (which hasn't happened yet), the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Because the process doesn't remember how much time has passed.

Wait, but that's only if the 150 minutes is the time after the initial 50. So, perhaps it's better to compute the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200. Let's model it.

The probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays by t=200 minus the probability that it decays by t=50.

So, P(50 < decay < 200) = P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50).

But since it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50)] divided by [1 - P(decayed by 50)].

Wait, yes. So the probability given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is:

P = [P(200) - P(50)] / (1 - P(50)).

Because the condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So we can compute P(200) and P(50), then plug them in.

Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So we can compute the probability for 150 minutes.

Wait, that's a key point. The memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next time interval is independent of how much time has already passed without decay. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes is equal to the probability it decays in 150 minutes from the start.

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because the decay probability for a time t is given by 1 - e^(-λ t). So for time t=150 minutes, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But I should check if the initial setup allows that. Let me think again.

The initial probability after t=100 is 32% decayed. So 32% = 1 - e^(-λ *100). From that, we found λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (from the current time) is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we are looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is 150 minutes from now.

But because of the memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes regardless of the previous 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is simply the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

Wait, but that might not be correct if the decay process has a half-life, for example. Wait, no, the memoryless property holds for the exponential distribution. So the probability of decay in a future interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay.

So, in that case, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, let me compute that.

We have λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ * 150 ≈ 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.5785.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ approximately what? Let's compute that.

We know e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute it more accurately. The exponent is -0.5785.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using the value of λ we calculated.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the decay constant.

Wait, another approach: since the decay follows an exponential model, the probability of decay in a time interval t is P = 1 - e^(-λ t). So for t=150 minutes, it's 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But let's compute λ more accurately.

From before, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100 λ) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566 → λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 min^-1.

Then, λ *150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

We can approximate e^x where x is -0.5785.

We can use the Taylor expansion or remember that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488.

0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can do a linear approximation between x=0.5 and x=0.6.

At x=0.5, e^-x ≈ 0.6065.

At x=0.6, e^-x ≈ 0.5488.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the change is about -0.0577 (from 0.6065 to 0.5488).

Our x is 0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5. So 0.0785 is 78.5% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6.

So the change in e^-x would be approximately 0.0785 * ( -0.0577 / 0.1 ) → since per 0.1 x change, the e^-x decreases by about 0.0577.

So 0.0785 * (0.0577 / 0.1) = 0.0785 * 0.577 = approx 0.0455.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0455 = 0.561.

Wait, but that's an approximation; perhaps a better way is to use the formula for e^x. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the natural logarithm. Let me think: ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, which is close to our exponent of -0.5785.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check.

Wait, e^(-0.5785) ≈ ?

Wait, let me think: e^(-0.5785) = 1 / e^(0.5785).

Compute e^0.5785.

We know e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82212.

At x=0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5.

So e^0.5785 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.0785.

e^0.0785: Let's compute that. Since e^x ≈ 1 +x +x²/2 for small x.

x=0.0785: e^0.0785 ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2 /2.

(0.0785)^2 = 0.00616225, divided by 2 is 0.0030811.

So total ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.0030811 ≈ 1.08158.

So e^0.5785 ≈ e^0.5 * 1.08158 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08158.

Calculating that: 1.64872 * 1.08158.

Let me compute 1.64872 *1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08= 0.131898.

1.64872 * 0.00158 ≈ 0.002603.

Adding up: 1.64872 + 0.131898 = 1.780618 + 0.002603 ≈ 1.783221.

So e^0.5785 ≈ 1.7832. So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 / 1.7832 ≈ 0.561.

So, e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561. So the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%.

Looking at the options:

A)44% → 44% is close to 43.9%.

B)40% → lower.

C)52% → higher.

D)48% → higher.

So the closest is option A) 44%.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the approach should consider the time elapsed.

Wait, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the initial 100-minute decay probability was 32%, but 50 minutes have passed. So the time from now is 150 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay probability for the next 150 minutes is computed as the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes without any prior time. So the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

Alternatively, the probability could be calculated as the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Which would be (P(50 + 150) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).

So let's compute P(50), P(200), and then compute (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).

Compute P(50) = 1 - e^(-λ *50).

λ is 0.0038566.

So 50 * λ = 0.19283. e^(-0.19283) ≈ ?

e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.825.

Because e^(-0.2) is about 0.8187. So 0.19283 is a bit less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.825.

So P(50) ≈ 1 - 0.825 = 0.175 → 17.5%.

P(200) = 1 - e^(-λ *200) = 1 - e^(-0.77132).

e^-0.77132 ≈ ?

We know that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.77132 is a bit less. Let's compute more accurately.

0.77132 is approximately 0.77. e^-0.77 ≈ ?

We can calculate:

We know that ln(0.46) ≈ -0.7765 → which is a bit higher than our exponent. So e^-0.77 ≈ 0.462.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let me use a calculator-like approach.

e^0.77 → let's compute:

e^0.7 ≈ 2.01375.

e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725.

So e^0.77 = e^(0.7 + 0.07) = e^0.7 * e^0.07 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.0725 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.07 ≈ 2.154.

Wait, 2.01375 * 1.0725:

2 *1.0725 = 2.145.

0.01375 *1.0725 ≈ 0.0147656.

So total ≈ 2.145 + 0.0147656 ≈ 2.1598.

So e^0.77 ≈ 2.1598. So e^-0.77 ≈ 1/2.1598 ≈ 0.4626.

So P(200) = 1 - 0.4626 ≈ 0.5374 → 53.74%.

So the conditional probability is (53.74% - 17.5%) / (1 - 17.5%) = (36.24%) / (82.5%) ≈ 0.3624 / 0.825 ≈ 0.439 → 43.9%.

Which is again approximately 44%, so option A.

Wait, that seems to concur with the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximation.

Let me try to compute λ more accurately.

From 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68.

Take natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68).

ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.385662.

So λ = 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, let's compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

λ*150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) = 1 / e^0.578493.

Compute e^0.578493:

We can use the Taylor series around 0.5.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, use the fact that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's compute e^0.578493.

We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82212.

Compute 0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.

Using a linear approximation between x=0.5 and x=0.6.

The slope at x=0.5 is e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

The slope at x=0.6 is e^0.6 ≈ 1.82212.

The change from x=0.5 to x=0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the change in e^x is 1.82212 - 1.64872 = 0.1734.

So, for a small change dx=0.078493, the change in e^x would be approximately (0.078493 / 0.1) * 0.1734 ≈ 0.78493 * 0.1734 ≈ 0.1365.

So e^0.578493 ≈ e^0.5 + 0.1365 ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1365 ≈ 1.78522.

So e^0.578493 ≈ 1.78522 → e^-0.578493 ≈ 1 / 1.78522 ≈ 0.56.

So P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 → 44%.

So the answer would be 44%, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute λ more accurately.

Wait, another approach: since we have λ = ln(1/(1 - p)) / t, where p is the probability of decay in time t. So for t=100, p=0.32.

λ = ln(1/0.68) / 100 = ln(1.470588) / 100.

ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.385662.

So λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 → 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, let's compute e^(-λ *150).

0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

e^-0.578493 ≈ 0.561 (from earlier calculations).

So probability of decay in 150 min is 0.439, about 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A) 44%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential model. The probability of decay within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we calculate:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we are tasked with finding the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval (150 minutes), not on the elapsed 50 minutes.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.5785} \), we approximate:

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561
\]

Therefore:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the probability is approximately **44%**.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **A) 44%**: Matches the calculated probability of 43.9%.
- **B) 40%**: Too low compared to the computed value.
- **C) 52%**: Too high compared to the computed value.
- **D) 48%**: Slightly higher than the computed value but closer to 44%.

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think out loud here.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. That means the probability it hasn't decayed by 100 minutes is 68%, right? Because 100% minus 32% is 68%.

Now, the scenario here is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: Does that mean the next 150 minutes starting from the beginning, or the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed? Oh, the way it's phrased, "the next 150 minutes" probably refers to after the 50 minutes have elapsed. So the total time from now would be 150 minutes.

Yes, that's right. So the given probability is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Calculating that. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. Since 0.68 is close to 0.7, which I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Let me approximate: natural log of 0.68 is about -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 → approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is: after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So we're at the 50-minute mark, and we've observed it hasn't decayed. What's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, no: the next 150 minutes from the current time (50 minutes passed), so the total time from the start would be 50+150=200 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps it's 150 minutes after the 50 have passed, so the time elapsed would be 50 +150=200 minutes. Or perhaps the 150 minutes is the time from now, so t=150 minutes after the 50-minute mark. Either way, the time from the initial state is 200 minutes.

Wait, no, the time from the initial state would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes from the start.

But when considering the time since the last decay (which hasn't happened yet), the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Because the process doesn't remember how much time has passed.

Wait, but that's only if the 150 minutes is the time after the initial 50. So, perhaps it's better to compute the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200. Let's model it.

The probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays by t=200 minus the probability that it decays by t=50.

So, P(50 < decay < 200) = P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50).

But since it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50)] divided by [1 - P(decayed by 50)].

Wait, yes. So the probability given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is:

P = [P(200) - P(50)] / (1 - P(50)).

Because the condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So we can compute P(200) and P(50), then plug them in.

Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So we can compute the probability for 150 minutes.

But I should check if the initial setup allows that. Let me think again.

The initial probability after t=100 is 32% decayed. So 32% = 1 - e^(-λ *100). From that, we found λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (from the current time) is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we are looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is 150 minutes from now.

But because of the memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes regardless of the previous 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is simply the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

Wait, but that might not be correct if the decay process has a half-life, for example. Wait, no, the memoryless property holds for the exponential distribution. So the probability of decay in a future interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay.

So, in that case, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, let me compute that.

We have λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ * 150 ≈ 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.5785.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ approximately what? Let's compute that.

We know e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute it more accurately. The exponent is -0.5785.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using the value of λ we calculated.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the decay constant.

Wait, another approach: since the decay follows an exponential model, the probability of decay in a time interval t is P = 1 - e^(-λ t). So for t=150 minutes, it's 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But let's compute λ more accurately.

From before, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100 λ) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566 → λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 min^-1.

Then, λ *150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

We can approximate e^x where x is -0.5785.

We can use the Taylor expansion or remember that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488.

0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can do a linear approximation between x=0.5 and x=0.6.

At x=0.5, e^-x ≈ 0.6065.

At x=0.6, e^-x ≈ 0.5488.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the change is about -0.0577 (from 0.6065 to 0.5488).

Our x is 0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5. So 0.0785 is 78.5% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6.

So the change in e^-x would be approximately 0.0785 * ( -0.0577 / 0.1 ) → since per 0.1 x change, the e^-x decreases by about 0.0577.

So 0.0785 * (0.0577 / 0.1) = 0.0785 * 0.577 = approx 0.0455.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0455 = 0.561.

Wait, but that's an approximation; perhaps a better way is to use the formula for e^x. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the natural logarithm. Let me think: ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, which is close to our exponent of -0.5785.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check.

Wait, e^(-0.5785) ≈ ?

Wait, let me think: e^(-0.5785) = 1 / e^(0.5785).

Compute e^0.5785.

We know e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82212.

At x=0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5.

So e^0.5785 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.0785.

e^0.0785: Let's compute that. Since e^x ≈ 1 +x +x²/2 for small x.

x=0.0785: e^0.0785 ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2 /2.

(0.0785)^2 = 0.00616225, divided by 2 is 0.0030811.

So total ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.0030811 ≈ 1.08158.

So e^0.5785 ≈ e^0.5 * 1.08158 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08158.

Calculating that: 1.64872 * 1.08158.

Let me compute 1.64872 *1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08= 0.131898.

1.64872 * 0.00158 ≈ 0.002603.

Adding up: 1.64872 + 0.131898 = 1.780618 + 0.002603 ≈ 1.783221.

So e^0.5785 ≈ 1.7832. So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 / 1.7832 ≈ 0.561.

So, e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561. So the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%.

Looking at the options:

A)44% → 44% is close to 43.9%.

B)40% → lower.

C)52% → higher.

D)48% → higher.

So the closest is option A) 44%.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the approach should consider the time elapsed.

Wait, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the initial 100-minute decay probability was 32%, but 50 minutes have passed. So the time from now is 150 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay probability for the next 150 minutes is computed as the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes without any prior time. So the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

Alternatively, the probability could be calculated as the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Which would be (P(50 + 150) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).

So let's compute P(50), P(200), and then compute (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).

Compute P(50) = 1 - e^(-λ *50).

λ is 0.0038566.

So 50 * λ = 0.19283. e^(-0.19283) ≈ ?

e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.825.

Because e^(-0.2) is about 0.8187. So 0.19283 is a bit less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.825.

So P(50) ≈ 1 - 0.825 = 0.175 → 17.5%.

P(200) = 1 - e^(-λ *200) = 1 - e^(-0.77132).

e^-0.77132 ≈ ?

We know that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.77132 is a bit less. Let's compute more accurately.

0.77132 is approximately 0.77. e^-0.77 ≈ ?

We can calculate:

We know that ln(0.46) ≈ -0.7765 → which is a bit higher than our exponent. So e^-0.77 ≈ 0.462.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let me use a calculator-like approach.

e^0.77 → let's compute:

e^0.7 ≈ 2.01375.

e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725.

So e^0.77 = e^(0.7 + 0.07) = e^0.7 * e^0.07 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.0725 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.07 ≈ 2.154.

Wait, 2.01375 * 1.0725:

2 *1.0725 = 2.145.

0.01375 *1.0725 ≈ 0.0147656.

So total ≈ 2.145 + 0.0147656 ≈ 2.1598.

So e^0.77 ≈ 2.1598. So e^-0.77 ≈ 1/2.1598 ≈ 0.4626.

So P(200) = 1 - 0.4626 ≈ 0.5374 → 53.74%.

So the conditional probability is (53.74% - 17.5%) / (1 - 17.5%) = (36.24%) / (82.5%) ≈ 0.3624 / 0.825 ≈ 0.439 → 43.9%.

Which is again approximately 44%, so option A.

Wait, that seems to concur with the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximation.

Let me try to compute λ more accurately.

From 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68.

Take natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68).

ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.385662.

So λ = 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, let's compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

λ*150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) = 1 / e^0.578493.

Compute e^0.578493:

We can use the Taylor series around 0.5.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, use the fact that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's compute e^0.578493.

We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82212.

Compute 0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.

Using a linear approximation between x=0.5 and x=0.6.

The slope at x=0.5 is e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

The slope at x=0.6 is e^0.6 ≈ 1.82212.

The change from x=0.5 to x=0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the change in e^x is 1.82212 - 1.64872 = 0.1734.

So, for a small change dx=0.078493, the change in e^x would be approximately (0.078493 / 0.1) * 0.1734 ≈ 0.78493 * 0.1734 ≈ 0.1365.

So e^0.578493 ≈ e^0.5 + 0.1365 ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1365 ≈ 1.78522.

So e^0.578493 ≈ 1.78522 → e^-0.578493 ≈ 1 / 1.78522 ≈ 0.56.

So P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 → 44%.

So the answer would be 44%, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute λ more accurately.

Wait, another approach: since we have λ = ln(1/(1 - p)) / t, where p is the probability of decay in time t. So for t=100, p=0.32.

λ = ln(1/0.68) / 100 = ln(1.470588) / 100.

ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.385662.

So λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 → 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, let's compute e^(-λ *150).

0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

e^-0.578493 ≈ 0.561 (from earlier calculations).

So probability of decay in 150 min is 0.439, about 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential model. The probability of decay within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we calculate:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we are tasked with finding the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval (150 minutes), not on the elapsed 50 minutes.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.5785} \), we approximate:

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561
\]

Therefore:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the probability is approximately **44%**.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **A) 44%**: Matches the calculated probability of 43.9%.
- **B) 40%**: Too low compared to the computed value.
- **C) 52%**: Too high compared to the computed value.
- **D) 48%**: Slightly higher than the computed value but closer to 44%.

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.
