Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with a different value in eV.

Wait, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh right, it's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for this problem, how does that apply?

The uncertainty in time here is probably related to the lifetimes of the states. Since the states have different lifetimes, maybe the uncertainty in time Δt is connected to those lifetimes. Oh, wait, I think in this context, the lifetime τ is related to the uncertainty in time Δt. I remember that Δt is about 1/τ because a longer lifetime means a more precise measurement of time, hence a smaller Δt. So for each state, Δt would be approximately τ.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So I guess each state has its own Δt. But how does that relate to being able to distinguish the two energy levels? Hmm, maybe the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, otherwise they might not be resolvable.

Wait, no, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but each state has its own energy uncertainty. Let me think. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately ħ/(2Δt). Since Δt here is the lifetime τ, we can write ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ).

So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). Similarly, for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2e-8).

Wait, but what's the value of ħ? I think it's approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But when working in eV and seconds, I might need to convert. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So to convert ħ into eV·s, I can compute ħ (J·s) divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

Let me compute ħ in eV·s. So, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV: 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * τ).

For the first state, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = about 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = (6.582/(2)) * 1e-8 eV. Wait, 2e-8 is the denominator, so 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 6.582/(2) * 1e-8 (since 1e-16 / 1e-8 = 1e-8). So that's about 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, so the energy uncertainty for each state is about 3.29e-7 eV for state 1, and 3.29e-8 eV for state 2.

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let's call ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if ΔE is too small, the uncertainties might cause the energy levels to overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, but each state has its own ΔE. So I'm a bit confused. Do I need to consider the maximum of the two uncertainties, or the sum? Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from both states, so that the intervals don't overlap.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties, then the two energy levels won't overlap. So (E2 - E1) > (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Let me compute the sum of the two uncertainties. ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than about 3.6e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3.6e-7. So no, too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No way.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 1e-4, which is 1e-4 / 3.6e-7 ≈ 277 times larger. So yes, this is much larger than the required 3.6e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, which is about 0.03 times 3.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. So this would not be sufficient.

So the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me double-check the calculations. Because the question is about the energy difference required to clearly resolve the two energy levels. Another possibility is that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state's energy, but perhaps each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. So if the energy difference is larger than the maximum of the two ΔE, or perhaps the sum, then they can be distinguished.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are like intervals around each state. For E1, the interval is [E1 - ΔE1, E1 + ΔE1], and for E2, [E2 - ΔE2, E2 + ΔE2]. To distinguish them, these intervals must not overlap. So the distance between E1 and E2 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So our required ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let me compute that.

ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV. So sum is 3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV. So ΔE needs to be greater than 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 → which is 1e-4 / 3.6e-7 = approx 277.78 times larger. So yes, that's way above.

Options A, B, D are all smaller than 3.6e-7. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is related to the lifetime \( \tau \) of the states, such that \( \Delta t \approx \tau \). For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}
\]

The reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). Using this, the energy uncertainties for the two states are:

- For the first state (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

- For the second state (\( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

The sum of the uncertainties is:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is approximately \( 277.8 \) times larger than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.

So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). Similarly, for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2e-8).

So, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * τ).

For the first state, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = about 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = (6.582/(2)) * 1e-8 eV. Wait, 2e-8 is the denominator, so 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 6.582/(2) * 1e-8 (since 1e-16 / 1e-8 = 1e-8). So that's about 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, so the energy uncertainty for each state is about 3.29e-7 eV for state 1, and 3.29e-8 eV for state 2.

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let's call ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
