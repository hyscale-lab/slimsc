Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. But wait, which one should I use? Oh, the problem says "their lifetime," which might refer to each state's lifetime. But I think the approach is to take the minimum uncertainty, so maybe the shorter lifetime would determine the uncertainty. Because the lifetime is the time for which the energy is measured. So the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty in energy.

So Δt for each state is different. Hmm, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So perhaps the uncertainty in each energy would be based on their own lifetimes. Wait no, maybe when trying to measure the energy difference, the relevant time is the time over which the measurement is made. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe when the two states have different lifetimes, the energy difference must be such that the uncertainty from each state allows them to be resolved. So to clearly distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference (ΔE) should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties from each state? Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty for each state, ensuring that the difference is larger than either.

Wait, let me think again. The uncertainty in energy for each state would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2). But wait, the energy difference between them is ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each state's uncertainty must be smaller than ΔE/2, so that the two can be distinguished.

Alternatively, the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty principle. For a measurement, the time over which you measure determines the precision of your energy measurement. If you measure for Δt, then ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. So the energy resolution ΔE is approximately ħ/(Δt).

But in this problem, each state has its own Δt. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ/(2*Δt1), and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2). The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. We need ΔE = E2 - E1 to be larger than the combined uncertainties, maybe something like ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but another approach: The energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that the two levels don't overlap in their energy measurements. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) must be such that the difference between their energies is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the time we should consider is the time for which the system is observed. But in this case, each state has a different lifetime. So perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime, as that's a higher uncertainty.

Wait, let me think. Let's compute the uncertainty for each state.

Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE1 ≈ 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, Δt2 = 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 ≈ 1.05e-34 / (2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J → 5.27e-27 /1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, in terms of energy, E is measured in eV, so the uncertainty for E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, I think. So ΔE = E2 - E1 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So adding 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than that. Option A is 1e-9, which is smaller than 3.29e-7. So if the energy difference is larger than 3.6e-7 eV, then we can distinguish them. So any ΔE larger than that would work.

But wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the energy resolution being determined by the uncertainty in the measurement. If we have a measurement of ΔE, then if the actual energy difference is larger than that, we can see it.

Wait, but the uncertainty principle tells us that the minimum detectable energy difference is on the order of ħ/Δt. So perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty for the measurement time.

Wait, but the measurement time would be the time over which we can observe the state. The longer the time, the lower the uncertainty. But in our problem, each state has a different lifetime. So for E1, which has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), the uncertainty is higher (3.29e-7 eV). For E2, it's lower (3.29e-8 eV).

If we're trying to measure the energy difference between E1 and E2, perhaps the measurement time Δt is the same for both. But that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the measurement time is the minimum of the two lifetimes because beyond that, the state would decay.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each state. So ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is larger than either state's energy uncertainty, then we can tell them apart.

So if ΔE is larger than both 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV, then the question is, which option is larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → much smaller than 3.29e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C)1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 10,000e-7 → way larger than 3.29e-7.

D)1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.1e-7 → which is larger than 3.29e-8 but smaller than 3.29e-7.

So option C is way larger than 3.29e-7, so it meets the condition. Option D is 1e-8, which is about 3 times larger than E2's uncertainty but smaller than E1's uncertainty. So would that be enough?

Wait, if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or just larger than the individual uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. So the uncertainty in energy would be the maximum between the two, perhaps. Or maybe the sum.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can take the uncertainty for the measurement as the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 s. The uncertainty in energy for each would be ħ/(2Δt). So for E1, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV. For E2, ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

If our energy difference ΔE is larger than ΔE1, then certainly it's larger than ΔE2. So if ΔE is more than 3.29e-7 eV, we can distinguish them.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is bigger than that. So option C would be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait another approach. The measurement time would determine the energy resolution. So if we have a system that can measure for a certain time, the energy resolution ΔE is approximately ħ/Δt.

But in this problem, each state has a different lifetime. So perhaps the measurement can be made for the longer of the two lifetimes, which is 1e-8 s. So Δt would be 1e-8 s.

Then, ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J → 5.27e-27 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy resolution would be about 3.29e-8 eV. So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than this. Looking at the options:

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 3 times larger than 3.29e-8.

But wait, 1e-8 is larger than 3.29e-8? No, 3.29e-8 is approximately 3.29 x 1e-8, which is 3.29e-8. So 1e-8 is actually smaller than that. So option D would not satisfy ΔE > 3.29e-8.

Wait, 3.29e-8 is about 3.29 x10^-8. Option D is 1e-8, which is less than that. So option D wouldn't be sufficient.

Then, the next option that's larger is option C (1e-4 eV), which is way larger than 3.29e-8.

So, according to that, option C is the correct choice.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the uncertainty from each state. If the two states have their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty would be the sum.

So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than that.

So looking for ΔE > 3.62e-7 eV. Among the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, much larger than 3.6e-7.

So the correct answer would be C.

To determine the energy difference \( \Delta E \) that allows two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For a given state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for clear distinction
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 10,000 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.

Wait, perhaps the time we should consider is the time for which the system is observed. But in this case, each state has a different lifetime. So perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime, as that's a higher uncertainty.

Wait, let me think. Let's compute the uncertainty for each state.

Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE1 ≈ 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, Δt2 = 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 ≈ 1.05e-34 / (2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J → 5.27e-27 /1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, in terms of energy, E is measured in eV, so the uncertainty for E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, I think. So ΔE = E2 - E1 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So adding 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than that. Option A is 1e-9, which is smaller than 3.29e-7. So if the energy difference is larger than 3.6e-7 eV, then we can distinguish them. So any ΔE larger than that would work.

But wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the energy resolution being determined by the uncertainty in the measurement. If we have a measurement of ΔE, then if the actual energy difference is larger than that, we can see it.

Wait, but the uncertainty principle tells us that the minimum detectable energy difference is on the order of ħ/Δt. So perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty for the measurement time.

Wait, but the measurement time would be the time over which we can observe the state. The longer the time, the lower the uncertainty. But in our problem, each state has a different lifetime. So for E1, which has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), the uncertainty is higher (3.29e-7 eV). For E2, it's lower (3.29e-8 eV).

If we're trying to measure the energy difference between E1 and E2, perhaps the measurement time Δt is the same for both. But that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the measurement time is the minimum of the two lifetimes because beyond that, the state would decay.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each state. So ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is larger than either state's energy uncertainty, then we can tell them apart.

So if ΔE is larger than both 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV, then the question is, which option is larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → much smaller than 3.29e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C)1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 10,000e-7 → way larger than 3.29e-7.

D)1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.1e-7 → which is larger than 3.29e-8 but smaller than 3.29e-7.

So option C is way larger than 3.29e-7, so it meets the condition. Option D is 1e-8, which is about 3 times larger than E2's uncertainty but smaller than E1's uncertainty. So would that be enough?

Wait, if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or just larger than the individual uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. So the uncertainty in energy would be the maximum between the two, perhaps. Or maybe the sum.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can take the uncertainty for the measurement as the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 s. The uncertainty in energy for each would be ħ/(2Δt). So for E1, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV. For E2, ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

If our energy difference ΔE is larger than ΔE1, then certainly it's larger than ΔE2. So if ΔE is more than 3.29e-7 eV, we can distinguish them.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is bigger than that. So option C would be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait another approach. The measurement time would determine the energy resolution. So if we have a system that can measure for a certain time, the energy resolution ΔE is approximately ħ/Δt.

But in this problem, each state has a different lifetime. So perhaps the measurement can be made for the longer of the two lifetimes, which is 1e-8 s. So Δt would be 1e-8 s.

Then, ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J → 5.27e-27 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy resolution would be about 3.29e-8 eV. So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than this. Looking at the options:

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 3 times larger than 3.29e-8.

But wait, 1e-8 is larger than 3.29e-8? No, 3.29e-8 is approximately 3.29 x 1e-8, which is 3.29e-8. So 1e-8 is actually smaller than that. So option D would not satisfy ΔE > 3.29e-8.

Wait, 3.29e-8 is about 3.29 x10^-8. Option D is 1e-8, which is less than that. So option D wouldn't be sufficient.

Then, the next option that's larger is option C (1e-4 eV), which is way larger than 3.29e-8.

So, according to that, option C is the correct choice.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the uncertainty from each state. If the two states have their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty would be the sum.

So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than that.

So looking for ΔE > 3.62e-7 eV. Among the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, much larger than 3.6e-7.

So the correct answer would be C.


To determine the energy difference \( \Delta E \) that allows two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For a given state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for clear distinction
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 10,000 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.

Answer: C
