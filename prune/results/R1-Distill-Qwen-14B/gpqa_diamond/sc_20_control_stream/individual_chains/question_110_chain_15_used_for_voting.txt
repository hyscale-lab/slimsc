Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are used for high-resolution spectroscopy, but their detection limits might differ.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters, and I need to figure out which ones can be seen by both instruments. The key point is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can handle stars up to V mag 16. So the star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait no, wait—wait, the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed, meaning V <17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its V is less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, but wait—the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". So the maximum apparent V magnitude they can see is 17. So for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 17. But wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh, no—brighter than 17 would mean V mag less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So the limit is up to 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES.

Wait, no, no. Let me clarify: The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So if a telescope can observe stars "brighter than 17 mag", that means the apparent V magnitude is less than 17, right? Because if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17.

So for a star to be detectable by both instruments, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 (since HIRES can't see beyond 16) and less than or equal to 17 (ESPRESSO can go up to 17). But since both need to detect, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it. So the star must have V mag ≤16 for both.

Wait wait, because for each instrument, the star must be within their magnitude limits. So for both to detect it, the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the stricter limit. So any star with V mag ≤16 can be detected by both, because HIRES requires ≤16 and ESPRESSO allows up to 17. So stars with V mag ≤16 are acceptable for both.

Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Apparent V mag = absolute mag if distance is 10 pc because m - M = 5 log (d/10). So 10 pc: m -15.5=0 → m=15.5. So apparent mag 15.5. Both instruments can see this because 15.5 is less than 16. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. But HIRES can only go up to 16. So 16.5 is beyond, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag given as 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V) = 0.6). The question says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent mag without extinction would be m0 = m_observed - A_V. Wait, no: the observed magnitude is m = m0 + A_V. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher mag). So Star3's observed V mag is 15.5, but the intrinsic (without extinction) would be m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait no, wait. Wait, if the star emits a certain brightness, but dust makes it appear dimmer, then the extinction adds to the magnitude. So the observed m is m0 + A_V. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then m_observed = m0 + A_V. So when you observe m_obs, the actual m0 is m_obs - A_V.

Wait wait, perhaps I have it backwards. Let me think again. If a star has an apparent magnitude m0 without any extinction, and there's extinction A, then the observed magnitude would be m = m0 + A. Because extinction dims the star; makes it appear fainter (higher magnitude). So in the case of Star3, the apparent V mag given is 15.5, which includes the extinction. But wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the total including extinction. But for the purpose of the spectrograph detection, the brightness is the observed (total) magnitude, right? Because that's what determines how much light we receive.

Wait, no. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think. The problem is whether the star's apparent magnitude is bright enough for the instrument. The apparent magnitude is the observed brightness. So if Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so it's within both instruments' limits. But wait, wait, wait. The question says: for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So the V magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, how does that affect the brightness? Wait, no, the apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. Because if it didn't, the given apparent magnitude would be the uncorrected one. So when they say Star3's apparent V is 15.5, that's already including extinction? Or is that the intrinsic magnitude, and the extinction is an additional factor?

Wait, the question states: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So the apparent V mag is 15.5, but extinction is given as E(B-V)=0.6. So I think the extinction would add to the apparent magnitude. Because without extinction, the star would appear brighter. So the observed apparent magnitude is higher (dimmer) because of extinction. So the observed m is m0 + A_V, where m0 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So m_obs = m0 + A_V. So if m_obs is 15.5, then m0 = 15.5 - A_V. Wait, but A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So without extinction, Star3 would have apparent mag 13.64, which is brighter than 15.5. So its apparent mag is 15.5 (with extinction), which is less than 16, so both instruments can detect it. Wait, but wait—wait, the spectrographs detect the observed brightness, which includes extinction. So m_obs is 15.5, which is brighter than 16? No, 15.5 is less than 16, so it's within both limits. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait no, no. Let's clarify. The spectrograph's limit is set based on the apparent magnitude as observed through the interstellar medium (i.e., including extinction). So the brightness the instrument receives is the observed (m_obs) which is m0 + A_V. So the detection limit is based on the observed m_obs. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO (≤17) and HIRES (≤16). So yes, both can detect it.

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent V mag is 15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1 * 0.4=1.24. So observed m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74? No, wait, no, because m_obs = m0 + A_V. Wait, no, wait. The absolute magnitude is M, which is the apparent mag at 10 pc. So Star4 is at 10 pc, so m0 (without extinction) = M =15.5. But extinction causes m_obs = m0 + A_V. So m_obs = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74. So the apparent magnitude including extinction is 16.74. That's higher than 16. So for HIRES, which can't go beyond 16, this star would be too faint. So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is okay. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So it's not detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Star4 is at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude without extinction is M=15.5. But wait, no, M is the absolute magnitude, so the apparent magnitude (without considering distance) is m = M + 5 log (d/10). So d=10 pc, so log(1)=0, m = M =15.5. So m0 (without extinction) is 15.5. But with extinction, the observed m_obs = 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74. So the apparent magnitude is 16.74, which is greater than 16. So HIRES cannot detect it (only up to 16), but ESPRESSO can handle up to 17. So Star4 is observable by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So not both.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. So apparent magnitude without extinction would be m = M + 5 log (d/10). So d=5, log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.301. So m =16.5 +5*(-0.301) =16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15. So m0=15.0. But the question doesn't mention extinction for Star5, so E(B-V) is zero. So no extinction, so m_obs =m0=15.0. Both instruments can detect it since 15<16. So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, the question says Star5 has an absolute V mag of 16.5. So m = M + 5 log (d/10). So d=5 pc. 5 log (5/10)=5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So approximately 15.0. So apparent V mag is 15.0. Both instruments can detect it.

Now, let's go back to each star and see which can be detected by both instruments.

Which stars have apparent V mag ≤ 16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16, and both must detect it):

Star1: 15.5 → yes
Star2: 16.5 → no (HIRES can't)
Star3: 15.5 → yes
Star4: 16.74 → no (HIRES can't)
Star5: 15.0 → yes

Wait no, wait, Star3: the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, so it's within both.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: yes
Star3: yes
Star5: yes

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by both, so A is out.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So B is a possibility.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be seen by HIRES, so C is out.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES, so D is out.

So the correct answer would include Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes for both.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15 → yes.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible correct options are:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

So the options are only A to D, and the correct pairs are Star3 and Star5 (option B) and Star1 and Star5?

Wait, wait, no. Because option D is Star1 and Star4, but Star4 can’t be detected by both.

Wait, which options pair stars that can be detected by both.

Looking again:

Which stars have apparent V mag <=16.

Star1: 15.5 → yes.

Star3: 15.5 → yes.

Star5: 15 → yes.

Star2: 16.5 → no.

Star4: 16.74 → no.

So the possible pairs:

Star1 and Star3: but is Star1 in any option?

Looking at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't.

Is there any option that includes Star1 and Star5? No.

The options given don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is Star3 and Star5.

But wait, Star1 is also detectable by both. So why isn't it in any of the options? Let me look again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the only correct pair is B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 (i.e., \( V \leq 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 (i.e., \( V \leq 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude \( V \leq 16 \) to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = M = 15.5 \) (since \( m - M = 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 0 \)).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so it is not detectable by HIRES, even though it is detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude is already given as \( m = 15.5 \), which includes extinction.  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude without extinction \( m_0 = M = 15.5 \).  
   - Extinction \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude \( m = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( m = 16.74 > 16 \), so it is not detectable by HIRES, even though it is detectable by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 \approx 15.0 \).  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are paired correctly.

**Options Analysis**:
- **A) Star4 and Star5**: Star4 is not detectable by HIRES, so this is incorrect.  
- **B) Star3 and Star5**: Both stars are detectable by both instruments, so this is correct.  
- **C) Star2 and Star3**: Star2 is not detectable by HIRES, so this is incorrect.  
- **D) Star1 and Star4**: Star4 is not detectable by HIRES, so this is incorrect.

**Final Answer**:  
Answer: B
