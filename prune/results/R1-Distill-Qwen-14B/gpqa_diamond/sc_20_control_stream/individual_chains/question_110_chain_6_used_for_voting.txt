Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that spectrographs have certain brightness limits, so I need to figure out the apparent magnitudes of each star and see if they're within the detectable ranges of both instruments.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with varying properties. For each, I need to calculate their apparent magnitude, considering any extinction (absorption) due to dust, if applicable. Then, I'll check if each star is brighter than the required magnitude for both spectrographs.

First, let's recap the brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Wait, magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, which means any star with V ≤17 is detectable.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, stars with V ≤16 mag are detectable by HIRES.

Wait, no. Let me double-check the problem statement. Oh right: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star's apparent V is less than or equal to 17, it's visible. Same for HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag (so V ≤ 16 mag) can be seen.

So, each star needs to have an apparent magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. To be detected by both, it must satisfy both conditions. So the apparent V must be ≤16 mag because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no, no. Wait, because a star that is brighter than 16 mag (V ≤16) would be detectable by HIRES, but for ESPRESSO, it's allowed up to 17. So any star that is ≤16 would be detectable by both. But wait, what about stars that are between 16 and 17 mag? They can be detected by ESPRESSO, but not by HIRES. So the question is, which stars have apparent V ≤16 mag?

So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see if it's ≤16 for each, and also whether it's ≤17. But since HIRES is more sensitive (up to 16), only stars with V ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait no, the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So a star must satisfy both conditions: apparent V ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and apparent V ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no! Because if a star is dimmer than 16, say 17, then HIRES can't detect it. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V ≤16 mag. Because HIRES can't see stars dimmer than 16.

Wait, no—Wait, let's clarify:

ESPRESSO: can observe stars with V ≤17. So if a star's V is 17 or brighter (which would have V=17 is dimmer, but the magnitude scale is tricky). Wait, no—apparent magnitude scale. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V up to 17 mag (so V ≤17). HIRES can observe stars with V up to 16 mag (so V ≤16).

Thus, a star must have V ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if it's 17, it's visible by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So the question is, which stars have apparent V ≤16 mag?

Wait, but some stars may have intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude) and a distance, so we can calculate their apparent magnitude. Also, some stars have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent magnitude. So for those, we have to calculate the extinction and add it to the apparent magnitude.

Wait, let me clarify: the formula for apparent magnitude is:

m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) + A_V

Where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and A_V is the extinction in the V band.

Wait, wait. The formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10) ), which simplifies to m = M +5 + 5 log10 d - 5? No, wait: 5 log10(d/10) = 5(log10 d - 1) =5 log10 d -5. So m = M + 5 log10 d -5.

But wait, the formula is m - M = 5 log10 (d / 10 pc) ), so m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10 ), which is m = M +5 (log10 d - 1) = M -5 +5 log10 d.

Alternatively, m = M + 5 log10 (d) -5.

But that's without considering extinction. Extinction, A_V, is added to the apparent magnitude because dust dims the star, making it appear fainter (higher m value). So the correct formula is:

m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V

Where m_intrinsic is the apparent magnitude without extinction, calculated from m = M +5 log10 d -5.

So, for each star, we need to compute m_intrinsic, then add A_V (if applicable), to get the apparent magnitude that we actually observe.

Alternatively, when extinction is given as E(B-V), and A_V is related by a coefficient. The problem says for Star3 and Star4, E(B-V) is 0.6 and 0.4 respectively, and the total absorption in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:

RA=15, DEC=-75, Mv =15.5, distance =10 pc.

No extinction mentioned, so A_V=0.

Compute m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10, log10(10)=1.

m =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5 +5 -5 =15.5.

So apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is ≤16. So it's detectable by both, right? Because it's 15.5, which is less than 16 and 17.

Wait, but wait: wait, Star1's V magnitude is 15.5, so for ESPRESSO (max 17), it's okay. For HIRES, max 16, so 15.5 is okay. So Star1 can be detected by both. Hmm, but let's check other stars.

Star2:

RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Wait, wait, the data says apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's the m_observed. So no need to compute; it's given.

So, m_observed=16.5.

Which is for ESPRESSO (max 17): 16.5 is okay. For HIRES (max 16): 16.5 is higher than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So Star2 is not a candidate for being detected by both.

Star3:

RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15 pc.

Wait, wait, here the given apparent V mag is 15.5. But wait, that's before extinction? Or is that the observed? Let me read the question again.

Looking back: Star3's data says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6...". Oh, wait, the way it's written: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, so perhaps the given apparent magnitude already includes extinction? Or is it the intrinsic magnitude? Hmm, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Because the way the question is worded, it gives the apparent V magnitude as 15.5, but then also gives E(B-V) = 0.6, so that's a bit conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we need to calculate the observed m by adding A_V? Let me reevaluate.

Wait, looking at the question:

Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, that's not compatible. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed color and the intrinsic color. If the apparent magnitude is given, that's already the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So perhaps that's a mistake in the question.

Wait, but the question also says for Star3: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V = 1.86.

But wait, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5. How is that possible? Because the apparent magnitude already includes the extinction. If the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the apparent magnitude would be higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. So if the question gives apparent magnitude as 15.5, but then also provides E(B-V), which would increase the apparent magnitude, that would mean the given 15.5 is the intrinsic m, and we have to add A_V to get the observed m.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think.

Intrinsic apparent magnitude is m0. Observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m0 + A_V.

If the question says the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but there's extinction, then that can't be. So maybe the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the E(B-V) is provided to calculate the observed m.

Wait, but the problem statement for Star3 says: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.' Hmm, that would imply that the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed magnitude (since it's the apparent, which is what we measure). But then, E(B-V) is given, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps in the question, the 'apparent V magnitude' is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the extinction (A_V) is calculated from E(B-V). In that case, the total apparent magnitude would be 15.5 + A_V.

Wait, that's the only way the data makes sense. Because if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, and the star has a lot of extinction, then the observed m would be much higher.

So perhaps the data is as follows:

For Star3, the apparent magnitude before considering extinction is 15.5. But due to extinction, the observed m would be 15.5 + A_V.

Wait, but that's not how it works. Wait, no: the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but here, m_intrinsic would be the apparent magnitude without extinction. But if the star's light is affected by dust, the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the intrinsic.

So, for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's without considering extinction. So the actual observed m is 15.5 + 3.1 * 0.6 = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36.

Wait, that would make the star's apparent magnitude 17.36, which is beyond the ESPRESSO limit. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So 17.36 is too faint for ESPRESSO. But wait, the question is, can it be detected with both spectrographs? So in this case, Star3's observed m is 17.36. So for ESPRESSO (max 17), it's too faint. So Star3 can't be detected by either. Wait, but wait the options say Star3 is in options B and C.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude already accounts for the extinction, and E(B-V) is provided for other purposes. But that would make the A_V calculation redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question means that the star's absolute magnitude is 15.5, not the apparent. But the question says the apparent V is 15.5.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach.

Let me tabulate each star:

Star1:

Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(d) -5.

log10(10)=1.

m_intrinsic =15.5 +5(1) -5 =15.5.

No extinction. So observed m=15.5.

So for both spectrographs: 15.5 ≤16 and ≤17. So yes, detectable by both. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2:

apparent V=16.5, d=5 pc (but irrelevant because the apparent is given).

So m_observed=16.5.

ESPRESSO can go up to 17: 16.5 ≤17 → yes.

HIRES: 16.5 >16 → no.

So Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO only.

Star3:

apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15 pc.

Wait, this is confusing. If the apparent V is given, but also E(B-V), then perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed. But in that case, what's the point of providing E(B-V)?

Wait, perhaps the given V magnitude is the intrinsic, and extinction is to be applied.

Wait, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, and the apparent V is actually the absolute magnitude. Let me see.

Star3's data: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc."

Hmm, perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed, so m_observed=15.5, which is the V we see. But then, what's the point of E(B-V)? Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is (B-V)_observed - (B-V)_intrinsic. But without knowing the intrinsic color, we can't compute it. Alternatively, perhaps the E(B-V) is given to compute the extinction, but the apparent magnitude is already given. So in that case, perhaps the extinction is not needed for this star, or perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic.

Wait, perhaps the apparent V in the question is the absolute V magnitude, but that can't be. Because absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let's proceed with the initial approach.

Assuming that for Star3, the given apparent V is without extinction, and we need to add A_V.

So m_intrinsic = 15.5.

A_V =3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So 17.36 is beyond ESPRESSO's 17 mag limit. So Star3 can't be detected by either spectrograph.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude is given as the observed, which already includes extinction. So in that case, the A_V would be 3.1 *0.6=1.86, but then how does that affect the apparent magnitude? It's already included.

But that doesn't make sense because the apparent magnitude is the observed. So if the star has E(B-V)=0.6, that implies that it's reddened, so the observed V is higher than the intrinsic.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'apparent V magnitude' given is the intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed m.

Wait, let me think again. Let me read the problem statement:

Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and the extinction is A_V.

Wait, but if the star is at 15 pc from us, and the apparent magnitude is 15.5, then that's the m_intrinsic, before extinction.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude as observed from Earth would already include any extinction. So if the question gives the apparent magnitude as 15.5, but the star is affected by extinction (E(B-V)=0.6), that would mean that the star's actual brightness is higher. So the apparent magnitude as observed would be lower than the intrinsic. Wait, no. No, extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher m) and redder.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, so it's 15.5. But then, the E(B-V)=0.6 is provided, which would affect the calculation of other things, like the star's luminosity or color. But for our purpose, the apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction, so Star3's m is 15.5.

So in that case, for Star3:

m_observed=15.5.

So for both spectrographs, 15.5 is ≤17 and ≤16. So it can be detected by both. Wait, but that would mean Star3 is a candidate.

But wait, the problem says that the 'apparent V magnitude' is 15.5, but then provides E(B-V). That suggests that perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed m.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's phrasing is that the apparent V magnitude is the observed, and the E(B-V) is provided for other calculations, but not needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed, considering that for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, so it can be detected by both.

Wait, but then why is the E(B-V) given? Maybe it's a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we need to compute the observed.

So m_intrinsic =15.5.

A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above ESPRESSO's 17 limit. So Star3's observed V is 17.36, which is too faint for ESPRESSO. So it can't be detected by either.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed, so for Star3, m=15.5. Then, E(B-V) is given but not needed for the apparent magnitude calculation. Because the apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. So in that case, Star3's m=15.5, which is acceptable for both.

But that would mean that Star3 can be detected by both. But according to the options, Star3 is in option C (Star2 and Star3) and option B (Star3 and Star5).

But earlier, Star2's m is 16.5, which is beyond HIRES's limit.

Wait, let me proceed to Star4:

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, d=10 pc.

So M=15.5, d=10 pc.

Compute m_intrinsic: M +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5.

A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24.

Thus, m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

16.74 is higher than HIRES's limit (16), so Star4's observed m is 16.74.

So ESPRESSO can detect it (16.74 ≤17), but HIRES can't (16.74>16). So Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V=16.5, d=5 pc.

Compute m_intrinsic: M=16.5, d=5.

m_intrinsic =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

Log10(5)=0.69897.

5 *0.69897 ≈3.495.

So m_intrinsic=16.5 +3.495 -5=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 ≈15.0.

No extinction mentioned, so A_V=0.

So m_observed=15.0.

Which is ≤16 and ≤17. So detectable by both spectrographs.

So, now let me summarize each star's m_observed:

Star1: 15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2:16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: If m_observed is 15.5 (given as apparent, without considering E(B-V)), then yes. But if the given 15.5 is the intrinsic, and we have to add A_V=1.86, then it's 17.36→ no.

Star4: m_observed=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m_observed=15.0 → detectable by both.

Wait, but how to resolve Star3's m_observed? The confusion is whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not.

The question states: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the extinction-corrected magnitude, so the observed is m = apparent + A_V.

Wait, perhaps, no. Because if that were the case, the observed m would be higher than the given.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (so includes extinction), and the E(B-V) is provided for other purposes. In that case, Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is okay for both.

But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

The question says that Star3 has "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So the apparent magnitude is 15.5. So if the apparent magnitude includes extinction, then the E(B-V) is provided but not needed for our calculation. Because we're only concerned with the apparent magnitude.

In that case, Star3's m=15.5, which is acceptable for both.

So, in that scenario, which stars can be detected by both? Let's list:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So which options include any two of these?

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is beyond HIRES (16). So only ESPRESSO can detect Star4. Star5 is detectable by both. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both. So this option would be correct if both are detectable.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5 (detectable by ESPRESSO only), Star3's m=15.5 (detectable by both). So in this case, Star2 cannot be detected by both, so C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, Star4 can be detected only by ESPRESSO. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about Star3. If Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the E(B-V)=0.6, which implies A_V=1.86, then the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3's m_observed=17.36, which is above ESPRESSO's limit (17). So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Then, the only stars that can be detected by both spectrographs are Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but according to the options, there's no option with Star1 and Star5. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, Star5's m=15 → only Star5 is detectable by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m=17.36, Star5=15 → only Star5 is detectable by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2=16.5 (detectable only by ESPRESSO), Star3=17.36 (not detectable).

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1=15.5 (detectable by both), Star4=16.74 (detectable only by ESPRESSO).

Wait, but I thought Star1 is detectable by both, and Star5 is also detectable by both. So which option includes both? The options are:

Looking back at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 not both, Star5 yes.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 no, Star5 yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → neither can be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 yes, Star4 no.

Wait, so according to this, the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options, none have both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star5's m.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=5, log10(5)=0.69897.

m_intrinsic=16.5 +5*(0.69897) -5.

Calculate 5*(0.69897)=3.49485.

So 16.5 +3.49485=19.99485. Then subtract 5: 14.99485≈15.0.

So m_intrinsic=15.0. No extinction, so m_observed=15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0 → detectable by both.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5) and Star5 (15.0).

But looking at the options, none of the options pair Star1 and Star5. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74 → only Star5 is detectable by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m=17.36 → only Star5.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Neither.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is okay, Star4 not.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the star's distance is 15 pc. Wait, no, the apparent magnitude depends on the star's absolute magnitude and distance, but if the apparent magnitude is already given, that calculation isn't needed.

Wait, perhaps Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the distance and M are irrelevant. So regardless of distance, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is acceptable for both. But that would mean that Star3's E(B-V) is irrelevant, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the absolute magnitude, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for Star3 and Star4, the given apparent magnitude isn't the observed but is the intrinsic, and we need to compute the observed m.

Let me recheck the problem statement:

The question lists each star with attributes:

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10. So we can compute.

Star2: apparent V=16.5, d=5. So apparent is given.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15.

Star4: Mv=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, d=10.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5.

So for Star3, the apparent V is given as 15.5. So m_observed=15.5. But since the star has E(B-V)=0.6, does that affect the apparent magnitude? No, because the apparent magnitude already includes extinction.

Wait, but then why is E(B-V) given? Perhaps it's for another purpose, like calculating the star's luminosity or other properties, but for our problem, we only need the apparent magnitude.

In that case, Star3's m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Similarly, Star4 has Mv=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute m_intrinsic: M +5 log10(d) -5 =15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5.

A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Which is above HIRES's limit (16). So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5.

m_intrinsic=16.5 +5 log10(5) -5 =16.5 +3.495 -5=14.995≈15.0.

No extinction, so m_observed=15.0. Detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

Looking at the options:

Which options include any two of these?

Looking at the options:

Option B) Star3 and Star5: both are detectable → correct.

Option D) Star1 and Star4: Star1 is yes, Star4 is no.

Option A) Star4 and Star5: only Star5.

Option C) Star2 and Star3: Star2 is no, Star3 is yes.

So the correct answer should be option B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought Star3's m_observed is 17.36 if the given apparent is intrinsic. But if the given apparent is observed, then Star3's m=15.5.

So the confusion is whether the given apparent magnitude for Star3 includes extinction or not.

I think the key here is that the question provides apparent magnitude as the observed value, which already includes extinction. So for Star3, m=15.5. Therefore, Star3 is detectable by both.

Thus, the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes two of these is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4). So according to this, option B is correct.

But wait, the options don't have an option with Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in understanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star, considering their absolute magnitude, distance, and any extinction.

So:

Star1:

M=15.5, d=10.

m_intrinsic =15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5.

No extinction. m_observed=15.5.

Star2:

m_observed=16.5.

Star3:

M= ?, d=15.

Wait, the question says Star3 has apparent V=15.5. So that's already m_observed, including extinction. So no need to compute.

Star4:

M=15.5, d=10.

m_intrinsic=15.5 +5(1)-5=15.5.

A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Star5:

M=16.5, d=5.

m_intrinsic=16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

5 * 0.69897≈3.49485.

m_intrinsic=16.5 +3.49485 -5=14.99485≈15.0.

No extinction. m_observed=15.0.

So, the stars detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

Which options include two of them?

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → yes.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction.  
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \cdot 1 - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
  Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( 15.5 \leq 16 \) and \( 15.5 \leq 17 \). Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**  
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (irrelevant since \( m \) is given).  
- **Conclusion**: \( 16.5 > 16 \). Detectable only by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star3**  
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).  
- **Key Note**: The apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) is already the observed magnitude, which includes extinction.  
- **Conclusion**: \( 15.5 \leq 16 \) and \( 15.5 \leq 17 \). Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star4**  
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \cdot 1 - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( 16.74 > 16 \). Detectable only by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star5**  
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction.  
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(5) - 5
  \]  
  \[
  \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 \cdot \log_{10}(5) \approx 3.49485
  \]  
  \[
  m_{\text{intrinsic}} = 16.5 + 3.49485 - 5 = 15.0
  \]  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} = 15.0 \quad (\text{no extinction})
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( 15.0 \leq 16 \) and \( 15.0 \leq 17 \). Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Determination:
- **Stars detectable by both spectrographs**: Star1 (\( m = 15.5 \)), Star3 (\( m = 15.5 \)), and Star5 (\( m = 15.0 \)).
- **Options Analysis**:  
  - **A) Star4 and Star5**: Star4 (\( m = 16.74 \)) is not detectable by HIRES.  
  - **B) Star3 and Star5**: Both are detectable by both spectrographs.  
  - **C) Star2 and Star3**: Star2 (\( m = 16.5 \)) is not detectable by HIRES.  
  - **D) Star1 and Star4**: Star4 (\( m = 16.74 \)) is not detectable by HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B) Star3 and Star5**.
