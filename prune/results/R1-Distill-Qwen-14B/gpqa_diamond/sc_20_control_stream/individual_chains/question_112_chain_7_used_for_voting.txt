Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

Alright, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I guess I need to normalize this state because right now it's just proportional, not normalized. Normalizing means finding the coefficient so that the sum of the probabilities is 1.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. The normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the magnitudes squared of each coefficient. So the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly, (2 - i): magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but wait, the question says it's proportional, so yes, we need to normalize.

Next, the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So in matrix form, it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. Since |up> and |down> are the basis vectors, the operator A would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are 0.

Wait, but the operator is being measured, and we're to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. Oh wait, no. Wait, the operator's eigenstates are the states into which the system can collapse upon measurement. So the operator's eigenstates are the basis for expressing |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So first, perhaps I should find the eigenstates of the operator A.

But let's think: the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. Hmm, I think this resembles the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So perhaps the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

The eigenstates of X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? So these would be the eigenstates of A.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of A using the given state. But wait, the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. So each eigenstate has a certain probability, and then the average value would be the sum over eigenvalues times their probabilities.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the average value of A directly, using the state |alpha>. Because the average value is <alpha| A |alpha>. But for the probabilities, perhaps I have to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Let me think step by step.

Step 1: Normalize |alpha>.
As I calculated earlier, |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Step 2: Find the eigenstates of operator A.

Operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Its eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λ I) =0.

So the matrix is:

[ -λ, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -λ ]

Determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) =0 → λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) |v> = 0

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to two equations:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + (hbar/2) I) |v> =0 → [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ; hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

Which gives v1 = -v2. So eigenvectors are (1, -1).

But since we can choose the normalization, the eigenvectors are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2). So these are the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but in our problem, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-component of spin (S_z). The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the x-component of spin (S_x), right? Because the Pauli matrices correspond to the spin operators. So the eigenstates of A are the spin-up and spin-down in the x-direction.

So to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, I need to expand |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

Once I find c_+ and c_-, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner products.

So let's compute c_+ = < +x | alpha >, and c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Compute c_+:

< +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So,

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) 

Wait, that's because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms would be <up|down> =0.

Wait:

Wait, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up | alpha> + <down | alpha> ]

But, <up | alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down | alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

So,

c_+ = (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

The probability is |c_+|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈0.642857.

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up | alpha> - <down | alpha> ]

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Compute numerator inside: (1+i -2 +i )= (-1 + 2i )

So,

c_- = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) 

The probability is |c_-|^2 = (1^2 + (2)^2 ) / (2*7) ) = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, wait wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, the numerator is (-1 + 2i), so when you take the magnitude squared, ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2 =5/(2*7) )=5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36 for the probabilities. But I'm not sure about the average value yet.

Wait, the average value of the operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the average value can be found as the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and their probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 respectively.

So the average <A> would be (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) ) = [9*(hbar/2) -5*(hbar/2)] /14

Which simplifies to [ (9 -5) * hbar/2 ] /14 → (4 * hbar/2 ) /14 → (2 hbar) /14 → hbar /7.

So the average is hbar/7. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, what's the average another way? Let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed as a vector, |alpha> is (a, b), where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So, A |alpha> is ( (b)*hbar/2, a * hbar/2 )

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is a*(b hbar/2) + b*(a hbar/2 )

Wait, no, because <alpha| is the conjugate transpose, which is [a*, b*], so:

<alpha| A |alpha> = a* * (b hbar/2 ) + b* * (a hbar/2 )

= (a* b + b* a ) * hbar/2

Now compute a* and b*:

a = (1 +i)/sqrt(7) → a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

So, a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 (since i² is -1) → (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7 → 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i → 2 +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So a* b + b* a = (1-3i) + (1+3i) ) = 2.

So <A> is (2) * hbar/2 = hbar.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation of hbar/7. Hmm, that's a problem. So which one is correct?

Wait, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me recheck.

The first method using eigenvalues and probabilities: The probability for +hbar/2 is 9/14, for -hbar/2 is 5/14. So average is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) = [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2) = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2)= hbar/7.

But the direct calculation gives <A> = hbar.

Hmm, that's a big discrepancy. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me recompute the direct calculation.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

alpha is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So A |alpha> is:

First component: 0*a + (hbar/2)*b → (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
Second component: (hbar/2)*a + 0*b → (hbar/2)*(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

So <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of alpha times A alpha.

Which is:

alpha* · A alpha = ( (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) · ( (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) )

Dot product:

= [ (1-i)(hbar/2)(2 -i) + (2+i)(hbar/2)(1 +i) ] / (7)

Factor out (hbar/2)/7:

→ (hbar/2) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] /7

Compute each term:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² → 2-3i -1 → 1 -3i.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i² → 2+3i -1 →1 +3i.

Adding these: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the whole expression is (hbar/2)(2) /7 → (hbar/2 * 2)/7 → hbar /7.

Ah, I see where I made a mistake earlier. I think I missed the division by 7 in my initial direct calculation. So the correct average is hbar/7. So the first method was correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So that's our answer.

Wait, but wait, another alternative approach: perhaps the operator A is not the spin-x operator but scaled differently. Let me double-check the operator matrix. A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. So, as I wrote earlier, it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2, which is correct.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the magnitudes squared of the coefficients:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = \sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2} = \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the \( X \)-spin operator. These eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are calculated as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right),
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]

Substituting \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i + 2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the magnitudes squared of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the eigenvalue decomposition, \( \langle A \rangle \) is also expressed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
