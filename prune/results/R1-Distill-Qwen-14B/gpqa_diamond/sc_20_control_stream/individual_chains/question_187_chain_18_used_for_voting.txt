Alright, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each of the stars a) to f), whether they meet this criterion.

First, I should probably recall what ESPRESSO is capable of. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Chile. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method, so it's good at measuring Doppler shifts, which means it can detect stars with high signal clarity.

I think the key here is the S/N ratio. The S/N depends on the brightness of the star, which in turn depends on its distance and intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude). Wait, the absolute magnitude is given for options c, d, e, f, so I can use that.

Wait, no, the absolute magnitude is a measure of the star's intrinsic brightness. But what matters for apparent brightness is the distance. So the apparent magnitude would be V = V_abs + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, the formula is V = V_abs + 5 log10(d) - 5. Right, because the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), so M is absolute magnitude, m is apparent. So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude.

But wait, how does the apparent magnitude relate to the S/N? Because a lower apparent magnitude (brighter) means more photons, which would increase the S/N.

I remember that the S/N ratio for a star observed with a spectrograph depends on the number of photons received. The higher the photon count, the higher the S/N. So for a given exposure time, a brighter star (lower m) would have a higher S/N.

ESPRESSO's performance is probably characterized by what's called the S/N per pixel for a certain magnitude. I think I've heard that ESPRESSO can achieve around 100 S/N per pixel for a V=0 star in an hour, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps for a V=10 star, you get S/N of about 10 per pixel after an hour. Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula or a way to calculate S/N based on the star's magnitude. I think the formula involves the number of photons received. Let me think: the number of photons per second from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)), where m0 is some reference magnitude, like m=0 for a star that emits 3.64e-9 erg/cm²/s/Å. Or something like that.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I remember that the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the square root of the number of photons. But exposure time is fixed here (1 hour), so it's all about the brightness.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the ESPRESSO's design parameters. Since I can't actually look at the link, I'll try to remember. ESPRESSO is a very high-resolution spectrograph (like resolving power R ~ 140,000) but with a relatively small slit or fiber, so the amount of light it can gather per pixel is limited. But I think it's designed to reach S/N levels of 10 per pixel for stars down to a certain magnitude, say around V=20 or maybe even fainter, depending on the exposure time.

Wait, but the question is about whether the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel. So for a 1-hour exposure, what magnitude can ESPRESSO achieve an S/N of 10?

I think ESPRESSO's performance is such that it can obtain S/N ratios of 10 per pixel in a few minutes for bright stars, but for fainter stars, you need longer exposures. Wait, but during 1 hour, perhaps it can achieve 10 S/N for stars up to a certain apparent magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the V magnitude of the star determines the photon flux. Let's think in terms of photon flux.

The formula for photon flux from a star is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)), where F0 is the flux from a star with magnitude m0. Let's take m0 as 0 for simplicity. So F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m). 

The number of photons per second is then F multiplied by the effective area of the telescope and the quantum efficiency of the detector. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers here.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a V=10 star, the photon flux is about 1e-9 erg/cm²/s/Å. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I can find an approximate way. Let's think about the S/N formula. The S/N per pixel is proportional to sqrt(N_photons), where N_photons is the number of photons collected in the exposure time. So for a 1-hour exposure (3600 seconds), N_photons = F * A * QE * t, where F is the photon flux, A is the telescope area, QE is quantum efficiency, and t is time.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps I can reason about the faintest magnitude ESPRESSO can handle.

Wait, according to some sources, ESPRESSO is designed to reach S/N ratios of about 100 per pixel for V=10 stars in an hour. Wait, that would mean that for brighter stars, S/N is higher. So if a star is brighter (lower m), you get higher S/N. So for a star with m=15, would the S/N be 10?

Wait, let me think. If m=10 gives S/N=100, then each magnitude step (which is a factor of ~2.5 in brightness) would change the S/N by a factor of sqrt(2.5) ~ 1.58. So for each magnitude brighter (lower m), S/N increases by 1.58 times. For each magnitude fainter, it decreases by that factor.

Wait, but wait. The S/N scales with the square root of the flux. So the flux is 10^(-0.4 * (m - m_ref)), where m_ref is the reference magnitude. So for a star with m = m_ref + x, the flux is 10^(-0.4 x) times the reference flux. Then the S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux * t), so scaling as sqrt(10^(-0.4 x) * t).

Wait, so if for m_ref, S/N is S0. Then for m = m_ref + x, S/N is S0 * sqrt(10^(-0.4 x)) = S0 * (10^(-0.2 x)).

But I'm not sure what m_ref is. Let's assume that for a V=15 star, the S/N is S. If for m=10 S is 100, then for m=15, which is 5 magnitudes fainter, the S/N would be 100 * (10^(-0.2 *5 )) = 100 * 10^(-1) = 10. So a V=15 star would have S/N of 10 per pixel. 

Wait, that's exactly what the question is asking for. So any star with apparent magnitude V=15 or brighter (lower m) would have S/N >=10.

But wait, no, if m=10 gives S/N=100, then m=15 gives S/N=10. So a star at V=15 would just barely reach the S/N of 10. So for stars fainter than V=15, the S/N would be lower than 10.

So now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star, and see whether it's <=15 (since lower m is brighter).

Wait, but wait, no. Let's clarify: lower apparent magnitude means brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is ≤15, then its S/N would be ≥10. 

Wait, no. Because m=10 has higher S/N than m=15. So the stars with m ≤15 would have S/N ≥10.

So the question now is: for each star, compute their apparent V magnitude and see if it's ≤15.

Let's go through each option:

a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, so way below 15. So yes, it's detectable.

b) Polaris. Polaris is a variable star, but I think its apparent magnitude is around 2. So yes, definitely brighter than 15, so yes.

c) Star with V_abs=15, 10 pc away. Let's compute its apparent magnitude.

Apparent magnitude m = V_abs + 5 log10(d) -5.

d is 10 pc, so log10(10)=1. So m = 15 +5*1 -5 = 15. So m=15. So S/N is exactly 10. So yes, detectable.

d) Star with V_abs=15, 200 pc. Compute m.

m =15 +5*log10(200) -5.

Wait, log10(200) is approx 2.3010. So 5 * 2.3010=11.505. So m=15 +11.505 -5 = 15 +6.505=21.505. So m ~21.5, which is way fainter than 15. So S/N would be much less than 10. So not detectable.

e) Star with V_abs=15, 5 pc. m=15 +5*log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897. 5 *0.69897≈3.495. So m=15 +3.495 -5=13.495. So m≈13.5. Which is brighter than 15, so S/N would be higher than 10. So yes, detectable.

f) Star with V_abs=15, 50 pc. m=15 +5*log10(50) -5.

log10(50)=1.69897. 5*1.69897≈8.495. So m=15+8.495-5=18.495. So m≈18.5, which is fainter than 15. So S/N <10. Not detectable.

Wait, so let's list all the stars and their detectability:

a) Canopus: m ≈-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: m≈2 → yes.

c) 10 pc: m=15 → yes.

d) 200 pc: m≈21.5 → no.

e) 5 pc: m≈13.5 → yes.

f) 50 pc: m≈18.5 → no.

So the stars that are detectable are a, b, c, e. That's 4 stars.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for each.

Canopus: Yes, it's a very bright star, so definitely detectable.

Polaris: Same reasoning, it's a bright star with m~2, so yes.

Star c: 10 pc. So m=15 → exactly the limit. So S/N=10, which meets the requirement. So yes.

Star e: 5 pc. V_abs=15. So m=15 +5*(log10(5)) -5 → log10(5)=0.69897. 5*0.69897=3.4949. So 15+3.4949=18.4949 minus 5 → 13.4949. So m≈13.5. That's brighter than 15, so S/N higher than 10.

So the four stars that are detectable are a, b, c, e.

Wait, but wait, looking again at the options:

The options are a to f. So the detectable ones are a, b, c, e. That's four stars.

Wait, but the multiple-choice options are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

So the correct answer would be C)4.

To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude \( m \) of the star, as the S/N ratio scales with the photon flux, which is inversely related to the apparent magnitude. 

### Key Formula
The apparent magnitude \( m \) of a star can be calculated using the relation:
\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]
where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a star to be detectable, its apparent magnitude must satisfy \( m \leq 15 \), as this corresponds to an S/N ratio of at least 10 per binned pixel.

### Analysis of Each Star
1. **Canopus (a)**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This is much brighter than \( m = 15 \), so it is detectable.

2. **Polaris (b)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2 \), which is also much brighter than \( m = 15 \). It is detectable.

3. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c)**: 
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15
   \]
   The apparent magnitude is exactly \( m = 15 \), so it is detectable.

4. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \) (d)**:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 \approx 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505
   \]
   The apparent magnitude is \( m \approx 21.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). It is not detectable.

5. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e)**:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495
   \]
   The apparent magnitude is \( m \approx 13.5 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). It is detectable.

6. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \) (f)**:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 \approx 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495
   \]
   The apparent magnitude is \( m \approx 18.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). It is not detectable.

### Conclusion
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), the star at \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c), and the star at \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e). This gives a total of **4 detectable stars**.
