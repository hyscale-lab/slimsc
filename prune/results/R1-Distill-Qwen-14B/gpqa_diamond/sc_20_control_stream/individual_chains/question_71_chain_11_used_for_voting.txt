Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see. It's about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are five exoplanets, all with circular orbits and discovered via the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has a period of, say, P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, etc. Wait, no—wait, the ratios are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5. So each subsequent planet's period is that multiple of the first one's period.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Same albedo, so that factor is out of the equation, which probably means we don't have to worry about the albedo affecting the temperature ratio.

Equilibrium temperature—right, the formula for that is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, maybe it's more precise to think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_earth * (L / (16πσ a² D²))^(1/4) ), but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, another way I remember is that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to the square root of (L/(16πσ a²)), considering the planet emits as a blackbody. But perhaps a simpler approach is to use the formula that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, assuming same star properties.

But in this problem, the planets are all around the same star, right? Because it's a system of five exoplanets. So the star's L, R, etc., are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital distance a.

Wait, but how do orbital periods relate to a? Oh, Kepler's third law! The law says that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). Specifically, P² ∝ a³, with the proportionality depending on the mass of the star and the gravitational constant. But since all planets are around the same star, we can say P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a³ = (GM/(4π²)) * P². Therefore, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, so if a is proportional to P^(2/3), then the ratio of a for Planet_4 to Planet_2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Let me see, P4 is 3.5 times P1, P2 is 2 times P1. So P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let's compute that. 1.75 is the same as 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, what's that approximately? Let's see:

First, 7/4 is 1.75. So taking cube root first: 1.75^(1/3) is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75). Then square that: (1.2)^2 = 1.44. So a4 is about 1.44 times a2.

But the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a. So T = T_earth * (a_earth / a)^(1/2), or more generally, T ∝ 1/√a.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is T = T_star × (R_star/(2a))^(1/2), assuming the planet is a perfect blackbody. So if a is larger, the temperature is lower. So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be sqrt(a2 / a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (a2) / (1.44 a2) ) ) ?

Wait no, wait. Let me rephrase. Because a4 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) * a2. Wait, no, wait: the a's are proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = (P4 / P1)^(2/3) * a1, but a2 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3) * a1. So a4 / a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

So a4 = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3). So a4 is 1.44 a2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, wait, if a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a4 is (3.5)^(2/3) times a1, and a2 is (2)^(2/3) times a1. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.44. So a4 is larger than a2 by a factor of approximately 1.44. So a4 = 1.44 a2.

Wait, but wait, for Kepler's law, P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a³ = (GM/(4π²)) P². So a ∝ P^(2/3). So yes, a4 is 3.5^(2/3) times a1, and a2 is 2^(2/3) times a1. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3). Let me compute that more accurately. 7/4 is 1.75.

So 1.75^(2/3). Let me compute 1.75^ (1/3) first. Cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So 1.2^3 = 1.728. So 1.75^(1/3) is a little more than 1.2—maybe about 1.205. Then square that: 1.205^2 ≈ 1.452. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

So a4 is about 1.452 times a2. Therefore, the distance of planet 4 is larger than planet 2.

Now, equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * (sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4)) ) = T2 * sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

So a2/a4 = 1 / 1.452 ≈ 0.6875.

Wait, because a4 = 1.452 a2, so a2/a4 is 1/1.452 ≈ 0.6875.

So T4/T2 = sqrt(0.6875) ≈ ?

Compute sqrt(0.6875). Hmm, 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is very close to 0.6875. Oh wait, 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is a little larger than 0.6875. So sqrt(0.6875) is approximately 0.829. Wait, but 0.83^2 is 0.6889, so 0.829^2 is about 0.6875.

Wait, 0.829 squared: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, 0.029^2 is negligible, but cross terms: 2 * 0.8 * 0.029 = 0.0464. So 0.64 + 0.0464 = 0.6864, which is a bit less than 0.6875. Hmm, so maybe 0.829 is a bit low. Let me think another way. Let me compute 0.829^2:

0.829 * 0.829

= (0.8 + 0.029)^2

= 0.8^2 + 2*(0.8)*(0.029) + 0.029^2

= 0.64 + 2 * 0.0232 + 0.000841

= 0.64 + 0.0464 + 0.000841 ≈ 0.687241.

Ah, that's very close to 0.6875. So sqrt(0.6875) is about 0.829... So approximately 0.829.

So T4 is about 0.829 times T2. So the ratio is T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio.

Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 is (a2/(a4))^(1/2) * T2.

Wait, no: T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * (a2 / a4)^(1/2). So if a4 is larger, T4 is smaller. So the ratio is (a2/a4)^(1/2). So the ratio is sqrt(1/(1.452)) = sqrt(0.6875) ≈ 0.829. So T4 is 0.829 times T2.

So the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the planets' orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\), where \(P\) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Approximating \(1.75^{1/3} \approx 1.2\) (since \(1.2^3 = 1.728\)), squaring this gives:

\[
1.75^{2/3} \approx 1.44.
\]

Thus, \(a_4 \approx 1.44 a_2\).

The equilibrium temperature \(T\) is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{a}\), so the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.44}} = \sqrt{0.6875}.
\]

Approximating \(\sqrt{0.6875}\), we find:

\[
\sqrt{0.6875} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.

So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be sqrt(a2 / a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (a2) / (1.44 a2) ) ) ?

Wait no, wait. Let me rephrase. Because a4 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) * a2. Wait, no, wait: the a's are proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = (P4 / P1)^(2/3) * a1, but a2 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3) * a1. So a4 / a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

So a4 = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3). So a4 is 1.44 a2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, wait, if a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a4 is (3.5)^(2/3) times a1, and a2 is (2)^(2/3) times a1.

So a4 is about 1.452 times a2. Therefore, the distance of planet 4 is larger than planet 2.

Now, equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * (sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4)) ) = T2 * sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

So a2/a4 = 1 / 1.452 ≈ 0.6875.

Wait, because a4 = 1.452 a2, so a2/a4 is 1/1.452 ≈ 0.6875.

So T4/T2 = sqrt(0.6875) ≈ ?

Compute sqrt(0.6875). Hmm, 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is very close to 0.6875. Oh wait, 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is a little larger than 0.6875. So sqrt(0.6875) is approximately 0.829. Wait, but 0.83^2 is 0.6889, so 0.829^2 is about 0.6875.
