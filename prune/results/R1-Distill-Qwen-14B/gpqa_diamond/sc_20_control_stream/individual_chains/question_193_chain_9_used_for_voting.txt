Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax (plx). So if plx is in parsecs, then distance is also in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance = 1/plx. 

Wait, but the problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, where d is distance, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (1/(1/d))^5, which is d^5. Wait, let's see: 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So are they asking for the differential number, like dN/dr? Because if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of stars as a function of distance. The number of stars per unit volume, maybe? Oh wait, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, that's N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with d^5. But wait, that seems a bit odd because I thought the number of stars in a region depends on the volume, which is proportional to d^3. But maybe in this problem, it's different.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the number density with the total number. Let me clarify. Suppose you have a method of detecting stars where the number you observe depends on their brightness, and brightness relates to distance via the inverse square law. But the question is about how the number varies with parallax, so it's given as 1/plx^5.

Wait, let's think about how the number of stars relates to distance. When you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are. But the question states that the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a proportionality constant.

Since plx is 1/d, N = k * d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So per unit increase in r (distance), how does N change? That's the derivative, dN/dr.

Calculating dN/dr: since N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are about how the number changes with distance (per unit range). So perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars per unit volume, or how the density changes. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr at distance d, which would be proportional to 4πd² * (number density) * dr. 

Wait, maybe I should model the number of stars as a function of distance. Let's consider that the number of stars in a small volume element at distance d would depend on the density of stars and the volume of that element. If the number density (stars per unit volume) is N(d), then the total number in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately N(d) * 4π d² dr. But if N(d) varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, then the number in the shell would be proportional to d^5 * d² dr = d^7 dr. That seems way too high, but let's think again.

Wait, the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars N increases as d^5. Now, if we are looking at the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec), then dN/dr is the rate of change of N with r. Since N = k r^5 (where r is distance), dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but why is the number of stars increasing so rapidly with distance? That seems counterintuitive because usually, the number of stars you can see increases with volume, which is r^3. But here, the given relation is 1/plx^5, which is d^5, so the number in the volume would be increasing more steeply. But perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a fixed region of the sky, which would be a thin shell. Hmm, but that might not align.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N ∝ d^5. Then, dN/dr is proportional to d^4. So the rate at which the number of stars increases per unit distance is proportional to d^4, which is option C (~r^4). So the answer would be C.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely related to distance (\(d\)) as \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\(r\)). This requires calculating the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\), which is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \(r^4\). Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.
