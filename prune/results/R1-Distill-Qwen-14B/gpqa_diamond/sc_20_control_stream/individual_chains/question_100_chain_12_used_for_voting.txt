Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what each part is doing.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Since the next step is bromination in the presence of CCl4, that's likely an addition reaction, not substitution. So propene makes sense because cyclopropane would probably undergo different reactions, maybe ring-opening. So propene is CH2=CH2CH3, wait no, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. But wait, wait, C3H6 is also cyclopropane, but I think the more common starting point for bromination is propene.

So, when propene (CH2=CH2CH3) undergoes bromination in CCl4, it's probably an addition reaction. So it would add Br2 across the double bond. The product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond. So propene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br to each end of the double bond. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Or wait, no, because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, adding Br2 would result in CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, right? So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, when compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So this is probably an elimination reaction. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and reacting with alcoholic KOH would cause elimination. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent bromines. When you eliminate, you usually remove two substituents (leaving groups) and form a double bond. So for each Br, we can lose HBr. So two HBr molecules would be lost, and the double bond would form. Wait, but wait: 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. So when eliminating, we can lose Br from C1 and H from C2, or vice versa. So the product C would be propene again? Wait, no. Wait, if you eliminate both Brs, you'd get back propene. That can't be right because that would be the same as the starting material. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, which would produce a triple bond? Or perhaps I messed up the initial structure.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add to each carbon of the double bond, giving CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait a second. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. Oh right, because each of the double-bond carbons gets a Br. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the propene structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would undergo elimination. So the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, which is a vicinal dihalide. Elimination would likely form an alkene. Wait, but if we have two Brs on adjacent carbons, eliminating two molecules of HBr would form a triple bond? Or perhaps a double bond, because if you eliminate two HBr, you go from CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 to CH≡C-CH3? Wait, but wait: elimination of two HBr would require two adjacent Brs. Let me think. When you have a vicinal dihalide, treating with a strong base like alcoholic KOH can lead to dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So each Br is on adjacent C's. So when you eliminate HBr from each, you would form a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product C would be propene again, CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, but wait, if that's the case, that's the starting material. So perhaps there's another possibility. Alternatively, maybe the bromination isn't adding across the double bond but is a substitution. Wait, no, because CCl4 is a solvent for bromination via addition. So I think the product is 1,2-dibromopropane, and upon elimination, it forms propene again. So C is propene.

Then, compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, red-hot iron is used in the production of alkenes from alkanes via dehydrogenation, but wait, propene is an alkene. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe C is propane, but no, because the reaction before with KOH would produce an alkene. Wait, no, C is propene. So heating propene with red-hot iron might cause some reaction. Oh wait, I think when alkenes are passed over a red-hot iron, it can cause dehydrohalogenation but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, converting the alkene into an alkyne. Wait, but propene is an alkene, CH2=CHCH3. Heating with iron might cause dehydrogenation to form propyne, CH≡CH2CH3? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cracking reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, when alkenes are passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's possible that they get hydrogenated, but that's usually with a catalyst like palladium. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't apply here. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. When passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's a dehydration reaction? But propene is already an alkene. Wait, no, perhaps the iron is acting as a catalyst for some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination wasn't adding across the double bond, but maybe substituting. Wait, no, because CCl4 is used for addition reactions, not substitution. So I think the initial reaction is correct, and B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

So compound C is propene again. Then, when passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form an alkyne. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would become propyne (CH≡CCH3), which is compound D. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction. What happens when an alkene is passed over a red-hot iron? Oh, wait, I think that's a common method for dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, but for alkenes, perhaps it's used in some other way. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So propene to propyne. So D is propyne.

Then, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm, two strong acids... Wait, perhaps concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid? That's a common mixture for nitration. So propyne (CH≡CCH3) reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3 would undergo nitration. Where would the nitro group attach? In the case of alkynes, nitration typically occurs at the terminal position because it's more reactive. So E would be nitropropyne: CH≡CCH2NO2? Wait, no, the nitration would add a nitro group to the triple bond. Wait, but for alkynes, nitration usually occurs at the terminal position. So maybe the product is CH2NO2-C≡CH, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are different. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation reaction, but the question mentions two strong acids, which are H2SO4 and HNO3. So yes, nitration.

So E would be nitropropyne: O2N-C≡C-CH3? Wait, the structure would be CH3-C≡C-NO2? Wait, no, because the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the nitro group would attach to the triple bond. So the product would be CH2NO2-C≡CH? Or perhaps CH3-C≡C-NO2? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure here. Let me think: propyne is CH3-C≡CH. When nitrated, the nitro group adds to the triple bond, so it would be CH3-C≡C-NO2. So E is CH3C≡CNO2.

Next, compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Hmm. Iron and HCl usually lead to the formation of FeCl2 and H2. But in the context of E, which is a nitrated alkyne, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, nitrated alkynes can undergo hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So nitro groups can be reduced. Wait, but in the presence of Fe and HCl, which is a reducing condition. So maybe the nitro group is reduced to an amine.

So, E is CH3C≡CNO2. Under acidic conditions with Fe, which is a reducing agent, the nitro group would be reduced. So nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to amine (-NH2). So F would be CH3C≡C-NH2. But wait, reducing an alkyne's nitro group to amine. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated. Wait, but in the presence of Fe and HCl, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane. Wait, but I thought that alkyne hydrogenation typically requires a catalyst like Ni, Pd, etc. Fe might not be a catalyst for that. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced. So F could be CH3CH2CH2NH2, but that doesn't make sense because the alkyne would have to be hydrogenated. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

E is CH3-C≡C-NO2. When treated with Fe and HCl, which is a HCl solution with Fe as a reducing agent. So in acidic conditions, the nitro group might be reduced. The nitro group (-NO2) can be reduced to an amine (-NH2) via this method. So the product F would be CH3-C≡C-NH2, which is a primary amine attached to an alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated as well. But I'm not sure if Fe and HCl would do that; typically, alkyne hydrogenation uses different catalysts. So perhaps F is CH3-C≡C-NH2.

Then, compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is used in the diazotization of aromatic amines, but in this case, F is a primary alkyne amine. Wait, primary aliphatic amines don't typically form diazonium salts under nitrous acid conditions unless they're aromatic. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps F is an aromatic amine. Wait, no, because the starting material is propane. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe E is not a nitrated alkyne. Let me go back. When D is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps D is propane, but no, because C was propene. Wait, perhaps I got D wrong. Let me think again about D.

Wait, C is propene. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's heated in the presence of iron, which can cause dehydrohalogenation, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) becomes propyne (CH≡CCH3). So D is propyne.

Then, D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, then E is the nitro derivative of propyne. So E is CH3-C≡C-NO2.

Then, E is treated with Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl is a reducing environment. The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to an amine (-NH2), so E becomes F: CH3-C≡C-NH2.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid is HNO2. For aromatic amines, this forms diazonium salts, but aliphatic amines don't typically do that. Wait, but primary aliphatic amines can form diazonium salts under certain conditions. So F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. When treated with nitrous acid at low temperatures (like 0-5°C), it would form a diazonium salt. So G would be CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^- (but in the presence of HCl, perhaps it's a chloride).

Wait, but wait, in the presence of HCl, the diazonium salt would form a diazonium chloride. So G is CH3-C≡C-N2Cl.

Then, when G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Diazonium salts in basic conditions typically undergo hydrolysis. The diazo group (-N2-) would be hydrolyzed. For aromatic diazonium salts, this can form a phenol or other structures, but for aliphatic ones, it might form an amine oxide or something else. Wait, but aliphatic diazonium salts are less stable and tend to decompose upon heating or hydrolysis. So perhaps the reaction forms a hydroxylamine or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the reactions wrong. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction sequence is different. Let me try to outline each step clearly.

1. A is C3H6. Structure is propene (CH2=CHCH3).
2. Bromination in CCl4 → addition across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination of HBr → propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. So C is propene.
4. Pass C through red-hot iron → dehydrogenation to form alkyne. So D is propyne (CH≡CCH3).
5. D reacts with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) → nitration. Since D is propyne, nitration would add a nitro group to the triple bond. So E is CH3-C≡C-NO2.
6. E treated with Fe and HCl → reduction of nitro group to amine. So F is CH3-C≡C-NH2.
7. F treated with nitrous acid → diazotization. So G is the diazonium salt: CH3-C≡C-N2+Cl^-.
8. G treated with NaOH → hydrolysis of diazonium salt. For aliphatic diazonium salts, hydrolysis can form an amine oxide or perhaps a hydroxylamine. But I'm not exactly sure about this step. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a ketone or another structure.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial steps. Let me think again about step 4. If compound C is propene (CH2=CHCH3) and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form acetylene (propyne) and water. So D is propyne, as I thought.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. That's an alkyne with an amine group. I'm not sure if that's used for dyes. Alternatively, maybe F is something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of F. If F is CH2=CHCH2NH2, that's a primary amine attached to an alkene, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe F is a different compound.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. H is the product after G reacts with NaOH. If G is the diazonium salt, then H would be the product of its hydrolysis. For aromatic diazonium salts, hydrolysis in presence of H2O and NaOH can form phenols, which would give a color with FeCl3. But for aliphatic diazonium salts, the hydrolysis might form something else, perhaps an aldehyde or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The structure is CH3-C≡C. The protons on CH3 are all equivalent, so they would be a singlet. The alkyne protons (if any) are absent because propyne is CH3-C≡CH, but wait wait, no, no, propyne is CH3-C≡CH, so the alkyne has a CH3 and a CH group. Wait, no, propyne is CH3-C≡C-H? No, wait: propyne is CH3-C≡CH. So the structure is CH3-C≡C-H. So the protons on the CH3 group are three equivalent H's, and the proton on the CH is one H. Wait, but no, wait: CH3-C≡CH has a triple bond between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH3, C2 is C≡C with a CH group. So the H is on the sp-hybridized carbon. So in the NMR, the CH3 group would be a singlet because all three H's are equivalent. The H on the sp carbon would be a triplet? Wait, no, because it's attached to the sp-hybridized carbon, which is connected to another sp-hybridized carbon (the triple bond). So the H would be a singlet as well, because it's only attached to one H, but wait, no. Wait, in CH3-C≡CH, the H on the sp carbon is attached to C≡C-CH3. So the H is on a sp-hybridized C, which is connected to two other sp-hybridized Cs (the triple bond). Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C≡C-H. So the H is on the terminal end of the triple bond. So the H would be a singlet because it's only one H attached to the triple bond. So in the NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet (all three H's), and the H on the triple bond would also be a singlet (since it's only one H). So two singlets. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct if D is propyne. So option C is correct, so the incorrect statement is not C.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene. Propene is a gas, and it's flammable. So D is correct. So the incorrect statement is not D.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is to find the incorrect statement.

So far, I think the incorrect statement is either A or B.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. I'm not sure if this compound is used in dye synthesis. Alternatively, maybe F is something else.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is the product of G (diazonium salt) reacting with NaOH. If G is the diazonium salt of CH3-C≡C- group, then when it's hydrolyzed with NaOH, perhaps it forms CH3-C≡C-OH. Wait, but that's a ketone if the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3-C≡C-OH, which is a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it forms an aldehyde. If the structure is CH3-C≡C-OH, that's a terminal alkyne carboxylic acid, which is not common. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis leads to a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes to form a nitrile. Wait, maybe.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: When an aliphatic diazonium salt is treated with aqueous NaOH, it typically decomposes. For example, the diazonium salt R-N2+Cl^- in aqueous NaOH can undergo hydrolysis to form R-OH (an alcohol) and release N2 gas. So for R being CH3-C≡C-, the product would be CH3-C≡C-OH. But that's a terminal alkyne carboxylic acid, which is not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a ketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of F. Let me re-examine. E is CH3-C≡C-NO2. When reduced with Fe and HCl, the nitro group is converted to an amine group. So F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. Then, treating with nitrous acid (HNO2) would produce a diazonium salt: CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^-.

When this diazonium salt is treated with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis. For aliphatic diazonium salts, hydrolysis can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. So CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^- could hydrolyze to form CH3-C≡C-OH, which would be an alkyne carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes. If the diazonium salt is unstable, it might decompose into an alkyne and nitrogen gas. So, CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^- → CH3-C≡C-H + N2 + Cl^- ?

Wait, but that would give back propyne and release nitrogen and chloride ions. But then H would be propyne. But propyne is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt under basic conditions forms an aldehyde. So perhaps the product H is CH3-C≡C-OH, but that's not a common structure.

Alternatively, maybe when the diazonium salt is treated with NaOH, it undergoes a different reaction, like the formation of a nitrile. But that's not typical.

Hmm, perhaps if the diazonium salt is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can form an aldehyde. Wait, for example, perhaps the reaction is:

R-N2+Cl^- + NaOH → R-OH + N2 + NaCl

So if R is CH3-C≡C-, then R-OH would be CH3-C≡C-OH. But that's a terminal alkyne carboxylic acid, which is not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes to form a ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) is used as a test for phenols. Phenols give a brown color when treated with FeCl3 because the phenol reacts with Fe^3+ to form a complex. So if H is a phenol, then it would give a positive test. But if H is an aldehyde or a ketone, it wouldn't give that color.

So if H is a phenol, then option B is correct. But in our case, H is the product of the diazonium salt's reaction with NaOH. If the initial structure was an aromatic amine, then H would be a phenol, which would give a brown color. But in our case, the amine is aliphatic, so H wouldn't be a phenol. So option B would be incorrect because H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.

But wait, earlier steps might have been wrong. Let me retrace.

Wait, the initial reaction sequence: the first product A is C3H6, which is propene. Then, bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives propene again. Then, dehydrogenation gives propyne. Then, nitration gives nitropropyne. Then, reduction gives aminopropyne. Then, diazotization gives the diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis gives H.

If H is an aldehyde, then it wouldn't react with FeCl3, so option B would be incorrect. So which option is incorrect?

Looking at the options:

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is an aldehyde or ketone, it won't give a yellow color. But if H is a phenol, it would. So in our reaction, H isn't a phenol; it's an aldehyde or something else. So option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first elimination isn't giving propene, but something else. Let me consider that.

Wait, when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, it could undergo elimination to form an alkene. So the product C would be propene. Then, when passed over red-hot iron, perhaps it forms propyne. Then, E is nitropropyne, which when reduced gives aminopropyne. Then, nitrous acid forms the diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis gives a carbonyl group. So H is a carbonyl compound.

So, what is the structure of H? If E is CH3-C≡C-NO2, then F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. G is CH3-C≡C-N2+Cl^-.

When G is treated with NaOH, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes. For example, the reaction could be:

CH3-C≡C-N2+Cl^- + NaOH → CH3-C≡C-OH + N2 + NaCl

So H would be CH3-C≡C-OH, which is an alkyne carboxylic acid. But alkyne carboxylic acids are unstable and tend to tautomerize or undergo other reactions. But regardless, H would be CH3-C≡C-OH.

Now, testing H with FeCl3: FeCl3 reacts with phenols to give a brown color. H is a carboxylic acid, so it wouldn't react with FeCl3. Hence, option B's statement is incorrect. Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps when I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let's recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bromination step. What if the starting compound A is cyclopropane (C3H6) instead of propene? Let me think: cyclopropane is C3H6, and bromination in CCl4 could lead to substitution. But cyclopropane is less reactive towards addition reactions, so perhaps it undergoes substitution. But wait, bromination in CCl4 is usually for addition. So cyclopropane would have three equivalent rings, and bromination would likely add across the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination of cyclopropane would lead to ring opening. For example, bromine could add to the cyclopropane ring, opening it into a diene or a brominated compound. But I'm not certain about that. So perhaps the initial assumption that A is propene is correct.

So, with that, H is CH3-C≡C-OH, which is an alkyne carboxylic acid. It wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B is incorrect.

Looking back at the options, the incorrect statement is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of CCl₄ adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃). Reaction with alcoholic KOH eliminates two molecules of HBr, regenerating propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as compound C. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (CH≡CCH₃), identified as compound D.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃), leading to nitration. The nitro group (-NO₂) adds to the terminal position of the triple bond, forming nitropropyne (CH₃-C≡C-NO₂), identified as compound E. Reduction of E with Fe and HCl converts the nitro group to an amine, yielding aminopropyne (CH₃-C≡C-NH₂), identified as compound F. Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms the diazonium salt (CH₃-C≡C-N₂⁺Cl⁻), identified as compound G. Hydrolysis of G with NaOH produces a carbonyl compound, specifically CH₃-C≡C-OH (an alkyne carboxylic acid), identified as compound H.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: F is CH₃-C≡C-NH₂. While this compound is not commonly associated with dye synthesis, the statement is plausible and does not contradict the reaction sequence.
- **Option B**: H is CH₃-C≡C-OH. This is an alkyne carboxylic acid, which does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color. Phenols, not alkyne carboxylic acids, give a yellow color with FeCl₃. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D is CH₃-C≡C-CH₃ (propyne). In the ¹H NMR spectrum, the CH₃ group produces a singlet (three equivalent protons), and the terminal CH group (on the sp-hybridized carbon) also produces a singlet (one proton). Thus, D gives two singlets, making this statement correct.
- **Option D**: C is CH₂=CHCH₃ (propene). Propene is a flammable gas, making this statement correct.

### Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as H (CH₃-C≡C-OH) does not give a yellow color with FeCl₃. 

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what each part is doing.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Since the next step is bromination in the presence of CCl4, that's likely an addition reaction, not substitution. So propene makes sense because cyclopropane would probably undergo different reactions, maybe ring-opening. So propene is CH2=CH2CH3, wait no, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. But wait, wait, C3H6 is also cyclopropane, but I think the more common starting point for bromination is propene.

So, when propene (CH2=CH2CH3) undergoes bromination in CCl4, it's probably an addition reaction. So it would add Br2 across the double bond. The product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond. So propene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br to each end of the double bond. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Or wait, no, because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, adding Br2 would result in CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, right? So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, when compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So this is probably an elimination reaction. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and reacting with alcoholic KOH would cause elimination. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent bromines. When you eliminate, you usually remove two substituents (leaving groups) and form a double bond. So for each Br, we can lose HBr. So two HBr molecules would be lost, and the double bond would form. Wait, but wait: 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. So when eliminating, we can lose Br from C1 and H from C2, or vice versa. So the product C would be propene again? Wait, no. Wait, if you eliminate both Brs, you'd get back propene. That can't be right because that would be the same as the starting material. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, which would produce a triple bond? Or perhaps I messed up the initial structure.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add to each carbon of the double bond, giving CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait a second. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. Oh right, because each of the double-bond carbons gets a Br. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the propene structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would undergo elimination. So the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, which is a vicinal dihalide. Elimination would likely form an alkene. Wait, but if we have two Brs on adjacent carbons, eliminating two molecules of HBr would form a triple bond? Or perhaps a double bond, because if you eliminate two HBr, you go from CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 to CH≡C-CH3? Wait, but wait: elimination of two HBr would require two adjacent Brs. Let me think. When you have a vicinal dihalide, treating with a strong base like alcoholic KOH can lead to dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So each Br is on adjacent C's. So when you eliminate HBr from each, you would form a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product C would be propene again, CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, but wait, if that's the case, that's the starting material. So perhaps there's another possibility. Alternatively, maybe the bromination isn't adding across the double bond but is a substitution. Wait, no, because CCl4 is a solvent for bromination via addition. So I think the product is 1,2-dibromopropane, and upon elimination, it forms propene again. So C is propene.

Then, compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, red-hot iron is used in the production of alkenes from alkanes via dehydrogenation, but wait, propene is an alkene. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe C is propane, but no, because the reaction before with KOH would produce an alkene. Wait, no, C is propene. So heating propene with red-hot iron might cause some reaction. Oh wait, I think when alkenes are passed over a red-hot iron, it can cause dehydrohalogenation but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, converting the alkene into an alkyne. Wait, but propene is an alkene, CH2=CHCH3. Heating with iron might cause dehydrogenation to form propyne, CH≡CH2CH3? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cracking reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, when alkenes are passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's possible that they get hydrogenated, but that's usually with a catalyst like palladium. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't apply here. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. When passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's a dehydration reaction? But propene is already an alkene. Wait, no, perhaps the iron is acting as a catalyst for some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination wasn't adding across the double bond, but maybe substituting. Wait, no, because CCl4 is used for addition reactions, not substitution. So I think the initial reaction is correct, and B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

So compound C is propene again. Then, when passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form an alkyne. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would become propyne (CH≡CCH3), which is compound D. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction. What happens when an alkene is passed over a red-hot iron? Oh, wait, I think that's a common method for dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, but for alkenes, perhaps it's used in some other way. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So propene to propyne. So D is propyne.

Then, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm, two strong acids... Wait, perhaps concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid? That's a common mixture for nitration. So propyne (CH≡CCH3) reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3 would undergo nitration. Where would the nitro group attach? In the case of alkynes, nitration typically occurs at the terminal position because it's more reactive. So E would be nitropropyne: CH≡CCH2NO2? Wait, no, the nitration would add a nitro group to the triple bond. Wait, but for alkynes, nitration usually occurs at the terminal position. So maybe the product is CH2NO2-C≡CH, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are different. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation reaction, but the question mentions two strong acids, which are H2SO4 and HNO3. So yes, nitration.

So E would be nitropropyne: O2N-C≡C-CH3? Wait, the structure would be CH3-C≡C-NO2? Wait, no, because the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the nitro group would attach to the triple bond. So the product would be CH2NO2-C≡CH? Or perhaps CH3-C≡C-NO2? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure here. Let me think: propyne is CH3-C≡CH. When nitrated, the nitro group adds to the triple bond, so it would be CH3-C≡C-NO2. So E is CH3C≡CNO2.

Next, compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Hmm. Iron and HCl usually lead to the formation of FeCl2 and H2. But in the context of E, which is a nitrated alkyne, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, nitrated alkynes can undergo hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So nitro groups can be reduced. Wait, but in the presence of Fe and HCl, which is a reducing condition. So maybe the nitro group is reduced to an amine.

So, E is CH3C≡CNO2. Under acidic conditions with Fe, which is a reducing agent, the nitro group would be reduced. So nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to amine (-NH2). So F would be CH3C≡C-NH2. But wait, reducing an alkyne's nitro group to amine. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated. Wait, but in the presence of Fe and HCl, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane. Wait, but I thought that alkyne hydrogenation typically requires a catalyst like Ni, Pd, etc. Fe might not be a catalyst for that. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced. So F could be CH3CH2CH2NH2, but that doesn't make sense because the alkyne would have to be hydrogenated. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

E is CH3-C≡C-NO2. When treated with Fe and HCl, which is a HCl solution with Fe as a reducing agent. So in acidic conditions, the nitro group might be reduced. The nitro group (-NO2) can be reduced to an amine (-NH2) via this method. So the product F would be CH3-C≡C-NH2, which is a primary amine attached to an alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated as well. But I'm not sure if Fe and HCl would do that; typically, alkyne hydrogenation uses different catalysts. So perhaps F is CH3-C≡C-NH2.

Then, compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is used in the diazotization of aromatic amines, but in this case, F is a primary alkyne amine. Wait, primary aliphatic amines don't typically form diazonium salts under nitrous acid conditions unless they're aromatic. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps F is an aromatic amine. Wait, no, because the starting material is propane. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe E is not a nitrated alkyne. Let me go back. When D is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps D is propane, but no, because C was propene. Wait, perhaps I got D wrong. Let me think again about D.

Wait, C is propene. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's heated in the presence of iron, which can cause dehydrohalogenation, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) becomes propyne (CH≡CCH3). So D is propyne.

Then, D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, then E is the nitro derivative of propyne. So E is CH3-C≡C-NO2.

Then, E is treated with Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl is a reducing environment. The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to an amine (-NH2), so E becomes F: CH3-C≡C-NH2.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid is HNO2. For aromatic amines, this forms diazonium salts, but aliphatic amines don't typically do that. Wait, but primary aliphatic amines can form diazonium salts under certain conditions. So F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. When treated with nitrous acid at low temperatures (like 0-5°C), it would form a diazonium salt. So G would be CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^- (but in the presence of HCl, perhaps it's a chloride).

Wait, but wait, in the presence of HCl, the diazonium salt would form a diazonium chloride. So G is CH3-C≡C-N2Cl.

Then, when G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Diazonium salts in basic conditions typically undergo hydrolysis. The diazo group (-N2-) would be hydrolyzed. For aromatic diazonium salts, this can form a phenol or other structures, but for aliphatic ones, it might form an amine oxide or something else. Wait, but aliphatic diazonium salts are less stable and tend to decompose upon heating or hydrolysis. So perhaps the reaction forms a hydroxylamine or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the reactions wrong. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction sequence is different. Let me try to outline each step clearly.

1. A is C3H6. Structure is propene (CH2=CHCH3).
2. Bromination in CCl4 → addition across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination of HBr → propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. So C is propene.
4. Pass C through red-hot iron → dehydrogenation to form alkyne. So D is propyne (CH≡CCH3).
5. D reacts with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) → nitration. Since D is propyne, nitration would add a nitro group to the triple bond. So E is CH3-C≡C-NO2.
6. E treated with Fe and HCl → reduction of nitro group to amine. So F is CH3-C≡C-NH2.
7. F treated with nitrous acid → diazotization. So G is the diazonium salt: CH3-C≡C-N2+Cl^-.
8. G treated with NaOH → hydrolysis of diazonium salt. For aliphatic diazonium salts, hydrolysis can form an amine oxide or perhaps a hydroxylamine. But I'm not exactly sure about this step. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a ketone or another structure.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial steps. Let me think again about step 4. If compound C is propene (CH2=CHCH3) and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form acetylene (propyne) and water. So D is propyne, as I thought.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. That's an alkyne with an amine group. I'm not sure if that's used for dyes. Alternatively, maybe F is something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of F. If F is CH2=CHCH2NH2, that's a primary amine attached to an alkene, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe F is a different compound.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. H is the product after G reacts with NaOH. If G is the diazonium salt, then H would be the product of its hydrolysis. For aromatic diazonium salts, hydrolysis in presence of H2O and NaOH can form phenols, which would give a color with FeCl3. But for aliphatic diazonium salts, the hydrolysis might form something else, perhaps an aldehyde or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The structure is CH3-C≡C. The protons on CH3 are all equivalent, so they would be a singlet. The alkyne protons (if any) are absent because propyne is CH3-C≡CH, but wait wait, no, no, propyne is CH3-C≡CH, so the alkyne has a CH3 and a CH group. Wait, no, propyne is CH3-C≡C-H? No, wait: propyne is CH3-C≡CH. So the structure is CH3-C≡C-H. So the protons on the CH3 group are three equivalent H's, and the proton on the CH is one H. Wait, but no, wait: CH3-C≡CH has a triple bond between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH3, C2 is C≡C with a CH group. So the H is on the sp-hybridized carbon. So in the NMR, the CH3 group would be a singlet because all three H's are equivalent. The H on the sp carbon would be a triplet? Wait, no, because it's attached to the sp-hybridized carbon, which is connected to another sp-hybridized carbon (the triple bond). So the H would be a singlet as well, because it's only attached to one H, but wait, no. Wait, in CH3-C≡CH, the H on the sp carbon is attached to C≡C-CH3. So the H is on a sp-hybridized C, which is connected to two other sp-hybridized Cs (the triple bond). Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C≡C-H. So the H is on the terminal end of the triple bond. So the H would be a singlet because it's only one H attached to the triple bond. So in the NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet (all three H's), and the H on the triple bond would also be a singlet (since it's only one H). So two singlets. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct if D is propyne. So option C is correct, so the incorrect statement is not C.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene. Propene is a gas, and it's flammable. So D is correct. So the incorrect statement is not D.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is to find the incorrect statement.

So far, I think the incorrect statement is either A or B.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. I'm not sure if this compound is used in dye synthesis. Alternatively, maybe F is something else.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is the product of G (diazonium salt) reacting with NaOH. If G is the diazonium salt of CH3-C≡C- group, then when it's hydrolyzed with NaOH, perhaps it forms CH3-C≡C-OH. Wait, but that's a ketone if the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3-C≡C-OH, which is a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it forms an aldehyde. If the structure is CH3-C≡C-OH, that's a terminal alkyne carboxylic acid, which is not common. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis leads to a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes to form a nitrile. Wait, maybe.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: When an aliphatic diazonium salt is treated with aqueous NaOH, it typically decomposes. For example, the diazonium salt R-N2+Cl^- in aqueous NaOH can undergo hydrolysis to form R-OH (an alcohol) and release N2 gas. So for R being CH3-C≡C-, the product would be CH3-C≡C-OH. But that's a terminal alkyne carboxylic acid, which is not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a ketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of F. Let me re-examine. E is CH3-C≡C-NO2. When reduced with Fe and HCl, the nitro group is converted to an amine group. So F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. Then, treating with nitrous acid (HNO2) would produce a diazonium salt: CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^-.

When this diazonium salt is treated with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis. For aliphatic diazonium salts, hydrolysis can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. So CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^- could hydrolyze to form CH3-C≡C-OH, which would be an alkyne carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes. If the diazonium salt is unstable, it might decompose into an alkyne and nitrogen gas. So, CH3-C≡C-N2+ Cl^- → CH3-C≡C-H + N2 + Cl^- ?

Wait, but that would give back propyne and release nitrogen and chloride ions. But then H would be propyne. But propyne is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt under basic conditions forms an aldehyde. So perhaps the product H is CH3-C≡C-OH, but that's not a common structure.

Alternatively, maybe when the diazonium salt is treated with NaOH, it undergoes a different reaction, like the formation of a nitrile. But that's not typical.

Hmm, perhaps if the diazonium salt is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can form an aldehyde. Wait, for example, perhaps the reaction is:

R-N2+Cl^- + NaOH → R-OH + N2 + NaCl

So if R is CH3-C≡C-, then R-OH would be CH3-C≡C-OH. But that's a terminal alkyne carboxylic acid, which is not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes to form a ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) is used as a test for phenols. Phenols give a brown color when treated with FeCl3 because the phenol reacts with Fe^3+ to form a complex. So if H is a phenol, then it would give a positive test. But if H is an aldehyde or a ketone, it wouldn't give that color.

So if H is a phenol, then option B is correct. But in our case, H is the product of the diazonium salt's reaction with NaOH. If the initial structure was an aromatic amine, then H would be a phenol, which would give a brown color. But in our case, the amine is aliphatic, so H wouldn't be a phenol. So option B would be incorrect because H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.

But wait, earlier steps might have been wrong. Let me retrace.

Wait, the initial reaction sequence: the first product A is C3H6, which is propene. Then, bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives propene again. Then, dehydrogenation gives propyne. Then, nitration gives nitropropyne. Then, reduction gives aminopropyne. Then, diazotization gives the diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis gives H.

If H is an aldehyde, then it wouldn't react with FeCl3, so option B would be incorrect. So which option is incorrect?

Looking at the options:

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is an aldehyde or ketone, it won't give a yellow color. But if H is a phenol, it would. So in our reaction, H isn't a phenol; it's an aldehyde or something else. So option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first elimination isn't giving propene, but something else. Let me consider that.

Wait, when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, it could undergo elimination to form an alkene. So the product C would be propene. Then, when passed over red-hot iron, perhaps it forms propyne. Then, E is nitropropyne, which when reduced gives aminopropyne. Then, nitrous acid forms the diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis gives a carbonyl group. So H is a carbonyl compound.

So, what is the structure of H? If E is CH3-C≡C-NO2, then F is CH3-C≡C-NH2. G is CH3-C≡C-N2+Cl^-.

When G is treated with NaOH, perhaps the diazonium salt decomposes. For example, the reaction could be:

CH3-C≡C-N2+Cl^- + NaOH → CH3-C≡C-OH + N2 + NaCl

So H would be CH3-C≡C-OH, which is an alkyne carboxylic acid. But alkyne carboxylic acids are unstable and tend to tautomerize or undergo other reactions. But regardless, H would be CH3-C≡C-OH.

Now, testing H with FeCl3: FeCl3 reacts with phenols to give a brown color. H is a carboxylic acid, so it wouldn't react with FeCl3. Hence, option B's statement is incorrect. Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps when I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let's recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bromination step. What if the starting compound A is cyclopropane (C3H6) instead of propene? Let me think: cyclopropane is C3H6, and bromination in CCl4 could lead to substitution. But cyclopropane is less reactive towards addition reactions, so perhaps it undergoes substitution. But wait, bromination in CCl4 is usually for addition. So cyclopropane would have three equivalent rings, and bromination would likely add across the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination of cyclopropane would lead to ring opening. For example, bromine could add to the cyclopropane ring, opening it into a diene or a brominated compound. But I'm not certain about that. So perhaps the initial assumption that A is propene is correct.

So, with that, H is CH3-C≡C-OH, which is an alkyne carboxylic acid. It wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So option B is incorrect.

Looking back at the options, the incorrect statement is B.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of CCl₄ adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃). Reaction with alcoholic KOH eliminates two molecules of HBr, regenerating propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as compound C. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (CH≡CCH₃), identified as compound D.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃), leading to nitration. The nitro group (-NO₂) adds to the terminal position of the triple bond, forming nitropropyne (CH₃-C≡C-NO₂), identified as compound E. Reduction of E with Fe and HCl converts the nitro group to an amine, yielding aminopropyne (CH₃-C≡C-NH₂), identified as compound F. Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms the diazonium salt (CH₃-C≡C-N₂⁺Cl⁻), identified as compound G. Hydrolysis of G with NaOH produces a carbonyl compound, specifically CH₃-C≡C-OH (an alkyne carboxylic acid), identified as compound H.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: F is CH₃-C≡C-NH₂. While this compound is not commonly associated with dye synthesis, the statement is plausible and does not contradict the reaction sequence.
- **Option B**: H is CH₃-C≡C-OH. This is an alkyne carboxylic acid, which does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color. Phenols, not alkyne carboxylic acids, give a yellow color with FeCl₃. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D is CH₃-C≡C-CH₃ (propyne). In the ¹H NMR spectrum, the CH₃ group produces a singlet (three equivalent protons), and the terminal CH group (on the sp-hybridized carbon) also produces a singlet (one proton). Thus, D gives two singlets, making this statement correct.
- **Option D**: C is CH₂=CHCH₃ (propene). Propene is a flammable gas, making this statement correct.

### Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as H (CH₃-C≡C-OH) does not give a yellow color with FeCl₃. 

Answer: B
