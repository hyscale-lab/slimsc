Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find which energy difference option allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the lifetime of a state affects the uncertainty in its energy measurement. The longer the lifetime (the more time you have to measure), the more precisely you can determine the energy. So the energy uncertainty, ΔE, is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. The formula I think is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

But wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s. So if I compute ΔE for each state, I can find the minimum detectable energy difference between them.

Let me calculate ΔE for both E1 and E2.

For E1 with τ1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

For E2 with τ2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, but to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think again. Each state has its own uncertainty. The maximum uncertainty in each energy measurement is given by their respective ΔE. For them to be distinguishable, the energy difference should be at least the sum of the uncertainties. Or maybe the maximum between the two? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the better (smaller) ΔE.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2. Here, the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So each state's energy has ΔE = ħ / τ.

So, for E1, ΔE1 is 6.582e-7 eV, and for E2, ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So the smaller the ΔE, the more precisely the energy is known.

So when we measure the energy of E2, its uncertainty is about 6.582e-8 eV, and E1's uncertainty is about 6.58e-7 eV.

If we have two states, the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be distinguishable. So the minimum energy difference should be at least ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Calculating that:

ΔE_min = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the concept. The energy levels are E1 and E2, and their uncertainties are ΔE1 and ΔE2. The energy difference between them is |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, because otherwise the intervals might overlap.

So, yes, the energy difference must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but what's the actual question? It asks which option could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Let me calculate the sum:

ΔE1 = 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 6.58e-7.
ΔE2 = 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 0.658e-7.

Adding them: 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A)1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 0.1e-7 → way smaller than 7e-7. Not enough.

Option B)1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C)1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7. So 1e-4 is 1e+3 * 7e-7 ≈ larger than needed. So option C is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. So yes, that's way larger than 7e-7. So it's sufficient.

Option D)1e-8 eV → which is 0.1e-7 eV → again, 0.1e-7 is 0.1 * 1e-7, which is 1e-8. Hmm, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So option D's 1e-8 eV is much smaller than the required 7e-7 eV. So not enough.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the numbers. My calculation for the sum was 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV. So any energy difference above that would be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than this.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recalculate the exact values.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-9) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 (0.0001) eV. 1e-4 is 1e+3 times larger than 1e-7. So 1e-4 eV is 1e+3 * 7.2e-7 ≈ 7.2e-4 eV. So yes, that's way larger than the required 7.2e-7 eV. So option C is acceptable.

The other options are all below the required sum. So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which energy difference allows the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguished, we use the uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty for a state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \) is the reduced Planck's constant, and \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. For the two states:

- For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{min}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 1 \times 10^3 \times 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than the required \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
