Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^3- or PO4^3-?), wait, wait, actually, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but the ions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-. Hmm, orthophosphate ion usually refers to HPO4^2- I think. Or wait, no, wait. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the various deprotonated forms are the phosphate ions. So orthophosphate ion would be HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the terms. Let me think. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. No, wait, actually, no. H3PO4 is triprotic, so:

- H3PO4 (ortho, which is the fully protonated form, not an ion)
- H2PO4^- (di-hydrogen phosphate ion)
- HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion)
- PO4^3- (phosphate ion)

Wait, no, maybe orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the term "orthophosphate" refers to the HPO4^2- ion, which is one of the conjugate bases.

But wait, the question is specifically asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So I need to figure out what that is.

Alternatively, perhaps "orthophosphate" is H3PO4, but that's the acid. Wait, no, the options are in the order of 1e-7 M, which is pretty low. So maybe it's about the phosphate ion, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. It says, "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" So orthophosphate is the ion. So which one is it?

I think in this context, orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Alternatively, perhaps it's the PO4^3- ion. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the salts provided. KH₂PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So the phosphate species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we're asked for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. Because H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate, and HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate, which is the more deprotonated form.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe orthophosphate refers to the PO4^3- ion, but that would be the fully deprotonated form, which is less common, especially in solutions where the pH isn't extremely high.

So, in any case, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

So let's proceed.

First, calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles = mass (g) / molecular weight (g/mol).

For KH₂PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let's compute that.

136.09 is roughly 136.1. 1.00 / 136.1 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Wait, 136.09 is the molecular weight for KH₂PO4. So 1.00 g is 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

So, moles of KH₂PO4 = approx 0.007335 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = approx 0.005614 mol.

When these salts dissolve in water, they dissociate as follows:

KH₂PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

So, in the solution, the H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, and HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4.

So the concentrations of these ions are:

[H2PO4^-] = moles from KH2PO4 / volume in L.

[HPO4^2-] = moles from Na2HPO4 / volume in L.

But wait, perhaps the solution forms a buffer solution because these two are conjugate acid-base pairs.

The relevant equilibrium here is HPO4^2- ↔ H2PO4^- + PO4^3- ?

Wait, no. Let's think about the phosphate equilibria.

H3PO4 is triprotic. The deprotonation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs with Ka2.

So, in the solution, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, then determine the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- based on pH and their initial concentrations.

Wait, but the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If ortho refers to HPO4^2-, then the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M, and [HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

But wait, wait. Let me calculate more accurately:

Moles KH₂PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol.

Molarity [H2PO4^-] = 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.

Moles Na2HPO4: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol.

Molarity [HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

So, the ratio of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- is (0.03667)/(0.02807) ≈ 1.306.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, pKa is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8.

log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) ) 

Wait, no: Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). The base is HPO4^2-.

So [base] is [HPO4^2-], [acid] is [H2PO4^-].

So log([base]/[acid]) is log(0.02807/0.03667) = log(0.7658) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.114 ≈ 7.0936.

Wait, but wait, that's an approximate value. Let me compute more accurately.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M.

Ratio [base]/[acid] = 0.02807 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.7658.

Log(0.7658) = ?

Using log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.76) is about -0.1171, log(0.77) is about -0.1124.

Wait, more accurately, 0.7658 is approximately 0.766.

We can compute log(0.766):

Let me recall that log(7.66) is about 0.8848. So log(0.766) is 0.8848 - 1 = -0.1152.

So log(0.766) ≈ -0.1152.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.1152 ≈ 7.0924.

So the pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, we can think about the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If ortho is HPO4^2-, then we're looking at its concentration. But wait, in solution, HPO4^2- can dissociate further:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).

But the pH is around 7.09. Let's see if this affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

The concentration of PO4^3- can be found using Ka3 and the pH.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But [H+] at pH 7.09 is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So plug in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02807) / (8.12e-8)

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.223e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Close enough.

But wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then this would be the answer. However, if orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02807 M, which is about 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be right.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7. So perhaps the orthophosphate here refers to PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form.

So if that's the case, then the concentration is approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the PO4^3- is a very small concentration. But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which may refer to HPO4^2-, but in that case, the concentration is much higher, but it's not one of the options.

Wait, unless I'm missing something. Because the options are all in the 1e-7 range, which matches with the PO4^3- concentration.

But wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

[H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.12e-8.

Plug in:

(1.8e-12) * (0.02807) = 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8.12e-8: 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 = approximately 6.22e-7.

Yes, that seems right. So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

So that's very close. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is just to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- as it is, but that gives a value much larger than the options, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, but that's not the case because the options are way too small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, what's the actual question again? It says, "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?".

Orthophosphate can refer to the HPO4^2- ion, which is the form in the Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, but then the concentration would be 0.005614 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02807 M, which is 2.807e-2 M, way higher than any of the options. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe orthophosphate refers to H2PO4^-.

But that would have a concentration of 0.03667 M, which is even higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in the initial assumption. Maybe the term "orthophosphate" refers to H3PO4, but that's the acid, not the ion. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. Then the calculation would be correct, leading to option A.

But why would the problem ask for PO4^3- and not HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let's think about the phosphate species in solution.

The two salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which might be the predominant form, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of all phosphate ions, including HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

But that doesn't make sense because the options are way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the concentration of PO4^3- which is much smaller.

In that case, our calculation of 6.22e-7 M would be correct, which is option A.

But wait, the problem states that the solution has 1g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the HPO4^2- concentration is 0.02807 M, and H2PO4^- is 0.03667 M.

The buffer's pH is around 7.09.

Now, considering the third dissociation step:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The equilibrium concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

So the [PO4^3-] is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.12e-8) ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

So that's the concentration of PO4^3-.

Therefore, the orthophosphate ion, if that's PO4^3-, is 6.22e-7 M, which is option A.

Wait, but the options have option D as 3.97e-7, option A as 6.24e-7.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, let's recalculate the pH more accurately.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

Ratio [base]/[acid] = 0.02807 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.7658.

log(0.7658) = ?

I can compute it more accurately. Let's calculate:

log(0.7658) = ln(0.7658) / ln(10).

ln(0.7658) ≈ -0.267.

ln(10) ≈ 2.3026.

So log(0.7658) ≈ -0.267 / 2.3026 ≈ -0.1159.

pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) → 7.2076 + (-0.1159) ≈ 7.0917.

So pH is approximately 7.0917.

[H+] is 10^-7.0917 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8.12e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 = 6.22e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7, matching option A: 6.24e-7.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, why are the moles of each salt 1.00g each? Let me double-check.

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005614 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the solution is dealing with the total phosphate concentration, but that doesn't seem to fit the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, but considering the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is a buffer, and the pH affects the distribution between the two.

But the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate, which I think refers to PO4^3-.

So, after all, the answer is option A: 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the relevant chemical equilibria. The problem involves 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molecular weight = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molecular weight = 177.99 g/mol) dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) of solution. The dissociation reactions are:

1. **KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻**  
2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O**

From the given masses, the moles of each salt are calculated as:  
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol} \)  
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \)

The concentrations of the ions in solution are:  
- \([H₂PO₄^-] = \frac{0.007335}{0.2} \approx 0.03667 \, \text{M}\)  
- \([HPO₄^{2-}] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}\)

The solution forms a buffer between \( \text{H₂PO₄^-} \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO₄^{2-}} \) (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]  
The \( K_a \) value for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄ is \( K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \). Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02807}{0.03667} \right)
\]  
\[
\log \left( \frac{0.02807}{0.03667} \right) = \log(0.7658) \approx -0.115
\]  
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

The pH of the solution is approximately 7.093. At this pH, \( \text{HPO₄^{2-}} \) can further dissociate into \( \text{PO₄^{3-}} \) (orthophosphate ion) via the third dissociation:  
\[
\text{HPO₄^{2-}} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄^{3-}}
\]  
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression for \( K_a \):  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄^{3-}}]}{[\text{HPO₄^{2-}}]}
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( [\text{PO₄^{3-}}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄^{3-}}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄^{2-}}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
The hydrogen ion concentration is \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \). Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄^{3-}}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄^{3-}}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (\( \text{PO₄^{3-}} \)) is approximately \( 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option **A**.

**Answer: A**
