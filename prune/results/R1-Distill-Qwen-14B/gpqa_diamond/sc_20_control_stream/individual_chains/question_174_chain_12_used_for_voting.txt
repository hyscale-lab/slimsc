Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to parse what's being asked. So, the scenario is an atomic nucleus at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

Wait, so the initial mass is M, and the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, after fission, the two fragments' combined rest mass is 0.99*M. That means that some energy is released, right? Because mass is converted into energy, but wait, the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe I don't have to worry about binding energy or anything like that beyond the rest masses.

So, I think the key here is to realize that the system was initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since momentum is conserved, their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Let me denote the masses. Let me call the lighter fragment mass m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of the masses is m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. Wait, that's what the problem says. So 3m = 0.99 M, so m = (0.99/3) M. So the heavier fragment has mass 2m = (0.99 * 2/3) M, which is (0.66) M. Wait, let me compute that: 0.99 divided by 3 is 0.33, so m is 0.33 M, and 2m is 0.66 M. So the initial mass was M, and the two fragments have 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So the total is 0.99 M. So what about the remaining 1%? Oh, that's the energy released, perhaps in the form of kinetic energy.

Right, because in the rest frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the two fragments must move symmetrically, so their velocities (if non-relativistic) would be such that their momenta cancel each other.

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (the 2m one). The problem is asking for the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I need to calculate T1 using relativity and using the non-relativistic approach, then find the difference.

Wait, but wait—when we talk about the rest masses, the rest-mass energy is involved. Let me remember that the rest mass energy is m c². So when the nucleus splits, the rest masses of the two fragments are less than the original, so the mass defect is converted into kinetic energy and other forms (like binding energy, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe it's just kinetic energy).

Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect. So the total energy released is (M_initial - sum of fragments' rest masses) times c². But the problem doesn't give the actual kinetic energy—so perhaps I should consider the energy and momentum conservation.

Let's set up the problem. Let me denote the initial nucleus as being at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments have masses m1 = 0.33 M and m2 = 0.66 M. Wait, no: wait, m is 0.33 M, so the two masses are m and 2m, which are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. But the initial nucleus has mass M, so the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. So the mass defect is 0.01 M. So the energy released is (0.01 M) c². But that energy goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments and any other forms, but perhaps in this problem, we're assuming all the energy goes into kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The total energy must be conserved. So the initial rest energy is M c². After fission, each fragment has rest energy (m1 c² and m2 c²), plus their kinetic energies. So the total energy after fission is (m1 + m2) c² + T1 + T2. But since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total energy before is M c². So M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + T1 + T2.

But m1 + m2 is 0.99 M c², so:

M c² = 0.99 M c² + T1 + T2
=> T1 + T2 = (M - 0.99 M) c² = 0.01 M c².

So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 0.01 M c². Now, that's the total, but how is it split between T1 and T2?

But also, momentum must be conserved. The initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2, for the two fragments. Then, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Wait, but wait: since they're moving in opposite directions, perhaps I should write the magnitudes. Let me think in terms of vectors: the total momentum is m1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0. So m1 v1 = - m2 v2. Taking magnitudes, m1 |v1| = m2 |v2|. So |v1| / |v2| = m2/m1.

Given that m2 is 0.66 M and m1 is 0.33 M, so m2/m1 is 2. So |v1| = 2 |v2|.

But wait, wait. Let me get that right. m1 is 0.33 M, m2 is 0.66 M. So m2 = 2 m1. So m2/m1 = 2. So |v1| = 2 |v2|.

So, the velocities are related by v1 = 2 v2, but considering direction, perhaps v1 is in one direction and v2 in the opposite, so their vector sum is zero.

Now, to find the kinetic energies, we can set up the equations.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to model this in the center-of-momentum frame, but since the initial is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the two fragments move in opposite directions with their velocities such that their momenta cancel.

So, for the non-relativistic case, let's model T1 and T2.

In non-relativistic mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

But perhaps an easier approach is to use the fact that the velocities are related, and the kinetic energies can be expressed in terms of each other.

Let me proceed step by step.

In non-relativistic case:

We have m1 v1 = m2 v2. Since m2 is 2 m1, let's say m2 = 2 m1.

So m1 v1 = 2 m1 v2 => v1 = 2 v2.

The kinetic energies are T1 = (1/2) m2 v1², T2 = (1/2) m1 v2².

But since v1 = 2 v2, let's substitute:

T1 = (1/2)(2 m1)( (2 v2) )² = (1/2)(2 m1) (4 v2²) ) = (1/2)*2*4 m1 v2² = 4 m1 v2².

T2 = (1/2) m1 v2².

So T1 = 4 T2.

But we know that T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c².

So 4 T2 + T2 = 5 T2 = 0.01 M c² => T2 = 0.002 M c².

Then T1 = 4 * 0.002 M c² = 0.008 M c².

So in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) is 0.008 M c².

Wait, but wait: M is in terms of the nucleus's rest mass. But the initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, so M c² = 300 GeV.

So T1 (non-relativistic) is 0.008 * 300 GeV = 2.4 GeV. Wait, that's 2400 MeV. That seems way too high. But wait, the problem is talking about the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1. So perhaps the relativistic approach gives a different value.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait: if M c² is 300 GeV, then the kinetic energy in non-relativistic case is 0.008 * 300 GeV = 2.4 GeV, which is 2400 MeV. But that's way larger than the options given (like tens of MeV). So perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass M is in terms of rest mass, which is 300 GeV/c², so M = 300 GeV/(c²), so when I compute the kinetic energy, I have to be careful with units.

Wait, let me make this clear. Let me define:

M = M_initial = 300 GeV / c².

Because, the rest-mass energy is M c² = 300 GeV.

So, when I compute the kinetic energy, T1 is (non-relativistic) 0.008 * M c² = 0.008 * 300 GeV = 2.4 GeV.

But that's 2400 MeV, which is way higher than the options given. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the non-relativistic approximation gives a much lower value than the relativistic calculation, and the difference is small in comparison.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should consider that the velocities are a significant fraction of c, so relativistic effects are important, which would change the kinetic energy and the way momentum is calculated.

So let me try to model this relativistically.

In relativity, the momentum is gamma m v, and the energy is gamma m c².

So, because the total initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, m1 gamma1 v1 = m2 gamma2 v2.

Wait, but since m2 = 2 m1, we have m1 gamma1 v1 = 2 m1 gamma2 v2.

Simplify: gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model in terms of velocities and the fact that the momenta are equal and opposite.

But maybe a better approach is to consider the energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote:

m1 = 0.33 M, m2 = 0.66 M.

Wait, because m1 = 0.33 M, m2 = 2 m1 = 0.66 M.

So, the sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, the initial energy is E_initial = M c².

After fission, the energy is E_final = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2).

So, M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + T1 + T2.

Which, as before, gives T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c².

Now, for momentum conservation:

p1 + p2 = 0.

Which gives p1 = - p2.

So, |p1| = |p2|.

In terms of relativistic momentum:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m2 = 2 m1, this becomes:

gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but that's one equation. Also, the energy of each fragment is:

E1 = gamma1 m1 c²,

E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

But E1 = T1 + m1 c²,

E2 = T2 + m2 c².

So, gamma1 m1 c² = T1 + m1 c²,

gamma2 m2 c² = T2 + m2 c².

So, gamma1 = (T1 + m1 c²) / (m1 c²) ) = 1 + T1/(m1 c² )

Similarly, gamma2 = 1 + T2/(m2 c² )

But this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but I also have gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Hmm. Let's think about the velocities in terms of beta. Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So, v1 = beta1 c,

v2 = beta2 c.

Then, the momentum equation becomes:

gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

The c's cancel, so:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m2 = 2 m1, so:

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

Hmm.

Also, from the energy perspective, since T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c², and T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

Wait, perhaps I can write T1 as (gamma1 - 1) m1 c²,

and T2 as (gamma2 - 1) m2 c².

So, substituting:

T1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c².

And T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c².

But M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV/c².

So, M c² = 300 GeV.

So, 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, but in the non-relativistic case earlier, I got T1 as 2.4 GeV and T2 as 0.6 GeV, which adds up to 3 GeV. So that's correct.

But in reality, the relativistic approach could yield a different distribution between T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach overestimates the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment because it doesn't account for relativistic effects, which become significant when velocities are a significant fraction of c.

But how do I proceed with the relativistic calculation?

Let me think about the system. Let me denote E1 = T1 + m1 c²,

E2 = T2 + m2 c².

E1 + E2 = M c² = 300 GeV.

But wait no, because M c² = 300 GeV. But E1 + E2 is (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) ) = (m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2) ) = 0.99 M c² + 0.01 M c² = M c², which checks out.

So, we have:

gamma1 = (T1 + m1 c²) / (m1 c² ) = 1 + T1/(m1 c²),

gamma2 = (T2 + m2 c²) / (m2 c² ) = 1 + T2/(m2 c²).

And from the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m2 = 2 m1, so:

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

I can write beta in terms of gamma. Remember that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

Substituting into the momentum equation:

gamma1 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²) = 2 gamma2 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

Hmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

So:

gamma1² (1 - 1/gamma1²) = 4 gamma2² (1 - 1/gamma2²).

Simplify left side: gamma1² - 1,

Right side: 4 gamma2² - 4.

So,

gamma1² - 1 = 4 gamma2² - 4.

Rearranged:

gamma1² = 4 gamma2² -3.

Hmm, that's a relation between gamma1 and gamma2.

But from the energy equation, I have:

T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Also, since T1 = (gamma1 -1 ) m1 c²,

and T2 = (gamma2 -1 ) m2 c²,

and m2 = 2 m1,

So,

T1 = (gamma1 -1 ) m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma2 -1 ) * 2 m1 c².

So,

T1 + T2 = [ (gamma1 -1) + 2 (gamma2 -1) ] m1 c² = 3 GeV.

Express m1 c² as (0.33 M) c², since m1 =0.33 M.

But M c² = 300 GeV, so m1 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So,

[ (gamma1 -1) + 2 (gamma2 -1) ] * 99 GeV = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV:

(gamma1 -1) + 2 (gamma2 -1) = 3 /99 = 1/33.

Simplify:

gamma1 -1 + 2 gamma2 -2 = (1/33).

So,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = (1/33) + 3 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.

Wait,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = (1/33) + 3 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.

So,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3.0303.

And earlier from the momentum equation, we had:

gamma1² = 4 gamma2² -3.

Hmm, so now we have two equations:

1) gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3.0303,

2) gamma1² = 4 gamma2² -3.

So, we can try to solve these equations.

Let me denote equation 1 as:

gamma1 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma2.

Substitute into equation 2:

(3.0303 - 2 gamma2)^2 = 4 gamma2^2 -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2 *3.0303 * 2 gamma2 + (2 gamma2)^2 = 4 gamma2² -3.

Calculating each term:

3.0303^2 ≈ (3.0303)^2 ≈ let's compute it: 3^2 is 9, 0.0303^2 is about 0.0009, and 2*3*0.0303 ≈ 0.1818, so 3.0303^2 ≈ 9 + 0.1818 + 0.0009 ≈ 9.1827.

So:

9.1827 - 12.1212 gamma2 + 4 gamma2² = 4 gamma2² -3.

Hmm, subtracting 4 gamma2² from both sides:

9.1827 -12.1212 gamma2 = -3.

Bring -3 to the left:

9.1827 +3 -12.1212 gamma2 =0,

12.1827 -12.1212 gamma2 = 0.

So,

12.1212 gamma2 = 12.1827,

gamma2 ≈ 12.1827 / 12.1212 ≈ approximately 1.005.

Wait, wait, 12.1827 divided by 12.1212.

Let me compute that:

12.1827 /12.1212.

Compute numerator and denominator:

12.1212 * 1.005 = 12.1212 + (12.1212 *0.005) = 12.1212 + 0.0606 = 12.1818.

Hmm, which is very close to the numerator 12.1827. So, approximately, gamma2 is approximately 1.005.

So, gamma2 ≈ 1.005.

Then gamma1 = 3.0303 -2 * 1.005 = 3.0303 - 2.01 = 1.0203.

So, gamma1 ≈ 1.0203.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Because when I had 9.1827 -12.1212 gamma2 = -3,

Adding 3 to both sides: 12.1827 = 12.1212 gamma2,

So gamma2 = 12.1827 / 12.1212 ≈ 1.005.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, gamma2 ≈ 1.005,

gamma1 ≈ 1.0203.

Now, let's compute T1 and T2.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

m1 c² = 99 GeV,

gamma1 ≈ 1.0203,

so (gamma1-1) ≈ 0.0203,

T1 ≈ 0.0203 * 99 GeV ≈ approx 2.0097 GeV ≈ 2.01 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = (gamma2 -1) * 2 m1 c²,

gamma2 -1 is 0.005,

so T2 = 0.005 * 2 *99 GeV = 0.005 * 198 GeV = 0.99 GeV.

So, T1 ≈ 2.01 GeV,

T2 ≈ 0.99 GeV,

which adds up to approximately 3 GeV, as expected.

In the non-relativistic case, we calculated T1 as 2.4 GeV.

So the correct relativistic T1 is about 2.01 GeV, while the non-relativistic approximation gives 2.4 GeV.

The difference would be 2.4 - 2.01 = 0.39 GeV, which is 390 MeV. But that's way larger than the options given, which are all in the range of a few MeV.

Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the m1 and m2. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But the initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, so M c² = 300 GeV.

Wait, but m1 and m2 are rest masses, so their sum is 0.99 M in terms of rest mass.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But the initial nucleus is of rest mass M, so the mass defect is 0.01 M, which is converted into kinetic energy.

But in our earlier non-relativistic case, we had T1 being 2.4 GeV, which is way larger than the 3 GeV total kinetic energy (since T1 + T2 =3 GeV), but wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, T1 was 2.4 GeV and T2 0.6 GeV, adding to 3 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, T1 is about 2 GeV and T2 about 1 GeV, which also adds to 3 GeV.

So the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is 2.4 - 2.01 = 0.39 GeV = 390 MeV. But the options are 2, 5, 10, 20 MeV. So perhaps I've messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the non-relativistic case gives a higher T1 than the relativistic case. But according to the numbers, the non-relativistic case gives higher T1, which would mean the correct T1 is lower, so the difference is negative, but the question says to find the difference between the correct and the non-relativistic, so perhaps it's 390 MeV, but that's not an option. So something's wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the approximation for the non-relativistic case is based on the assumption that kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy. But in this case, the kinetic energy is about 3 GeV, and the rest mass is 300 GeV, so 3 GeV is 1% of 300 GeV. So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is a good one, and the relativistic effects are small, making the difference between the two approaches small.

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 2.4 GeV, which is about 0.8% of the rest mass energy (300 GeV). So perhaps the non-relativistic approach is acceptable, but the correct approach shows a small difference.

Wait, but according to the earlier relativistic calculation, the T1 is 2.01 GeV, which is about 2.01e3 MeV, which is 2010 MeV. Wait, no, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 2.01 GeV is 2010 MeV. But that's way higher than the options given. So perhaps I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different method, perhaps considering that the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass, and hence using a different approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the binding energy and how the velocity relates to the kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: in the center of mass frame, which in this case is the same as the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the fragments move with opposite velocities. The key is to find their velocities and hence their kinetic energies.

But perhaps using the relativistic formula for kinetic energy in terms of the velocity ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the problem using the concept of invariant mass.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the situation using the rest mass of the nucleus and the rest masses of the fragments.

Wait, the initial rest mass is M, and the fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, summing to 0.99 M.

The mass defect is 0.01 M, which is converted into kinetic energy.

So, the total kinetic energy of the system is 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

Now, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is distributed as T1 = (2.4 GeV) and T2 = (0.6 GeV), as calculated earlier.

But when considering relativity, the kinetic energies are different.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the kinetic energy of each fragment can be found using the relation:

T = (p^2 c²)/(2 m)  (non-relativistic),

but in reality, it's T = (p² c²)/(2 m) [but relativistic expressions are more complicated].

Wait, but perhaps I can find the velocities from the momentum conservation and energy conservation.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and the two fragments have a mass ratio of 2:1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the problem using the velocity of the center of mass, but that's the same as the initial frame.

Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of the velocity of each fragment in terms of the beta parameter.

Let me try another approach.

Let me denote the speed of the more massive fragment as v.

Since m2 = 2 m1,

from momentum conservation,

m1 v1 = m2 v2,

but with m2=2 m1,

m1 v1 = 2 m1 v2,

so v1 = 2 v2.

Wait, but in reality, they're moving in opposite directions, so v1 = -2 v2.

But for the sake of magnitude, let's just consider the magnitudes.

In the non-relativistic case, I found that T1 = 2.4 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is higher for the lighter fragment? Or perhaps lower.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I found that the relativistic T1 was about 2 GeV, which is less than the non-relativistic T1 of 2.4 GeV. So the difference would be about 0.4 GeV, which is 400 MeV, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the rest mass energy, not the mass itself.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I took M as 300 GeV/c², but for the rest masses, I should have considered their rest mass energies.

Wait, no, because the rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is M c² = 300 GeV.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy in the non-relativistic case is being miscalculated.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

But when you have two masses, m and 2m, the velocities are such that m v = 2m v', so v = 2 v'.

So, the kinetic energy for the 2m fragment is (1/2)(2m)(v)^2 = m v²,

and for the m fragment is (1/2) m (v/2)^2 = (1/2) m (v²/4) )= (m v²)/8.

So, the total kinetic energy is (m v² + m v²/8 ) = (9/8) m v².

Which equals 3 GeV.

So,

9/8 m v² = 3 GeV,

so m v² = (3 GeV) * (8/9) ) = 2.666... GeV.

So,

T1 = m v² = 2.6667 GeV ≈ 2.6667 GeV.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. What's going on?

Wait, perhaps I confused the notation earlier.

Wait, let me redo the non-relativistic calculation.

Let me denote:

m1 = m,

m2 = 2m.

Total mass after fission: 3m = 0.99 M,

so m = 0.33 M,

m2 = 0.66 M.

In non-relativistic case, the velocities are such that m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Since m2 = 2 m1,

v1 = 2 v2.

The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2) is T1 = (1/2) m2 v2^2.

The kinetic energy of the lighter fragment is T2 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2) m1 (2 v2)^2 = (1/2) m1 *4 v2² = 2 m1 v2².

So,

T1 = (1/2)(2 m1) (v2^2) )= m1 v2².

T2 = 2 m1 v2².

So, T1 + T2 = 3 m1 v2² = 3 GeV.

So,

m1 v2² = 1 GeV.

Thus,

T1 = 1 GeV,

T2 = 2 GeV.

Wait, that's different from earlier. So the more massive fragment has kinetic energy of 1 GeV, and the lighter has 2 GeV.

But that can't be right because in non-relativistic mechanics, the more massive object should have lower kinetic energy if they are moving in opposite directions with momenta balancing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assignments.

Wait, m2 is more massive, so it should have lower speed. So let me think again.

Wait, in momentum conservation:

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

m2 =2 m1,

so v1 = 2 v2.

So, the lighter fragment (m1) has higher velocity.

So, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1 = (1/2) m2 v2².

That's (1/2)(2 m1) v2^2 = m1 v2^2.

And the kinetic energy of the lighter fragment is T2 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2) m1 (2 v2)^2 = 2 m1 v2^2.

So, T1 = m1 v2^2,

T2 = 2 m1 v2^2.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 m1 v2^2 = 3 GeV.

So,

m1 v2^2 = 1 GeV.

Thus,

T1 = 1 GeV,

T2 = 2 GeV.

Ah, so earlier I had it reversed. So the more massive fragment has T1 =1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic calculation earlier, I found T1 to be about 2 GeV. Which would mean the difference is about 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV, but the options are much smaller.

Wait, but that contradicts. So perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic approach.

Wait, no, in the relativistic approach, I found T1 to be about 2 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic 1 GeV. So the difference would be 1 GeV, but that's again not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the relativistic equations.

Wait, let's go back to the relativistic case.

We have:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

m2 = 2 m1,

so,

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

We also have:

gamma1 = 1 + T1/(m1 c²),

gamma2 = 1 + T2/(m2 c²).

And,

T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But perhaps I can model this using the velocity variables.

Let me assume that the more massive fragment (m2) has velocity v, and the lighter (m1) has velocity u.

From momentum conservation: m1 u = m2 v.

Since m2=2 m1,

u = 2 v.

In non-relativistic case, u=2v, and the KEs are T1 = (1/2) m2 v², T2 = (1/2) m1 (2v)^2.

But in the relativistic case, the velocities are higher, so the kinetic energies are higher than the non-relativistic values.

But perhaps I can find an expression for the kinetic energies in terms of v.

The kinetic energy of each fragment is:

T1 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c²,

T2 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²),

beta = v/c,

so,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So,

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)),

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

But since u = 2v,

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (4 v²/c²)).

Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of v.

So,

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (4 v²/c²)),

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Now, the kinetic energies are:

T1 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c²,

T2 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

And,

T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

But m2 = 2 m1,

so,

T1 = (gamma2 -1) 2 m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

So,

2 (gamma2 -1) m1 c² + (gamma1 -1) m1 c² =3 GeV.

Factor out m1 c²,

m1 c² [ 2(gamma2 -1) + (gamma1 -1) ] =3 GeV.

We know that m1 c² = (0.33 M) c² = 0.33 *300 GeV =99 GeV.

So,

99 GeV * [ 2(gamma2 -1) + (gamma1 -1) ] =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV,

2(gamma2 -1) + (gamma1 -1) = 3 /99 = 1/33 ≈0.0303.

So,

2 gamma2 -2 + gamma1 -1 = 1/33,

which simplifies to,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 ≈3.0303.

So,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 ≈3.0303.

Now, from the momentum equation,

gamma1 m1 u = gamma2 m2 v.

But m2=2 m1, and u=2v,

so,

gamma1 m1 (2v) = gamma2 (2 m1) v,

which simplifies to,

gamma1 *2v = gamma2 *2v.

Cancel 2v,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So,

gamma1 = gamma2.

But earlier, we had gamma1 + 2 gamma2 =3.0303.

If gamma1 =gamma2,

then,

gamma1 + 2 gamma1 =3.0303,

3 gamma1=3.0303,

gamma1=1.0101.

So gamma2=1.0101.

Hmm, that simplifies things.

So,

gamma1= gamma2=1.0101.

So,

gamma-1=0.0101.

Thus,

T1 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c² = 0.0101 * (2 m1) c².

m1 c²=99 GeV,

so,

T1 =0.0101 * 2 *99 GeV =0.0101 * 198 GeV ≈ 2.00 GeV.

Similarly,

T2=(gamma1 -1) m1 c² =0.0101 *99 GeV≈1.0 GeV.

So, T1≈2 GeV,

T2≈1 GeV,

which adds to 3 GeV.

Wait, but according to this, the correct T1 is about 2 GeV, while the non-relativistic case gives T1 as 1 GeV. So the difference would be 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are way smaller.

Hmm, this suggests that I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic calculation gives T1 as 1 GeV, and the correct relativistic T1 is 2 GeV, giving a difference of 1 GeV. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic approach.

Wait, earlier I thought the non-relativistic T1 was 1 GeV, but perhaps I should double-check that.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case:

m1 = m,

m2=2m,

m1 + m2 =3m=0.99 M,

so m=0.33 M,

m2=0.66 M.

Momentum conservation: m1 u = m2 v,

so m u = 2 m v → u=2v.

Kinetic energy of m2: T1 = (1/2) m2 v² = (1/2)(2m) v² = m v².

Kinetic energy of m1: T2= (1/2) m u² = (1/2) m (4 v²) )= 2 m v².

So, T1 + T2 =3 m v²=3 GeV,

so m v²=1 GeV.

So,

T1 =m v²=1 GeV.

So in non-relativistic case, T1 is1 GeV,

In relativistic case, T1 is about2 GeV,

so the difference is1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But that's not an option. The options are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the gamma factors are actually leading to a higher T1, but the difference between the two approaches might be small.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the kinetic energy using the relativistic work done, considering that the mass defect leads to the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the key is to calculate the total kinetic energy and then determine the distribution between the two fragments.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the rest mass of the fragments and the fact that the total energy is conserved.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I assumed the non-relativistic case gives T1 as1 GeV, but in reality, the non-relativistic calculation might give a different value.

Wait, let's re-express the non-relativistic case.

T1 = (1/2) m2 v^2,

T2= (1/2) m1 u^2,

with u=2v.

So,

T1 = (1/2)(2m1) v^2= m1 v^2,

T2= (1/2) m1 (2v)^2= 2 m1 v^2.

So,

T1 + T2=3 m1 v^2=3 GeV,

so m1 v^2=1 GeV,

so,

T1=1 GeV,

T2=2 GeV,

which adds to 3 GeV.

So, the non-relativistic T1 is1 GeV,

the relativistic T1 is approximately 2 GeV,

so the difference is1 GeV, which isn't an option.

But the problem's options are all in the range of MeV, which is much smaller.

Ah, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me check.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. But the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So M is in terms of rest mass, so M c²=300 GeV.

But the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, which is why the non-relativistic approach is a good approximation.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, I found T1=2 GeV, which is 2000 MeV. But the options are way smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the relativistic case.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that gamma1=gamma2.

Earlier, when I considered the equation gamma1 beta1 =2 gamma2 beta2,

and then with u=2v,

gamma1 beta1 =2 gamma2 beta2,

but beta1= u/c=2v/c,

beta2= v/c.

So,

gamma1*(2v/c) = 2 gamma2*(v/c),

which simplifies to,

2 gamma1 v/c =2 gamma2 v/c,

so,

gamma1=gamma2.

Ah, so that's why gamma1=gamma2.

Thus, in the relativistic case, gamma1=gamma2=gamma.

So, from the equation gamma1 + 2 gamma2 =3.0303,

we have gamma + 2 gamma =3.0303,

3 gamma=3.0303,

gamma=1.0101.

Thus, gamma=1.0101,

so,

T1= (gamma -1)* m2 c² = (0.0101) * 0.66 *300 GeV

Wait, wait,

m2 =0.66 M,

so m2 c² =0.66 *300 GeV=198 GeV.

So,

T1=0.0101 *198 GeV=2.00 GeV.

Similarly, T2=0.0101 *99 GeV=1.0 GeV.

So, the relativistic T1 is 2 GeV.

But according to the non-relativistic approach, T1 is1 GeV.

So the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are much smaller.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the T1 using the non-relativistic approach.

So, correct T1 is2 GeV,

non-relativistic T1 is1 GeV,

so the difference is1 GeV.

But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the kinetic energy in the non-relativistic case is much smaller, and the relativistic correction is small, leading to a small difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic case. Let me re-express the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass, so we can use a Taylor expansion for gamma.

Since gamma=1 + (1/2) beta^2 + ...,

and KE ≈ (p^2)/(2m).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the kinetic energy is small, so we can approximate gamma as 1 + (p²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps that's a way to proceed.

So, for each fragment,

gamma ≈1 + (p²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma1 =1 + (p1^2)/(2 m1 c²),

gamma2=1 + (p2^2)/(2 m2 c²).

But from momentum conservation,

p1 = m2 p2 / m1.

Since m2=2 m1,

p1=2 p2.

So,

p1=2 p2.

So,

gamma1 =1 + ( (2 p2)^2 )/(2 m1 c² )

= 1 + (4 p2^2)/(2 m1 c² )

=1 + (2 p2^2)/(m1 c²).

Similarly,

gamma2=1 + (p2^2)/(2 m2 c² )

=1 + (p2^2)/(2*(2 m1) c² )

=1 + (p2^2)/(4 m1 c²).

Now,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3.0303.

Substituting,

[1 + (2 p2^2)/(m1 c²)] + 2 [1 + (p2^2)/(4 m1 c²) ] =3.0303.

Expanding,

1 + (2 p2²)/(m1 c²) + 2*1 + 2*(p2²/(4 m1 c²)) =3.0303.

Simplify,

3 + (2 p2²)/(m1 c²) + (p2²)/(2 m1 c²) )=3.0303.

Combine terms:

3 + (5 p2²)/(2 m1 c² ) )=3.0303.

Subtract 3,

(5 p2²)/(2 m1 c² )=0.0303.

Multiply both sides by (2 m1 c²)/5,

p2^2 = (0.0303 * 2 m1 c² )/5.

So,

p2^2= (0.0606 m1 c² )/5 =0.01212 m1 c².

Now, the kinetic energy of fragment 2 (lighter one) is T2= (p2^2 c²)/(2 m1 c^2) )= p2^2/(2 m1).

But p2^2=0.01212 m1 c^2,

so,

T2= (0.01212 m1 c^2 )/(2 m1 c^2 )= 0.01212/(2) =0.00606.

But m1 c^2 is99 GeV,

so,

T2=0.00606 *99 GeV≈0.6 GeV.

Similarly, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment,

T1= (p1^2 c^2)/(2 m2 c^2 )= (p1^2 )/(2 m2 ).

But p1=2 p2,

so,

p1^2=4 p2^2=4 *0.01212 m1 c^2 =0.04848 m1 c^2.

So,

T1=0.04848 m1 c^2/(2 * 2 m1 )= 0.04848 m1 c^2/(4 m1 )=0.04848/(4)=0.01212 GeV=12.12 MeV.

Wait, that's about 12 MeV.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting T1 as12 MeV in this approximation.

In the non-relativistic case, I found T1 as1 GeV (1000 MeV), which is way higher.

This suggests that the relativistic approach gives a smaller T1 than the non-relativistic approach, which would imply the difference is about 1000 MeV - 12 MeV=988 MeV, which is not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem using the fact that the kinetic energy is small, so gamma is approximately 1 + (p²)/(2 m c^2) ), and then find the difference.

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to summarize.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV,

In the relativistic case, using the approximation, T1 is about12 MeV,

so the difference between correct and non-relativistic would be 1 GeV -12 MeV= 988 MeV.

But that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the non-relativistic calculation is way off, and the correct relativistic calculation shows a much lower T1, but that would produce a large difference, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the difference to be about a few MeV, so the correct approach is to calculate the relativistic correction to the non-relativistic T1.

So, perhaps the non-relativistic T1 is1 GeV,

and the relativistic T1 is, say, 1.01 GeV,

so the difference is about0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

Which would match option C) 10 MeV.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)2 MeV.

But given the confusion, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass, so the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic approaches is small.

In that case, the non-relativistic T1 is1 GeV,

the relativistic T1 is1 GeV + delta,

and the delta is small.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the kinetic energy in the relativistic case to the non-relativistic case.

In the non-relativistic case, KE= (1/2) m v^2,

relativistically, KE= (gamma -1) m c^2.

So,

gamma=1 + KE/(m c^2).

But in non-relativistic case,

gamma≈1 + (v²)/(2 c^2),

so,

relativistic KE≈ (v^2)/(2 c^2) * m c^2= (1/2) m v^2= non-relativistic KE.

So, the non-relativistic approximation is valid when KE << m c^2.

But in this problem, KE is about 3 GeV, and m c^2 is about 300 GeV, so 1% of the rest mass. So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable, and the relativistic correction is small.

So, perhaps the difference between the two approaches is small, around a few MeV.

But given the confusion in earlier calculations, perhaps the correct answer is option C)10 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an atomic nucleus of rest-mass energy 300 GeV undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments, with the more massive fragment having twice the rest mass of the lighter one. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, leaving a 1% mass defect converted into kinetic energy. The task is to determine the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and the kinetic energy calculated using the non-relativistic approximation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Setup and Conservation Laws**:
   - The initial rest mass energy of the nucleus is \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - After fission, the total rest mass of the fragments is \( 0.99M \), leaving a mass defect of \( 0.01M \), which is converted into kinetic energy. Thus, the total kinetic energy of the system is:
     \[
     T_1 + T_2 = 0.01M c^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]
   - The two fragments have rest masses \( m_1 = 0.33M \) and \( m_2 = 0.66M \), with \( m_2 = 2m_1 \). Momentum conservation requires \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), leading to \( v_1 = 2v_2 \).

2. **Non-Relativistic Case**:
   - In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).
   - Using \( v_1 = 2v_2 \), the kinetic energies are:
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1(2v_2)^2 = 2m_1v_2^2.
     \]
   - Substituting \( m_2 = 2m_1 \), the total kinetic energy is:
     \[
     T_1 + T_2 = 3m_1v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( m_1v_2^2 \), we find \( m_1v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:
     \[
     T_1 = m_1v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

3. **Relativistic Case**:
   - In the relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by \( T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
   - Using momentum conservation \( m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \) and \( m_2 = 2m_1 \), we find \( v_1 = 2v_2 \). The relativistic momenta are \( p_1 = \gamma_1m_1v_1 \) and \( p_2 = \gamma_2m_2v_2 \), leading to \( \gamma_1m_1v_1 = \gamma_2m_2v_2 \).
   - Substituting \( v_1 = 2v_2 \) and \( m_2 = 2m_1 \), we simplify to \( \gamma_1 = \gamma_2 \). The total energy conservation equation \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) is used to solve for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \).
   - After solving, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is approximately \( T_1 \approx 2 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Difference Between Approaches**:
   - The non-relativistic calculation gives \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \), while the relativistic calculation gives \( T_1 \approx 2 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
     \[
     \Delta T_1 = 2 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - However, this result is inconsistent with the provided options, which are much smaller. This suggests that the relativistic correction to the non-relativistic result is small, likely on the order of a few MeV. Given the options, the most reasonable estimate for the difference is **10 MeV**.

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic approximation is approximately **10 MeV**.
