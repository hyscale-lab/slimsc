Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when compounds have chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, each of the given compounds needs to be checked for such centers.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, in biphenyls, the substituents are on each ring. If the substituents are in positions that create a plane of symmetry, maybe not chiral. But with two nitro groups on each ring at positions 6 and 6', and the ester groups at 2 and 2', I'm thinking about whether the molecule has a chiral center. Each of the central carbons (if any) needs to check. Wait, no, maybe the structure is such that each ester (O-C-O) is attached to the biphenyl. Alternatively, perhaps the central connecting carbon (from the biphenyl) has substituents. Wait, 1,1'-biphenyl means that the two benzene rings are connected via a single bond between the two C1 positions. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. For each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So, looking at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring.

Wait, for the first compound, each of the ester groups is on the 2 position of each ring. So, each ring has two ester groups (as the structure is dimethyl, so two ester groups on each ring). No, wait, no, the name is dimethyl, so each ester is a methyl ester. So each ring has a carboxylate ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. So each ring is attached at position 1 to the other ring.

Wait, but the question is about whether the molecule itself has a chiral center. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Let's see the structure.

The central connection is between the two rings. Each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6 positions. So for each ring, the substituents are: a methyl ester at 2, a nitro at 6, and the two adjacent carbons in the ring. But the substituents on the central carbon (the one connected to the other ring) would be two phenyl groups (since each ring is connected via C1), a nitro group (on the same ring?), and an ester group? Wait, maybe not. Maybe the substituents are on the ring carbons, not on the central one. So perhaps each ring has its own substituents, so the central carbon (C1) is connected to two phenyl groups (from each ring) and two other substituents? No, because the rings are connected via a single bond; each ring's C1 is connected to the other ring's C1. So the central carbon is part of each ring, so each has a connection to the other ring. Therefore, the substituents on the C1 (central) would be two rings, and perhaps two other substituents?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro so each ring has a nitro group at position 6. The 2,2'- positions have the ester groups. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The central carbon (from each ring) is connected to the other ring. So, the central carbon (C1 of each ring) is bonded to two other carbons (from the ring), the other ring's C1, and a substituent? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, and the central C1 is connected to two other carbons in the ring and the other ring. So the central C1 might have two phenyl groups (from the two rings) and two other substituents. But wait, each ring is a benzene ring, so each C1 is part of the ring. So the C1 on each ring is attached to three other carbons (the ring) and the other ring's C1. So the central carbon is actually a single atom, but in a biphenyl, it's a single bond between two rings. So each ring's C1 is connected to three ring carbons and the other ring's C1. So no, those carbons are not chiral centers because they don't have four different groups attached. So maybe the substituents at positions 2 and 6 of each ring have their own carbons that could be chiral centers.

Wait, the ester groups are on the 2 position. So the substituent at 2 is a methyl ester, and at 6 is a nitro group. So the carbon at position 2 on each ring has a methyl ester (O-C-OCH3), a hydrogen (since it's part of the benzene ring), and two adjacent carbons (the ring). Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and two substituents. So the carbon at position 2 would have a methyl ester, a nitro group (from position 6?), no, wait, position 6 is on the same ring. Wait, perhaps each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6. So the 2 position of ring A is the ester, and the 6 is nitro. Similarly, ring B has ester at 2 and nitro at 6.

But I'm trying to find if any of the carbons in the molecule have four different groups attached. Let's think about the ester group. The ester is O-C-OCH3, attached to the ring. So the carbon attached to the oxygen (the ester's carbonyl carbon) is connected to O, two oxygen atoms (the ester and the ring), and the ring's carbon. Wait, no, the ester's carbonyl is O-CO-OCH3. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to an oxygen (from the ester), the ring's carbon, and two oxygen atoms? No, wait, the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3. So the carbon adjacent to the ring is attached to the oxygen of the ester, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting too stuck on this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then it wouldn't have optical isomers. But if the substituents are in positions that result in no symmetry, then it could have chiral centers.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is in a position that creates a chiral center. Let's think: for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So, if the molecule is symmetrical, like if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it might not have a chiral center. But if the substituents are on opposite sides, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for isomerism because of the way the substituents are arranged around it. Wait, that's more about geometric isomerism, perhaps. But optical isomerism is about the arrangement of substituents around a chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on for now and come back to this.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But with a hydroxy on the second carbon. So the structure would be (CH2CHOH)COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO-. But wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with three carbons: COO- is on the first carbon, then CH2 in the middle, then CH3. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the propanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (CH2) has a hydroxyl, a methyl group (from the first CH2?), no, wait, the structure is: the first carbon is CH2(OH), then CH2 connected to the COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2. So the central carbon has two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3. Wait, no, the central carbon is connected to: OH, two CH2 groups (from either side), and the COOCH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm not visualizing it correctly.

Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the propanoate ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (second C) is attached to:

- One OH group
- One CH2COOCH3 group
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, the structure is: the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to a CH2 group on one side and a COOCH3 on the other.

Wait, maybe it's:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's:

CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3

So the three substituents on the central carbon (CH(OH)) are: a CH2 group (from the left), a COOCH3 group (from the right), and an OH. Wait, but that would only be three substituents; the fourth would be a hydrogen. So the central carbon has four substituents: CH2-, COOCH3, OH, and H. So four different groups? Wait, CH2- (to the left), COOCH3 (to the right), OH, and H. So yes, four different groups. So this would make the central carbon a chiral center. So this compound would exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 has optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: that's diphenyl ketone, so the structure is (Ph)2CO. The carbonyl group is between two benzene rings. So the carbon in the ketone is double-bonded to oxygen, and connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The ketone carbon has two phenyl groups, one O, and a double bond (so not four substituents). Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's connected to two phenyl groups and two O (but one is double-bonded, so it's not a substituent). So the substituents are two phenyl groups and an O (from the double bond). So the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups. Additionally, benzophenone is symmetrical; each side is the same. So no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, with the two ester groups on opposite sides (cis or trans? Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, right? Because maleic acid is cis, and fumaric is trans. So the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, no: fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So when esterified, the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides. So the molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides, making it a geometric isomer. But the question is about optical isomerism. Can this compound have chiral centers?

Wait, the molecule is dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Now, looking for chiral centers. Each of the carbons in the double bond (the central two carbons) are connected via a double bond, so they can’t be chiral. The other carbons are CH2 and COOCH3. So the CH2 groups are attached to two H's, so they can't be chiral. So does this molecule have any chiral centers? I don't think so. Because all the carbons are either in a double bond or attached to same groups. So it can't have a chiral center. Wait, but maybe the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. Wait, wait, no, because in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is chiral? Or is it not?

Wait, no. Let me think. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. If the molecule is symmetric, it won't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the molecule is a meso compound, it's achiral even if it has stereogenic centers but has an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is trans, meaning the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. How is this arranged? Let's imagine the double bond as CH2-CH. The two CH2 groups would be on opposite sides. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry down the middle, making it achiral. Because the substituents on each side mirror each other. So in this case, dimethyl fumarate might not have chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each end are different. Wait, each end has a CH2 group and two ester groups. But wait, each CH2 is attached to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. No, the double bond is between two CH groups, each of which has two ester groups attached. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2?

Wait no, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH2CH(COOCH3)2), but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2CH2 where each CH has two COOCH3 groups? No, I think the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Oh wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would have two methyl groups esterifying each COOH. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the CH groups in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, wait, CH2=CH(COOCH3)2 would have each CH in the double bond connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of those CH groups is CH(COOCH3)2, but connected via a double bond. So each of these carbons has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a single bond to another CH group. Hmm, but wait, each of those carbons is connected to two ester groups, a double bond (so no substituent), and a CH group. So each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups, one CH group, and a double bond. So that's three substituents, but a double bond is a substituent in terms of geometry, but for a chiral center, you need four different groups. Since each of those carbons is part of a double bond, they cannot be chiral centers. So the dimethyl fumarate molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I thought fumarate could have some kind of isomerism. Oh, wait, maybe I was confusing it with another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole is achiral because of symmetry. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, if you look down the double bond, the groups are arranged trans, but the molecule itself might have a plane of symmetry. So it's a meso compound? No, wait, meso compounds have stereogenic centers but are achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereogenic centers because the atoms in the double bond aren't chiral. So no, there's no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the molecule has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, can that lead to a chiral arrangement? For example, if the substituents on each side are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. But without a chiral center, can the molecule itself be chiral? I think that without a chiral center, the molecule can't be chiral. Because chirality requires a chiral center (or some other forms like allenes, but I'm not sure if that applies here). So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so it's achiral.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric. Each of the two CH groups (in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Because of the trans configuration, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So the two halves mirror each other, making the molecule achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, let's recap the options:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Are there any chiral centers here? I'm unsure. Maybe the substituents on the biphenyls lead to a chiral center.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, it has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option 4 might not have any chiral centers, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again about option 1.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Let's imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at C1. Each ring has a nitro group at C6 and an ester group at C2.

So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So each of those carbons (C2 and C6) has a substituent. The C2 of each ring has an ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and C6 has a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the C2 and C6 carbons themselves could be chiral centers. Let's check.

Take the C2 on the first ring. It's connected to:

- The ring (two adjacent carbons)
- The ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- The nitro group at C6.

Wait, no, each C2 is bonded to two other ring carbons, the ester group, and perhaps what else? Wait, each carbon in a benzene ring is bonded to three other ring carbons (in a hexagon) and one substituent. So, the C2 in the first ring has substituents: the ester group, and the two adjacent ring carbons. Wait, but each ring carbon in benzene has only one substituent, right? Because benzene is a six-membered ring. So each C2 has the ester group, and the two adjacent C1 and C3. So, for the C2 on ring A, it's connected to:

- The ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- C1 (connected to the other ring)
- C3 (another ring carbon)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no, benzene is a planar structure with each carbon bonded to two adjacent carbons and one substituent. So, the C2 would have two adjacent ring carbons (C1 and C3), a substituent (ester group), and one hydrogen. So, that's four groups: two ring carbons (same), ester, and hydrogen. Are the two ring carbons considered the same? Because the ring is symmetric, perhaps each C2 is attached to two identical groups (the two adjacent ring carbons). So, the carbon at C2 would have three substituents: two identical ring carbons, an ester, and a hydrogen. So, the groups are not all different, so it's not a chiral center.

Similarly, the C6 has a nitro group, two adjacent ring carbons, and a hydrogen. So again, two identical substituents (the ring carbons), a nitro, and a hydrogen. So the substituents aren't all different. Hence, no chiral centers here.

So, the first compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then it would be achiral. So in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are symmetric positions. So the molecule as a whole would be symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism here.

So, putting it all together:

Which options have compounds that show optical isomerism?

- 1: No
- 2: Yes
- 3: No
- 4: No

So the only one that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, according to my analysis, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the choices, there is no option that only includes 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4: includes 2, so maybe I was wrong about 4.

Wait, did I make a mistake in analyzing option 4?

Wait, option 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Earlier I thought it doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But wait, each of the carbons in the double bond (CH and CH) has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each of those carbons is attached to:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- One CH2 group (maybe)
Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two CH groups in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups attached.

So, each of those CH groups has two ester groups, the double bond, and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, which can be written as CH2-CH2 where each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. No, perhaps it's:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3 ?

No, perhaps I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
   ||
    C

Wait, perhaps not. I think the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the CH groups is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, each of the CH groups has the same substituents: two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So, each of these CH groups is connected to two identical groups (COOCH3), the double bond, and a single bond to another CH group. So, each of these carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group (twice)
- A double bond (so not a substituent; it's part of the double bond)
- A single bond to another carbon.

Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents: two COOCH3 groups and one other CH group. Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group (if it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2). So, each of those carbons would have three substituents: two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. So, four substituents? Wait, no, each carbon in a double bond is connected to two other carbons (the double bond), and two substituents. So, in this case, each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each has two identical substituents (two COOCH3), a double bond, and a CH2 group. Wait, but each of these CH groups is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a CH group (the other end of the double bond). So, substituents are: COOCH3 (twice), CH. So, three substituents. But for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So, each of these CH groups only has three substituents, so they can't be chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I've read before that fumarate has geometric isomerism, but that's about the double bond configuration, not optical isomerism. So, I think I was correct in my earlier conclusion.

So, only option 2 shows optical isomerism.

Looking back at the choices, the options are:

A) 1,2 and 4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are no
B) 3 and 4 → no
C) 2 and 3 → no, 3 is no
D) 1 and 2 → no, 1 is no

Wait, none of the options match this. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, no, because the molecule doesn't have any carbon with four different substituents. So, perhaps the only correct answer is option 2, but the given options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let's re-examine it.

Dimethyl fumarate: Structure is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

Wait, each of the CH groups in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and a single bond to the other CH group. So each CH has two identical substituents (the COOCH3 groups), the other CH group, and a double bond. So the substituents are: two COOCH3, one CH, and a double bond. Wait, but in reality, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond (so part of the structure), and a single bond to another CH. So, each of these CHs has:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- One CH group (from the double bond)
- A double bond (which is just a bond, not a substituent)

So, each has three substituents: two COOCH3 and one CH. So, no, they don't have four different substituents. Hence, no chiral centers. So, I'm confident that option 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

So, the only option that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

But looking at the options given, none of the options have only option 2. Let's look at the options again:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, which is correct, but 1 and 4 are not. So this option would include 2, but since 1 and 4 are incorrect, the option is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of option 1.

Let me go back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected at C1). Each ring has a nitro group at C6 and an ester (COOCH3) at C2.

So, the molecule is symmetric. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 is correct. But looking at the choices, none of the options have only option 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2 and 4, which I think neither of them are correct except 2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, no, because the structure is symmetrical. Each of the CH groups in the double bond has two ester groups, making them identical. So each CH doesn't have four different substituents. So, no chiral centers.

Hmm, perhaps I'm forgetting another possibility. Wait, perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl in option 1 lead to a chiral center at the central carbon (C1). But wait, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, so each ring's C1 is connected to the other ring's C1. So, the substituents on each C1 would be two phenyl groups, a nitro, and an ester?

Wait, no, each C1 is part of the ring. So, each C1 is connected to three ring carbons and the other ring's C1. So, each C1 has three ring carbons and a single bond to the other C1. So, four substituents: three ring carbons and the other C1.

Wait, but if the substituents on the two rings are such that each C1 has different groups, then maybe it's a chiral center. Let me think: each C1 is connected to two substituents on its own ring (the nitro and ester groups at C2 and C6), but perhaps that's not directly connected to the C1.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should instead rely on my initial analysis. So, only option 2 shows optical isomerism.

Looking back, the correct answer would be option 2 is the only one that shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the question asks which of the moieties show optical isomerism. So I need to find which of the four have at least one chiral center.

1. No chiral center, no optical isomerism.

2. Yes, has a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So the only correct option is option 2.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are incorrect.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, none of the options list only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps in option 4, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound.

Wait, no, because meso compounds have stereogenic centers but are achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereogenic centers because the double bond carbons can't be chiral centers. So no, it's not a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Maybe it's the other way around: the structure is (Z)-dimethyl fumarate, which would have the ester groups on the same side. But that would make it a cis diastereomer, but regardless, without a chiral center, it won't have optical isomerism.

So, I think the only correct option is that only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), but I've determined that 1 and 4 do not.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, another thought: maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. Like, perhaps the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, no, the ester groups are on the same carbon in the structure. So, perhaps the carbon adjacent to the ester is a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the CH groups in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. The other carbons, perhaps, are CH2 groups, which can't be chiral. So, no, I don't think there's a chiral center.

Wait, maybe there's a stereogenic center elsewhere in the molecule. For example, perhaps the esterification process creates a stereogenic center. But no, the ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical.

So, I'm confident that only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Therefore, looking at the given options, none of them list only option 2. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of option 1. Let me think again. If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it could have a chiral center.

In option 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, but if the substituents are in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, perhaps a chiral center exists.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) has substituents that make it a chiral center. Let me think: the central carbon (C1 of each ring) is connected to two phenyl groups, a nitro group (from C6?), and an ester group (from C2?).

Wait, no, the substituents are at C2 and C6 of each ring, not directly on the central C1. So the central C1 is part of the benzene rings, so it's connected to three other carbons in the ring and the other ring's C1. So, in that case, the central C1 isn't a chiral center because it's part of a symmetric structure.

So, I think option 1 doesn't have any chiral centers.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2. But looking at the options, the options don't include a choice with only 2. So perhaps I made an error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is not symmetrical. Wait, but if the ester groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, suppose the molecule is such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Then, when mirrored, it would not look the same. Would that make the molecule chiral? Because without a chiral center, but with an overall asymmetry, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but can a molecule without any chiral centers be chiral? Yes, if it has a plane of asymmetry elsewhere. For example, meso compounds have chirality due to symmetry. No, wait, meso compounds are achiral because they have an internal plane of symmetry, making them achiral despite having stereogenic centers. But can a molecule without stereogenic centers be chiral?

Yes. For example, allenes can be chiral without having a stereogenic center. But in this case, dimethyl fumarate is an E diene ester. The question is whether the molecule itself is chiral due to its structure, even without a stereogenic center.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the example of tartaric acid. The meso form is achiral despite having two stereogenic centers. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the molecule is chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry, even without a stereogenic center.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll have to make a decision based on what I know.

Based on my analysis, only option 2 has a chiral center. So the correct answer is option 2. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D. Option A includes 1,2,4; D includes 1 and 2.

Since I've determined that option 1 doesn't have a chiral center, I think the correct answer is only option 2. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. If the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, then it can't have optical isomerism. So, I think option 4 is incorrect.

So, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D. But since I thought 1 is incorrect, and 4 is incorrect, perhaps none of the options are correct. But that's unlikely; perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1. Let me think about the biphenyl structure. Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, for the biphenyl, each ring's substituents are at opposite positions. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral.

Therefore, only option 2 is correct. But the given options don't have an option with just 2. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but that would mean I made a mistake in my analysis of options 1 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my analysis of option 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. The two ester groups are on opposite sides. So, each of the CH groups in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a CH group. So, each of these CH groups has three substituents. So, no, not four different groups. So, no chiral center.

Thus, the correct answer is only option 2, but since the options don't include that, I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about which compounds have stereogenic centers.

1. Biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring: No stereogenic centers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, the central carbon is a stereogenic center.

3. Benzophenone: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No.

So, only option 2 has a stereogenic center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options again:

A) 1,2,4 → 2 is correct, others incorrect.

B) 3,4 → incorrect.

C) 2,3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D) 1,2 → both incorrect.

Wait, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that option 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again about option 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two CH groups in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH has two identical substituents, a double bond, and a single bond to another CH. So, each CH has three substituents, meaning no chiral center.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option 2, but since it's not an option, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether any of the compounds have any kind of isomerism, including geometric or others. But the question specifically asks about optical isomerism, which relates to chiral centers.

So, the only one is option 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1. Let's think: perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that causes the molecule to have a chiral center on the biphenyl. Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the same side, causing a chiral center on the central carbon.

Wait, in a biphenyl system, the connecting carbon (C1) has two phenyl groups attached (from each ring), but perhaps the substituents on the rings (ester and nitro groups) create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the carbons at positions 2 and 6 on each ring are connected to four different groups, making them chiral centers.

Let me think about the carbon at position 2 on ring A. It is connected to:

- The ring (two adjacent carbons)
- The ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- The nitro group (NO2) at position 6.

Wait, no, the nitro group is on position 6 of ring A. So, the carbon at position 2 is connected to:

- The ring (two adjacent carbons)
- The ester group at C2
- The nitro group at C6 is on the same ring, but not directly connected to C2. Wait, no, each carbon in a benzene ring is bonded to only one substituent. So, the carbon at position 2 is connected to the ester group, and the adjacent carbons in the ring. The nitro group is at position 6, which is three carbons away in the ring. So, the carbon at position 2 has:

- Two adjacent ring carbons (C1 and C3)
- The ester group
- A hydrogen.

So, substituents are: two ring carbons (which are identical because the ring is symmetrical), ester, and H. Therefore, not four different substituents. So, no chiral center.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only compound that shows optical isomerism is option 2. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes option 2 and others, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is different. Maybe it's a four-carbon chain with ester groups on C2 and C3. So, something like CH2-COOCH3 on both ends, with a double bond in between. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2 where each CH2 has an ester group. Wait, no, I think the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

In that structure, each of the CH groups in the double bond has two ester groups, a double bond, and a CH group. So, no chiral centers.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option 2 only, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes option 2 and others, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again: maybe the structure is such that the two ester groups are on the same carbon, but in such a way that it creates a chiral center.

Wait, for example, if the structure is (CH2CH2(COOCH3)2), but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane or something else. No, I think I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the only correct option is option 2, and since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes option 2.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2 and 4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and3

D)1 and 2

So, the only option that includes 2 is A and D. But since I think 1 is incorrect, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another angle. The question is about which moieties show optical isomerism. So, if a compound has any stereoisomerism other than geometric, it's included.

Wait, another approach: only compounds with chiral centers will show optical isomerism.

- 2: yes, chiral center → optical isomerism.

- 4: No.

- 1: No.

- 3: No.

So, only 2 is correct. But the options don't include this, so perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but considering the options, perhaps option A is intended.

But I think I've made a mistake because the correct answer should only be option 2. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate option 4 once more. Could it have a chiral center?

If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2, then each CH has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a CH2 group. So, each CH has three substituents, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two ester groups are on different carbons, creating a chiral center. For example, if the structure is CH2CH2 where each CH is connected to one COOCH3 group, making one CH have two COOCH3 groups and another substituent.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Its dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the CH groups in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a CH2 group. So, again, no chiral centers.

Thus, I think I'll have to settle on option 2 being the only correct one, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1. Let me think again: the biphenyl structure with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Could this cause a chiral center elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and ester groups are on opposite sides of the ring, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Hmm, I think I've spent enough time. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is only option 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the biphenyl in option 1 has a chiral center because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if the substituents are on adjacent positions, causing the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

In option 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has an ester at 2 and a nitro at 6. If the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents are not symmetrical, then perhaps the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to a chiral center at the central carbon.

Wait, but the central carbon is part of both rings and thus connected to two phenyl groups, so it can't be a chiral center. So, I don't think option 1 has a chiral center.

Thus, the correct answer must be option 2 only, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer intended is option A (1,2,4). But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision. Based on my analysis, the only correct answer is option 2, but since it's not listed, perhaps the intended answer is option A. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center in the ester groups. Wait, each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The OCH3 is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl, so that's not a chiral center either.

Thus, I think the only correct answer is option 2, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But, given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has at least one chiral center, defined as a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The central carbon (C1) connecting the two rings is bonded to two phenyl groups, a nitro group, and an ester group. However, the substituents on the C1 carbon are not all different (two phenyl groups are identical), so no chiral center exists. Additionally, the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, an ester group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. All four groups are different, making this carbon a chiral center.  
   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   This compound, (Ph)2CO, has two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, leaving it with only three substituents (two phenyl groups and one oxygen). Since it does not have four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is also symmetric, making it achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**  
   The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical ester groups, a double bond, and a hydrogen. Since these carbons do not have four different groups, they are not chiral centers. The molecule is symmetric, making it achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
Only compound **2 (Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. However, none of the provided options correctly include only compound 2. Based on the given options, the closest match is **A (1, 2, 4)**, though it incorrectly includes compounds 1 and 4, which do not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Answer: A**
