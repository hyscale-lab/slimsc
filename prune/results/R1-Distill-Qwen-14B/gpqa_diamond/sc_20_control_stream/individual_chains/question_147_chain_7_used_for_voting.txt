Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other to produce two A+ and two A- particles. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. 

The given information is that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe I can assume that its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the velocity of the antiproton. Wait, no, the question is asking for the velocity of particle A. Oh right, so the velocity we're looking for is that of particles A.

The mass of A is given: m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, that's the rest mass energy. So the rest mass of A is 300 MeV/c². 

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can model this as a process where the total energy is shared among the products. But wait, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Proton and antiproton have the same mass, m_p = m_p̄, right? And their rest mass energy is about 938 MeV each. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So perhaps the initial total energy is approximately 2 * m_p c², but wait, that's if both are at rest. But in reality, one is moving, so I need to think carefully.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So if it's moving at a low speed, its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. So perhaps we can approximate its total energy as just m_p c². But the proton is incoming at rest? Or is it the antiproton that's moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So the setup is probably that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with a small velocity. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify which one is moving. Wait, the question states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a slow speed. So in the lab frame, the proton is stationary, and the antiproton has some low velocity.

Wait, but for the annihilation process, the total energy and momentum must be considered. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So the total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. But wait, the proton is at rest: its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its total energy is gamma m_p c², but since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but maybe even just 1 for a rough estimate. So the total energy is about 2 m_p c².

But the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. So two positively charged and two negatively charged. Wait, but the charges must balance, so maybe that's not the point here. The question is about the velocity of A.

So the total energy has to be conserved. The initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's energy. Since the antiproton is moving, but slowly, maybe its energy is approximately m_p c², making the total initial energy about 2 m_p c². The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Wait, but each A has energy given by gamma m_A c², where gamma depends on their velocity.

But wait, the annihilated particles (proton and antiproton) have rest mass about 938 MeV each. So 2 m_p c² is about 1876 MeV, but the products are four particles, each with rest mass 300 MeV. So 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Wait, but the initial energy is 1876 MeV, which is larger than 1200 MeV, so some kinetic energy is present in the products.

But wait, since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is low. Let me think about momentum conservation. The initial system has the proton at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with some momentum p. So the total initial momentum is p. After annihilation, the four A particles must carry this momentum. But if they're moving in some direction, their total momentum must equal the initial p.

Assuming all A particles are moving in the same direction, which may not be the case, but perhaps for simplicity, let's suppose they're all moving in the same direction. Wait, but with four particles, it's more likely they are moving in different directions, but maybe symmetrically. But perhaps the problem is assuming that the A particles are all moving with the same speed, which is a big assumption. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So if all four A particles are moving with the same velocity u, then each has momentum gamma m_A u. The total momentum would be 4 gamma m_A u. But the initial momentum is the antiproton's momentum, which is gamma_p m_p v_p. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is much less than c, so gamma_p ≈1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

So, setting 4 gamma m_A u = m_p v_p.

Wait, but we also have energy conservation. The initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c². Again, since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈1 + (v_p²)/(2c²). So E_initial ≈ m_p c² (1 + 1) )= 2 m_p c².

Wait, but wait, the antiproton is moving, so its energy is gamma_p m_p c². So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c². But if the antiproton's speed is slow, gamma_p is close to 1, so E_initial is approximately 2 m_p c², as I thought.

On the final side, each A has energy gamma m_A c². So four of them contribute 4 gamma m_A c².

So energy conservation: 4 gamma m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

So gamma = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A ) ) = m_p/(2 m_A )

Wait, substituting the numbers, m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c². So m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(2*300) ≈ 938 /600 ≈ 1.563. So gamma is about 1.563.

So each A is moving with gamma = 1.563. Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), where beta is v/c. So 1.563 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64. Then 1 - beta² = (0.64)^2 ≈ 0.4096. So beta squared is 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904. So beta is sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768. So v ≈ 0.768 c.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close. But wait, maybe I made some approximations. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c². So m_p/(2 m_A) = (938)/(2 *300)= 938/600 ≈ 1.5633. So gamma ≈ 1.5633.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 is (1.5633)^2 ≈ 2.443.

So 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.409. So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. Sqrt of that is about 0.769, which is about 0.77c. So option A is 0.77c, which would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm assuming all four particles A are moving with the same velocity. Is that a valid assumption? Because in reality, when particles collide, the products can move in various directions, but given that the initial momentum is along one direction (the antiproton's), maybe the products share that momentum in some symmetric way. But maybe the question is assuming that all four are moving in the same direction, so that the total momentum is simply 4 times each's momentum. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the system's total momentum is zero, but that's not the case here because the proton was at rest and the antiproton was moving. So the initial momentum is non-zero.

Hmm, but wait, another approach is to consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But in this problem, since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is about m_p v_p (since the proton is at rest), so the lab frame is the proton's rest frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible because the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p is much smaller than c. Therefore, the initial momentum is m_p v_p, which is much smaller than the rest energy terms.

Wait, but I think my initial approach was correct. So the velocity of each A is about 0.77c, which would correspond to option A.

But let me think again about the momentum. The initial momentum is that of the antiproton: p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p. Since v_p is small, gamma_p ~1, and p_initial ≈ m_p v_p. On the final side, each A has momentum gamma m_A v, where v is their velocity. Assuming all four have the same velocity and direction, then the total final momentum is 4 gamma m_A v.

So 4 gamma m_A v = m_p v_p.

But from energy, we have 4 gamma m_A c² = 2 m_p c². So gamma = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A ) ) = m_p/(2 m_A ) ≈ 1.563.

So, substituting gamma into the momentum equation: 4 * (m_p/(2 m_A )) * m_A v = m_p v_p.

Simplify: 4 * (m_p/(2 m_A )) * m_A v = 2 m_p v = m_p v_p.

So 2 v = v_p.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p much less than c. So v is approximately (v_p)/2, which is much less than c. But wait, this contradicts our earlier result where v is 0.77c. So there must be a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, I think I messed up the momentum calculation. Let me re-express the momentum equation.

From momentum conservation: sum of initial momenta = sum of final momenta.

Initial momentum is all from the antiproton, which is moving. The proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. So p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p. Since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

Final momentum: each A has momentum gamma m_A v. But since the initial momentum is in one direction, the A particles must have their momenta summing to that. However, it's possible that the four A particles are moving in different directions, so their momenta don't all add up in the same direction. But without knowing the directions, perhaps we have to make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, so each A has the same speed but in different directions, but the momentum vectors sum up to the initial momentum.

Hmm, this complicates things. Maybe a better approach is to consider that the initial momentum is small compared to the rest mass terms, so the products' velocities are determined primarily by energy conservation.

Wait, but from the earlier energy calculation, we had gamma = 1.563, leading to v ~0.77c. However, when considering the momentum, that would give a higher momentum than the initial p_initial. So perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that all four A particles are moving in the same direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible compared to the rest mass momentum, so we can neglect it. But the problem says the antiproton is moving, so its momentum can't be completely neglected. Hmm.

Wait, maybe instead of assuming all four A particles are moving in the same direction, we can imagine that the problem is symmetric, so perhaps two A+ and two A- are moving in opposite directions, each pair with some velocity. But then it's unclear how to model the momentum. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric in such a way that the total momentum is zero. But that would only happen if the initial momentum is zero, which isn't the case here because the antiproton is moving.

Wait, perhaps the four A particles are moving in pairs in opposite directions, but with the same speed. So for each pair, their momenta cancel each other, but that would only happen if the momentum vectors cancel. But the initial system has a net momentum, so that can't be. So perhaps the four A particles must move in such a way that their total momentum equals the initial momentum.

But without knowing the directions, this seems complicated. Maybe the question assumes that all A particles are moving in the same direction, which leads to the earlier calculation of v ≈0.77c. But then the momentum equation would require 4 gamma m_A v = m_p v_p.

But from the energy equation, we found gamma=1.563, and from that, v≈0.77c. So substituting into the momentum equation:

4 * 1.563 * 300 MeV/c² * 0.77c = m_p v_p.

Wait, let's compute the left side:

4 * 1.563 * 300 * 0.77 = 4 * 1.563 * 300 *0.77 = Let's compute 1.563 *300 = 468.9; then 468.9 *0.77 ≈ 361.45; then 4 * 361.45 ≈ 1445.8.

So left side is 1445.8 (units: MeV/c² * c) → 1445.8 MeV/c * c → 1445.8 MeV.

Right side is m_p v_p. m_p is 938 MeV/c². So 938 MeV/c² * v_p = 1445.8 MeV.

Solving for v_p: v_p = (1445.8 MeV) / (938 MeV/c²) ) * c² → (1445.8 /938) * c.

Wait, 1445.8 /938 ≈1.54. So v_p ≈1.54 c.

But that's impossible because v_p can't be greater than c. So that suggests a mistake in the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Because that gives a v_p greater than c, which is impossible.

Hmm, so clearly that approach is wrong. So perhaps I can't assume all A particles are moving in the same direction. Maybe some are moving forward and others backward, but that complicates the momentum calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the problem in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. Let me think about that.

In the CM frame, the total momentum is zero. So in that frame, the initial momentum of the antiproton is balanced by the proton's momentum. But wait, the proton is at rest in the lab frame. So how to find the CM frame?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial energy is about 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is m_p v_p. So the total energy in the lab frame is E = 2 m_p c² and the momentum is p = m_p v_p.

The energy in the CM frame is sqrt( (E)^2 - (p c)^2 ), which would be the sum of the rest masses of the products, because in the CM frame, all kinetic energy is converted into rest mass. Wait, but the products are four A particles. So the total rest mass in the CM frame is 4 m_A c².

So in the CM frame:

E_cm = sqrt( (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v_p c)^2 ) = 4 m_A c².

Wait, that's an equation we can solve for v_p.

So let's write:

(2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v_p c )^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4:

(2 m_p )^2 - (m_p v_p )^2 = (4 m_A )^2.

So (2 m_p)^2 - (4 m_A )^2 = (m_p v_p )^2.

Compute left-hand side: (2 m_p)^2 - (4 m_A )^2.

m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So (2*938)^2 = (1876)^2 = let's compute 1876²: approximately 3,519, 000 (since 1800² is 3,240,000; 1876² = (1800 +76)^2 = 1800² + 2*1800*76 +76² = 3,240,000 + 273,600 + 5,776 = 3,519,376).

(4 m_A )^2 = (1200)^2 = 1,440,000.

So left-hand side is 3,519,376 - 1,440,000 = 2,079,376 (MeV²/c^4).

So (m_p v_p )^2 = 2,079,376 MeV²/c^4.

Take square root: m_p v_p = sqrt(2,079,376) ≈ 1442 MeV/c.

So v_p = (1442 MeV/c) / (938 MeV/c² ) * c² → (1442 / 938) * c ≈ 1.537 c.

Wait, that's even worse. v_p can't be greater than c. So this suggests that the assumption that the entire initial energy goes into the rest mass of the products in the CM frame might not hold, or perhaps the approach is flawed.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the energy equation. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

In the CM frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the products, since all particles are produced at rest in the CM frame. So E_cm = (4 m_A ) c².

But E_cm is calculated from the lab frame (where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving) as sqrt( (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 ).

So E_lab is the total energy in the lab frame, which is E = m_p c² (proton rest) + gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton's energy). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p²)/(2 c² ), but for small v_p, gamma_p ≈ 1. So E_lab ≈ 2 m_p c².

p_lab is the momentum of the antiproton, which is gamma_p m_p v_p. Again, since v_p is small, p_lab ≈ m_p v_p.

So E_cm = sqrt( (2 m_p c² )^2 - (m_p v_p c )^2 ) = 4 m_A c^2.

So, (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v_p c )^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4:

(2 m_p )^2 - (m_p v_p )^2 = (4 m_A )^2.

So,

(2 m_p )^2 - (4 m_A )^2 = (m_p v_p )^2.

Compute this:

(2 *938)^2 = 1876^2 = 3,519,376 (MeV² / c^4 )

(4 * 300 )^2 = 1200^2 = 1,440,000.

So,

3,519,376 - 1,440,000 = 2,079,376 = (938 v_p )^2.

Take square root: 938 v_p = sqrt(2,079,376) ≈ 1442.

So v_p ≈ 1442 /938 ≈ 1.537 c.

Again, which is impossible. So this suggests that the initial assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly leads to a contradiction, which probably isn't the case. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the CM frame's rest mass is 4 m_A c². But that's only true if all four A particles are at rest in the CM frame. But that's not the case because when they are produced, they have kinetic energy, so their total energy would be greater than 4 m_A c².

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame, considering that the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p, and the proton is at rest.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

After the annihilation, four A particles are produced with energies E_A each. Let's assume each A has the same speed u, but perhaps their directions are such that their momenta sum up to p_initial. But in reality, without knowing the directions, it's difficult.

But perhaps the problem is symmetric in some way, leading all four A particles to move in a symmetric fashion, such that their momenta add up to p_initial. Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, which might not be the case, but let's proceed with this assumption to see where it leads.

So, each A has energy E_A = gamma m_A c², where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)).

The total energy is 4 gamma m_A c² = E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² (since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈1).

So,

4 gamma m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A ) = m_p/(2 m_A ) = 938/(600) ≈ 1.563.

So gamma ≈ 1.563.

Then, from gamma, we can find the velocity u.

gamma = 1.563 = 1/sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)) → sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.64 → 1 - (u²/c²) = 0.4096 → u²/c² = 0.5904 → u/c ≈ 0.769 → u ≈ 0.769 c.

Now, considering momentum: each A has momentum gamma m_A u.

Total momentum from the four A's is 4 gamma m_A u.

Set this equal to the initial momentum, which is gamma_p m_p v_p.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

Thus:

4 gamma m_A u = m_p v_p.

Substituting gamma = 1.563 and u ≈0.769 c:

4 *1.563 *300 MeV/c² * 0.769 c ≈ m_p v_p.

Compute the left side:

4 *1.563 =6.252; 6.252 *300 =1875.6; 1875.6 *0.769 ≈ 1443.9 MeV/c.

So 1443.9 MeV/c ≈ m_p v_p.

But m_p is 938 MeV/c². So,

v_p = (1443.9 MeV/c) / (938 MeV/c² ) ) * c² → (1443.9 /938 ) * c ≈ 1.54c.

Again, v_p exceeds c, which is impossible. So this suggests that the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should consider that the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum, but their energies sum to the initial energy. So, perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs in opposite directions, but with the same speed.

Let me suppose that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, and two are moving in the opposite direction. Let's say each of the two forward A's has velocity u, and each of the two backward A's has velocity u in the opposite direction. Then the total momentum would be 2 gamma m_A u (from the forward) minus 2 gamma m_A u (from the backward), but that would cancel out. That can't be right. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the A's are moving symmetrically in pairs, such that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. For example, two A's moving in the same direction with velocity u, and two moving with velocity v in another direction. But this complicates the calculation a lot, and I'm not sure how to proceed without more information.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial assumption and think: the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So, the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v_p, where v_p << c.

The final energy is 4 gamma m_A c², and the final momentum is 4 gamma m_A u, but only if all four are moving in the same direction. However, this leads to v_p exceeding c, which is impossible. So, perhaps the problem is designed such that the A particles share the momentum in a way that their velocities are lower.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in considering that all four A particles have the same speed. What if they have different speeds? But without knowing their directions or speeds, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the A particles move in a way that their momentum vectors cancel each other except for the initial momentum.

This is getting too complicated, and perhaps the intended approach is the initial one, leading to 0.77c, so option A. But since the earlier momentum calculation led to v_p > c, which is impossible, perhaps the assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect, and the problem requires another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the total initial energy being about 2 m_p c² is incorrect. Because the antiproton is moving, its energy is higher than its rest mass. So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c². Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c² ). But for small v_p, gamma_p is approximately 1, so E_initial is about 2 m_p c². But perhaps a better approximation would be to include the kinetic energy. For example, E_initial = m_p c² + (m_p c² + K_p ), where K_p is the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, K_p << m_p c², so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + K_p. But perhaps K_p is negligible compared to the rest energy, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But then, as before, the momentum from the A's would require v_p > c, which isn't possible. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial momentum is small compared to the rest mass terms, so the velocity of A can be found using energy conservation alone. Let's try that.

So, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma m_A c² → gamma = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A )= m_p/(2 m_A ) ≈ 1.563.

From gamma, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma² )) = sqrt(1 - (1/(2.443))) ≈ sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.769, so v ≈0.769c, which is option A.

But the momentum equation gives a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the momentum and only use energy conservation, leading to option A. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the A particles are all moving in a way that the momentum is negligible, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the initial system's momentum is zero. Which would be the case if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving towards it, making the initial momentum non-zero.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended approach is to use energy conservation, leading to v≈0.77c, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the velocity of particle \( A \) in the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy, and we approximate its total energy as \( \gamma_p m_p c^2 \), where \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \) due to the low velocity.

### Key Information:
1. Rest mass energy of the proton (or antiproton): \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).
2. Rest mass energy of particle \( A \): \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
3. Initial energy: \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2 \) (since \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \)).
4. Final energy: \( E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma m_A c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for particle \( A \).

### Energy Conservation:
Equating the initial and final energies:
\[
2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
\gamma = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
\]
Substitute \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} = \frac{938}{600} \approx 1.563
\]

### Relating \( \gamma \) to Velocity:
The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
Substitute \( \gamma = 1.563 \):
\[
\gamma^2 = (1.563)^2 \approx 2.443
\]
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904
\]
\[
v/c = \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.769
\]
Thus:
\[
v \approx 0.769c
\]

### Momentum Considerations:
The initial momentum is approximately \( p_{\text{initial}} = m_p v_p \), where \( v_p \) is the velocity of the slow-moving antiproton. The final momentum is shared among the four \( A \)-particles. However, the problem simplifies by assuming energy conservation alone, as the exact momentum distribution among the \( A \)-particles is not specified.

### Conclusion:
Using energy conservation, the velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
