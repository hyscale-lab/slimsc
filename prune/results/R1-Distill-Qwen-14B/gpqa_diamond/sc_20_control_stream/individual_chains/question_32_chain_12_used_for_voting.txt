Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means 3 protons. But if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy; it's also kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy, E_rest. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

Gamma is calculated by 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c squared. Then (v²/c²) is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Let me check that calculation again to be accurate. Oh wait, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... yeah, around 3.5714.

Now, the rest energy E_rest is the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and same for each neutron. So one proton is 938.272 MeV (I think the exact value is around 938.272 MeV, but maybe I should use 938.272 for more precision).

Wait, let me double-check that. I remember the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c². Neutrons are slightly heavier, around 939.565 MeV/c². Oh, wait, that's a key point. So I can't just use the same mass for protons and neutrons. So each proton is 938.272 MeV, and each neutron is 939.565 MeV. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass energy is 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565). Let me calculate that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.
Adding them together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So E_rest is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV).

Wait, but wait a second. When you have a nucleus like Li-6, the actual mass is a little less than the sum of individual nucleons because of binding energy. Oh, but wait no, in nuclear physics, the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But in this case, since the problem is giving us the nucleus as Li with 3 neutrons, I think we're supposed to assume that the mass is the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Or wait, perhaps not. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion.

Wait, no. The rest mass of the nucleus is actually less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because some mass is converted into binding energy. But wait, for the purpose of calculating the rest energy, in particle physics, the rest mass is the actual mass of the nucleus. So perhaps in this problem, we can calculate the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or maybe the problem expects us to use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 isotope, which is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons, but taking into account any binding energy. But I don't have exact values, so perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the rest mass using individual proton and neutron masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just calculate the rest mass as the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, considering each as 938 MeV. But considering that, I think I should proceed with that approach unless told otherwise.

Wait, but let me think again. The exact calculation would require the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check the atomic mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol per mole. But wait, the molar mass is 6.0141 g/mol, so each atom has a mass of 6.0141 / (Avogadro's number) grams. But converting that to atomic mass units, since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c² (because 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c²). Let me compute the mass of Li-6 in MeV/c².

So Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.0141 u. So 6.0141 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0141 * 931.5 ≈ Let's calculate that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589. So 0.0141 * 931.5 is about 13.13. So total is approximately 5589 +13.13 = 5602.13 MeV. So about 5.602 GeV. Wait, but earlier calculation using individual protons and neutrons (without binding) gave 5.633 GeV. So this is a bit lower, which makes sense because the binding energy reduces the rest mass.

So which one should I use? The problem says "the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons", which is Li-6. So perhaps I should take the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is approximately 5.602 GeV. But to get a precise value, I need the exact mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy. Let me see. If I use 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each as 938.272 and 939.565 respectively, then:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u, which is about 5.602 GeV. So the difference is about 0.0315 GeV, which is 31.5 MeV. Hmm, that's a significant difference. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Let me look it up. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01410255 u. So that's 6.01410255 * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that precisely.

6.01410255 * 931.5 = ?

Well, 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01410255 * 931.5 = 

Compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315
0.00410255 *931.5 ≈ 0.004 *931.5=3.726, plus 0.00010255*931.5≈0.0954. So total ~3.726 +0.0954=3.8214. So 0.01 part is 9.315, 0.00410255 is ~3.8214. So 9.315 +3.8214=13.1364 MeV.

So 5589 +13.1364 = 5602.1364 MeV. So 5.6021364 GeV.

Wait, but using the sum of individual nucleons (without considering binding energy) gives me about 5.6335 GeV, which is higher than the actual rest mass. So which one should I use for the rest energy?

The problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6. Therefore, I should use the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is 5.6021 GeV.

Alternatively, sometimes in problems, the rest mass is approximated as the sum of individual nucleon masses, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute it that way. Hmm.

But the problem is about calculating the energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. So I'll proceed either way, but perhaps I should go with the actual rest mass.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I should just use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as m, and proceed from there.

But without exact data, perhaps I should proceed with the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute both approaches and see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the rest mass of Li-6 from standard tables. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u, so 6.0141 *931.5 = 5.602 GeV.

So, E_rest is 5.602 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, as computed earlier. So E_total is gamma * E_rest = 3.5714 *5.602 GeV.

Calculating that: 3 *5.602 is 16.806. 0.5714 *5.602 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.602=2.801, 0.0714 *5.602≈0.402. So total 2.801 +0.402=3.203. So sum is 16.806 +3.203=20.009 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20.009 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069. Hmm, but wait, I must have made a mistake because my calculation gives around 20 GeV, but let's see.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of gamma.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

E_rest is 5.602 GeV.

Gamma * E_rest is 3.5714 *5.602 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.602.

Break it down:

3 *5.602 = 16.806.

0.5714 *5.602: Let's compute 0.5 *5.602=2.801.

0.0714 *5.602: 0.07 *5.602=0.39214, 0.0014 *5.602=0.0078428. So total 0.39214+0.0078428=0.3999828.

So 2.801 + 0.3999828 ≈ 3.20098.

Total is 16.806 +3.20098=20.00698 GeV, approximately 20.007 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But wait, my approximation may have been rough. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which would give E_rest as 5.6335 GeV.

Calculating gamma*E_rest: 3.5714 *5.6335.

Let me compute this accurately.

3 *5.6335 = 16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6335: Let's compute 0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.0714 *5.6335: 0.07 *5.6335=0.394345; 0.0014 *5.6335=0.007887. So 0.394345 +0.007887=0.402232.

So 2.81675 +0.402232=3.218982.

Adding to 16.9005: 16.9005 + 3.218982 = 20.119482 GeV, which is approximately 20.119 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

E_rest using sum of nucleon masses:

3 protons (3 *938.272 MeV) = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons (3 *939.565 MeV) = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me write it as 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

Compute 0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857 ≈ let's compute 5.633511 * (1/700) ≈ approximately 0.00804787.

So 0.39434577 +0.00804787 ≈ 0.40239364.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.633511 is 2.8167555 +0.40239364 =3.21914914.

So total E_total is 16.900533 +3.21914914 = 20.119682 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than what I calculated. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used more precise neutron and proton masses.

Wait, perhaps the exact values for proton and neutron masses are needed. Let me check.

The proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So 3 protons are 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 * 5.633511 = ?

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511 = Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.03 =0.107142857.

3.57142857 *0.003511≈0.0125619.

So 0.107142857 +0.0125619≈0.119704757.

So total for 0.633511: 2.142857142 +0.119704757 ≈2.2625619.

Now, add to the 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.2625619=20.11970475 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So that's the correct answer perhaps.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is 5.602 GeV, not the sum of the nucleons. If I do that, then E_total would be 3.5714 *5.602.

3.5714 *5.602 =?

3 *5.602=16.806.

0.5714 *5.602: 0.5 *5.602=2.801; 0.0714*5.602≈0.402.

So 2.801+0.402=3.203.

Total E=16.806 +3.203=20.009 GeV, which is about 20.009 GeV. But this is about 0.12 GeV less than the option C value.

Hmm, but the options include option C as 20.132, which is close to 20.1197 when using the sum of nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of individual masses, so option C is the correct answer.

Wait, I should think again: the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the rest mass is the actual mass of Li-6, which is 6.0141 u. So I should use that.

So with E_rest=5.602 GeV, and gamma=3.5714, so E_total=3.5714*5.602.

Wait, let me do that calculation precisely.

3.5714 *5.602.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.602 = ?

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.002 *3.5714=0.0071428.

So sum is 2.14284 +0.0071428=2.15.

So 3.5714 *5.602 =17.857 +2.15=20.007 GeV.

So approximately 20.007 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, but that's 0.125 GeV higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the rest mass more accurately. Let me get the exact value of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01410255 u. So E_rest =6.01410255 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01410255 *931.5.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01410255 *931.5 =?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00410255 *931.5= let's compute 0.004 *931.5=3.726, 0.00010255 *931.5≈0.0954.

So sum 3.726 +0.0954=3.8214.

So 9.315 +3.8214=13.1364 MeV.

Total E_rest is 5589 +13.1364 =5602.1364 MeV =5.6021364 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total =3.57142857 *5.6021364.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.6021364.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6021364.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0021364 *3.57142857 ≈ let's approximate it as 0.0076333.

So 2.142857142 +0.0076333 ≈2.15049.

So total E_total is 17.85714285 +2.15049 ≈20.0076 GeV.

So about 20.0076 GeV, which rounds to 20.008 GeV. Looking at the options, the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, but that's much higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should be using the rest mass in terms of protons and neutrons, but I think I’ve tried that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. But the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" which is typically the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), but sometimes people refer to it as kinetic energy. Hmm, that could be a mistake.

Wait, the problem statement says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy here is the total energy, because the speed is determined by the total energy. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the charge particles, like using the mass of a single nucleon, but I don't think that applies here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857. Correct.

So E_total=gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps the error is that I used the molar mass as 6.0141 u for Li-6, but perhaps the actual value is slightly different. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that Li-6 has a binding energy of about 2.7 MeV (per nucleon?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to about 20.1197 GeV, which is option C: 20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using more precise masses would get closer.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of free nucleons, so the rest mass is indeed the sum, leading to 5.6335 GeV, and then E_total is 3.5714 *5.6335 = approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.12 GeV, but the option C is 20.132, which is very close.

So given that, the correct answer would be option C: 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was using a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

Gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Wait, but 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.571428571.

So E_rest = sum of the individual masses, 5.633511 GeV.

E_total=3.571428571 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511.

Break it down:

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.571428571.

Compute 5.633511 *0.5=2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.071428571.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07=0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.001428571≈0.00804787.

So 0.39434577 +0.00804787=0.40239364.

So 2.8167555 +0.40239364=3.21914914.

So E_total=16.900533 +3.21914914=20.11968214 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. But that's a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would lead to a little higher value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

Wait, the exact proton mass is 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is 939.5654 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.5654=2818.6962 MeV.

Total E_rest= (2814.816 +2818.6962) MeV =5633.5122 MeV =5.6335122 GeV.

Gamma =3.571428571.

So E_total=3.571428571 *5.6335122 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.571428571 *5.6335122.

5.6335122 *3 =16.9005366.

5.6335122 *0.571428571.

Compute 0.5 *5.6335122=2.8167561.

0.071428571 *5.6335122.

Compute 0.07 *5.6335122=0.394345854.

0.001428571 *5.6335122≈0.00804789.

So sum: 0.394345854 +0.00804789=0.40239374.

So total for 0.571428571 *5.6335122=2.8167561 +0.40239374=3.21914984.

Add to 16.9005366: 16.9005366 +3.21914984=20.11968644 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

So again, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but my precise calculation gives about 20.1197. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option C is 20.132 GeV. Let me see if there's any other factor I missed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Because sometimes, in such contexts, people refer to the kinetic energy as the 'energy' of the collider.

The kinetic energy K is E_total - E_rest.

So E_total=gamma*mc².

K = (gamma-1)*mc².

In that case, if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then K would be (3.5714 -1)*5.6335 GeV.

Which is 2.5714 *5.6335 ≈ ?

2 *5.6335 = 11.267.

0.5714 *5.6335≈3.218.

So total K ≈14.485 GeV. But that's not near any of the options except perhaps option A, which is about 18 GeV, but not matching. So I think the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that the nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons, and perhaps the charge affects the energy, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in using the sum of the nucleon masses. Let me compute the rest mass using exact values.

Wait, let me find the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01410255 u.

So E_rest =6.01410255 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.01410255 *931.5 = let me compute this precisely.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01410255 *931.5 =?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00410255 *931.5=0.004 *931.5=3.726; 0.00010255 *931.5=0.0954.

So 3.726 +0.0954=3.8214.

So 9.315 +3.8214=13.1364.

So E_rest =5589 +13.1364=5602.1364 MeV=5.6021364 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total=3.57142857 *5.6021364.

Let me compute this in more detail.

5.6021364 *3 =16.8064092.

5.6021364 *0.57142857.

Compute 0.5 *5.6021364=2.8010682.

0.07142857 *5.6021364.

Compute 0.07 *5.6021364=0.392149548.

0.00142857 *5.6021364≈0.00803879.

So sum: 0.392149548 +0.00803879=0.400188338.

So 2.8010682 +0.400188338=3.2012565.

So E_total=16.8064092 +3.2012565=20.0076657 GeV≈20.0077 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.008 GeV, which doesn't match any option exactly. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.12 GeV, but the option is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise terms.

Wait, perhaps 1/sqrt(0.0784) is not exactly 3.57142857. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Compute 0.28^2=0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So with E_rest=5.6021364 GeV:

E_total =3.57142857 *5.6021364=20.007666 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to E_rest=5.6335 GeV, and E_total=20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Given that, I think the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)), the total rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 3 \cdot 938.272 + 3 \cdot 939.565 = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \cdot E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \cdot 5.6335 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated total energy (\( \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means 3 protons. But if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy; it's also kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy, E_rest. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

Gamma is calculated by 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c squared. Then (v²/c²) is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Let me check that calculation again to be accurate. Oh wait, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... yeah, around 3.5714.

Now, the rest energy E_rest is the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and same for each neutron. So one proton is 938.272 MeV (I think the exact value is around 938.272 MeV, but maybe I should use 938.272 for more precision).

Wait, let me double-check that. I remember the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c². Neutrons are slightly heavier, around 939.565 MeV/c². Oh, wait, that's a key point. So I can't just use the same mass for protons and neutrons. So each proton is 938.272 MeV, and each neutron is 939.565 MeV. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass energy is 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565). Let me calculate that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.
Adding them together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So E_rest is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV).

Wait, but wait a second. When you have a nucleus like Li-6, the actual mass is a little less than the sum of individual nucleons because of binding energy. Oh, but wait no, in nuclear physics, the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But in this case, since the problem is giving us the nucleus as Li with 3 neutrons, I think we're supposed to assume that the mass is the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Or wait, perhaps not. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion.

Wait, no. The rest mass of the nucleus is actually less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because some mass is converted into binding energy. But wait, for the purpose of calculating the rest energy, in particle physics, the rest mass is the actual mass of the nucleus. So perhaps in this problem, we can calculate the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or maybe the problem expects us to use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 isotope, which is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons, but taking into account any binding energy. But I don't have exact values, so perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the rest mass using individual proton and neutron masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just calculate the rest mass as the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, considering each as 938 MeV. But considering that, I think I should proceed with that approach unless told otherwise.

Wait, but let me think again. The exact calculation would require the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check the atomic mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol per mole. But wait, the molar mass is 6.0141 g/mol, so each atom has a mass of 6.0141 / (Avogadro's number) grams. But converting that to atomic mass units, since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c² (because 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c²). Let me compute the mass of Li-6 in MeV/c².

So Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.0141 u. So 6.0141 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0141 * 931.5 ≈ Let's calculate that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589. So 0.0141 * 931.5 is about 13.13. So total is approximately 5589 +13.13 = 5602.13 MeV. So about 5.602 GeV. Wait, but earlier calculation using individual protons and neutrons (without binding) gave 5.633 GeV. So this is a bit lower, which makes sense because the binding energy reduces the rest mass.

So which one should I use? The problem says "the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons", which is Li-6. So perhaps I should take the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is approximately 5.602 GeV. But to get a precise value, I need the exact mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy. Let me see. If I use 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each as 938.272 and 939.565 respectively, then:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u, which is about 5.602 GeV. So the difference is about 0.0315 GeV, which is 31.5 MeV. Hmm, that's a significant difference. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Let me look it up. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01410255 u. So that's 6.01410255 * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that precisely.

6.01410255 * 931.5 = ?

Well, 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01410255 * 931.5 = 

Compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315
0.00410255 *931.5 ≈ 0.004 *931.5=3.726, plus 0.00010255*931.5≈0.0954. So total ~3.726 +0.0954=3.8214. So 0.01 part is 9.315, 0.00410255 is ~3.8214. So 9.315 +3.8214=13.1364 MeV.

So 5589 +13.1364 = 5602.1364 MeV. So 5.6021364 GeV.

Wait, but using the sum of individual nucleons (without considering binding energy) gives me about 5.6335 GeV, which is higher than the actual rest mass. So which one should I use for the rest energy?

The problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6. Therefore, I should use the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is 5.6021 GeV.

Alternatively, sometimes in problems, the rest mass is approximated as the sum of individual nucleon masses, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute it that way. Hmm.

But the problem is about calculating the energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. So I'll proceed either way, but perhaps I should go with the actual rest mass.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I should just use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as m, and proceed from there.

But without exact data, perhaps I should proceed with the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute both approaches and see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the rest mass of Li-6 from standard tables. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u, so 6.0141 *931.5 = 5.602 GeV.

So, E_rest is 5.602 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, as computed earlier. So E_total is gamma * E_rest = 3.5714 *5.602 GeV.

Calculating that: 3 *5.602 is 16.806. 0.5714 *5.602 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.602=2.801, 0.0714 *5.602≈0.402. So total 2.801 +0.402=3.203. So sum is 16.806 +3.203=20.009 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20.009 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069. Hmm, but wait, I must have made a mistake because my calculation gives around 20 GeV, but let's see.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of gamma.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

E_rest is 5.602 GeV.

Gamma * E_rest is 3.5714 *5.602 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.602.

Break it down:

3 *5.602 = 16.806.

0.5714 *5.602: Let's compute 0.5 *5.602=2.801.

0.0714 *5.602: 0.07 *5.602=0.39214, 0.0014 *5.602=0.0078428. So total 0.39214+0.0078428=0.3999828.

So 2.801 + 0.3999828 ≈ 3.20098.

Total is 16.806 +3.20098=20.00698 GeV, approximately 20.007 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But wait, my approximation may have been rough. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which would give E_rest as 5.6335 GeV.

Calculating gamma*E_rest: 3.5714 *5.6335.

Let me compute this accurately.

3 *5.6335 = 16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6335: Let's compute 0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.0714 *5.6335: 0.07 *5.6335=0.394345; 0.0014 *5.6335=0.007887. So 0.394345 +0.007887=0.402232.

So 2.81675 +0.402232=3.218982.

Adding to 16.9005: 16.9005 + 3.218982 = 20.119482 GeV, which is approximately 20.119 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

E_rest using sum of nucleon masses:

3 protons (3 *938.272 MeV) = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons (3 *939.565 MeV) = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me write it as 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

Compute 0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857 ≈ let's compute 5.633511 * (1/700) ≈ approximately 0.00804787.

So 0.39434577 +0.00804787 ≈ 0.40239364.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.633511 is 2.8167555 +0.40239364 =3.21914914.

So total E_total is 16.900533 +3.21914914 = 20.119682 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than what I calculated. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used more precise neutron and proton masses.

Wait, perhaps the exact values for proton and neutron masses are needed. Let me check.

The proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So 3 protons are 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 * 5.633511 = ?

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511 = Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.03 =0.107142857.

3.57142857 *0.003511≈0.0125619.

So 0.107142857 +0.0125619≈0.119704757.

So total for 0.633511: 2.142857142 +0.119704757 ≈2.2625619.

Now, add to the 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.2625619=20.11970475 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So that's the correct answer perhaps.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is 5.602 GeV, not the sum of the nucleons. If I do that, then E_total would be 3.5714 *5.602.

3.5714 *5.602 =?

3 *5.602=16.806.

0.5714 *5.602: 0.5 *5.602=2.801; 0.0714*5.602≈0.402.

So 2.801+0.402=3.203.

Total E=16.806 +3.203=20.009 GeV, which is about 20.009 GeV. But this is about 0.12 GeV less than the option C value.

Hmm, but the options include option C as 20.132, which is close to 20.1197 when using the sum of nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of individual masses, so option C is the correct answer.

Wait, I should think again: the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the rest mass is the actual mass of Li-6, which is 6.0141 u. So I should use that.

So with E_rest=5.602 GeV, and gamma=3.5714, so E_total=3.5714*5.602.

Wait, let me do that calculation precisely.

3.5714 *5.602.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.602 = ?

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.002 *3.5714=0.0071428.

So sum is 2.14284 +0.0071428=2.15.

So 3.5714 *5.602 =17.857 +2.15=20.007 GeV.

So approximately 20.007 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, but that's 0.125 GeV higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the rest mass more accurately. Let me get the exact value of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01410255 u. So E_rest =6.01410255 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01410255 *931.5.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01410255 *931.5 =?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00410255 *931.5= let's compute 0.004 *931.5=3.726, 0.00010255 *931.5≈0.0954.

So sum 3.726 +0.0954=3.8214.

So 9.315 +3.8214=13.1364 MeV.

Total E_rest is 5589 +13.1364 =5602.1364 MeV =5.6021364 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total =3.57142857 *5.6021364.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.6021364.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6021364.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0021364 *3.57142857 ≈ let's approximate it as 0.0076333.

So 2.142857142 +0.0076333 ≈2.15049.

So total E_total is 17.85714285 +2.15049 ≈20.0076 GeV.

So about 20.0076 GeV, which rounds to 20.008 GeV. Looking at the options, the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, but that's much higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should be using the rest mass in terms of protons and neutrons, but I think I’ve tried that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. But the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" which is typically the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), but sometimes people refer to it as kinetic energy. Hmm, that could be a mistake.

Wait, the problem statement says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy here is the total energy, because the speed is determined by the total energy. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the charge particles, like using the mass of a single nucleon, but I don't think that applies here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857. Correct.

So E_total=gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps the error is that I used the molar mass as 6.0141 u for Li-6, but perhaps the actual value is slightly different. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that Li-6 has a binding energy of about 2.7 MeV (per nucleon?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to about 20.1197 GeV, which is option C: 20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using more precise masses would get closer.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of free nucleons, so the rest mass is indeed the sum, leading to 5.6335 GeV, and then E_total is 3.5714 *5.6335 = approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.12 GeV, but the option C is 20.132, which is very close.

So given that, the correct answer would be option C: 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was using a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

Gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Wait, but 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.571428571.

So E_rest = sum of the individual masses, 5.633511 GeV.

E_total=3.571428571 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511.

Break it down:

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.571428571.

Compute 5.633511 *0.5=2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.071428571.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07=0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.001428571≈0.00804787.

So 0.39434577 +0.00804787=0.40239364.

So 2.8167555 +0.40239364=3.21914914.

So E_total=16.900533 +3.21914914=20.11968214 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. But that's a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would lead to a little higher value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

Wait, the exact proton mass is 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is 939.5654 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.5654=2818.6962 MeV.

Total E_rest= (2814.816 +2818.6962) MeV =5633.5122 MeV =5.6335122 GeV.

Gamma =3.571428571.

So E_total=3.571428571 *5.6335122 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.571428571 *5.6335122.

5.6335122 *3 =16.9005366.

5.6335122 *0.571428571.

Compute 0.5 *5.6335122=2.8167561.

0.071428571 *5.6335122.

Compute 0.07 *5.6335122=0.394345854.

0.001428571 *5.6335122≈0.00804789.

So sum: 0.394345854 +0.00804789=0.40239374.

So total for 0.571428571 *5.6335122=2.8167561 +0.40239374=3.21914984.

Add to 16.9005366: 16.9005366 +3.21914984=20.11968644 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

So again, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but my precise calculation gives about 20.1197. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option C is 20.132 GeV. Let me see if there's any other factor I missed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Because sometimes, in such contexts, people refer to the kinetic energy as the 'energy' of the collider.

The kinetic energy K is E_total - E_rest.

So E_total=gamma*mc².

K = (gamma-1)*mc².

In that case, if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then K would be (3.5714 -1)*5.6335 GeV.

Which is 2.5714 *5.6335 ≈ ?

2 *5.6335 = 11.267.

0.5714 *5.6335≈3.218.

So total K ≈14.485 GeV. But that's not near any of the options except perhaps option A, which is about 18 GeV, but not matching. So I think the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that the nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons, and perhaps the charge affects the energy, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in using the sum of the nucleon masses. Let me compute the rest mass using exact values.

Wait, let me find the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01410255 u.

So E_rest =6.01410255 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.01410255 *931.5 = let me compute this precisely.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01410255 *931.5 =?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00410255 *931.5=0.004 *931.5=3.726; 0.00010255 *931.5=0.0954.

So 3.726 +0.0954=3.8214.

So 9.315 +3.8214=13.1364.

So E_rest =5589 +13.1364=5602.1364 MeV=5.6021364 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total=3.57142857 *5.6021364.

Let me compute this in more detail.

5.6021364 *3 =16.8064092.

5.6021364 *0.57142857.

Compute 0.5 *5.6021364=2.8010682.

0.07142857 *5.6021364.

Compute 0.07 *5.6021364=0.392149548.

0.00142857 *5.6021364≈0.00803879.

So sum: 0.392149548 +0.00803879=0.400188338.

So 2.8010682 +0.400188338=3.2012565.

So E_total=16.8064092 +3.2012565=20.0076657 GeV≈20.0077 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.008 GeV, which doesn't match any option exactly. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.12 GeV, but the option is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise terms.

Wait, perhaps 1/sqrt(0.0784) is not exactly 3.57142857. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Compute 0.28^2=0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So with E_rest=5.6021364 GeV:

E_total =3.57142857 *5.6021364=20.007666 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to E_rest=5.6335 GeV, and E_total=20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Given that, I think the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)), the total rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 3 \cdot 938.272 + 3 \cdot 939.565 = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \cdot E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \cdot 5.6335 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated total energy (\( \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.
