Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain time t, given a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup mentions vectors r, d, and v. Oh right, d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, the charge was at a different position at time tr, and now we're looking at the potentials at a later time t.

Wait, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V is associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. The potentials are usually solutions to certain equations, and for a moving charge, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and the retarded time.

Right, because the charge is moving, the fields aren't just static anymore. The scalar potential for a moving charge might not be as simple as the static case. Oh wait, in the static case, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, we have to consider the motion's effects.

I think the potentials for a moving charge are given using the concepts of retarded time. The idea is that the potential at a point r and time t depends on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the retarded time. The retarded time is when the influence of the charge would have left to reach the point r at time t.

So, the expressions involve the distance d, which is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. The distance d would then be related to the position vectors, like d = r - s(tr), I think.

Now, the scalar potential V. In the static case, it's q/(4πε₀ r), but when considering motion, we have to account for the fact that the charge's influence travels at the speed of light. So the denominator might not just be r anymore but something involving the distance and the velocity.

Wait, I remember the general form for the scalar potential includes a term like 1/(c²) involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe the denominator is adjusted by the component involving the velocity dot product with d. Let me think: The expression for the scalar potential when considering a moving charge is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [something involving (c² t' - v·r')], where t' is the retarded time and r' is the position at that time.

Wait, but in this problem, the options give expressions in terms of d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr). So the denominator in the potential expressions would involve terms like (d·v) perhaps.

Looking at the options, option C has V as qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and option D has (d c + d·v) in the denominator. Hmm. So the denominator is (dc - v·d) or (dc + v·d). Wait, which is correct?

I think when you have a moving charge, the denominator involves the term (c² t_r - v·r), where t_r is the retarded time. But in terms of vectors, maybe it's (c (t - t_r) ) - v·d. Wait, t and t_r are related because t > t_r. Let me think about how d is defined. d is r - s(tr), so the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, the denominator in the potential expressions would involve the term (c t_r - v · r) or something similar. Alternatively, in terms of d, perhaps it's (c t_r - v·d). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall the exact expressions.

In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the potentials for a moving charge are derived using retarded time. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c²)].

Wait, but I might have to think in terms of the denominator. Alternatively, the denominator is (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c). Or maybe it's (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c²). I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (r' · r̂ - (v·r̂)/c² ) ] or something like that, where r' is the position at time t_r.

Alternatively, the denominator would be c² (t - t_r) - v·d, because d is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point. So d = r - s(tr). So the denominator becomes c² (t - t_r) - (v · d).

Because the term c² (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the influence to reach r, but the charge's velocity affects this. So the denominator is c² (t - t_r) - (v · d). Hmm, but how is that represented in terms of d and c?

Wait, t - t_r is the time it takes for the signal to reach r from the charge's position at tr. So t - t_r = (|d|)/c, approximately. But that's only when the charge is not moving. When it's moving, the term gets modified by the velocity.

I think the denominator in the scalar potential ends up being (c (t - t_r) - (v · d)/c). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should think in terms of the expressions given in the options.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

So denominator is (d c - v·d) = c d - (v·d).

Wait, but what's the correct expression? Let me think about units. Scalar potential V should have units of volts, which is joules per coulomb, which is (kg·m²)/(s³·A·m). Electric potential is given by (q/(4πε₀ r)), so the denominator is distance. In option C, the denominator is (d c - v·d). The units of d are meters, c is m/s, so d c would be (m)(m/s) = m²/s. The dot product v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So the denominator has units of m²/s. So the units of V would be (C)/(4πε₀) * (s/m²) → (C·s)/(4πε₀ m²). But coulombs is A·s, so (A·s²)/(4πε₀ m²). The unit of ε₀ is F/m, which is (C²·s²)/(kg·m³), so putting it all together might not give the right units. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should have units of time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by certain integrals. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ δ(r - s(t')) ] / |r - s(t')| dt'. But when the charge is moving, the potential involves a term with the velocity.

Wait, more accurately, the scalar potential for a moving charge can be expressed as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |d| - (v·d̂)/c ) * (1/(c²)) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the denominator is ( |d| c - v·d ), divided by c^2.

Wait, I think I've seen the expression for V as (q/(4πε₀)) [1/( (d c - v·d)/c ) ].

So that would be (q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

Which matches option C's V expression.

Similarly, for the vector potential A, I remember that it's related to the current, which for a point charge is the charge times velocity. So A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some factor.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, but A is usually given by A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π) * something. But in the moving charge case, the denominator includes the same term as in V. So option C's expression for A would be (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ].

Wait, but the standard expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times 1/(c² (t - t_r) - v·d ), or something like that. So if V is (q c )/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d) ), then A would be (μ₀ q v )/(4π (d c - v·d) ), right? Because in the denominator, both potentials are using the same term.

Looking at option C: V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d )) and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d )).

Wait, but why is A multiplied by c? Because A has units of T·m² (tesla-meter squared?), alternatively, V·s/C. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are V = (q/(4π ε₀)) (1/( (d c - v·d)/c )) ), which would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d)), matching option C.

And for A, it's (μ₀ q v/(4π)) (1/( (d c - v·d)/c^2 )) ), so that's (μ₀ q v c^2 )/(4π (d c - v·d) ), but that doesn't match any options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by 1/(c² (t - t_r) - v·d ). But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are given by:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/( (r - (v t_r)/c ) ) ]

Wait, not exactly, because r is the observation point, and the charge is at s(tr) at time tr.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct option by considering the options.

Option B: V is (q/(4πε₀ r)), and A is (v/(c²)) V. That seems too simplistic because it's the static case, not considering the movement of the charge.

Option A: V is (q/(4πε₀ r)), A is (v²/c²) V. Also static, and A is proportional to v squared. That doesn't seem right.

Option C and D: Both involve expressions where the denominator is a function of d and v. So it's more likely to be either C or D.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Option D: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c + v·d)), A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + v·d)).

The difference between C and D is the sign in the denominator: minus or plus in (dc ± v·d).

Which one is correct? The denominator comes from the term (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c ). So in the denominator, it's (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c ), which is similar to ( (c² (t - t_r) - v·d ) ) / c. So the denominator would be (c² (t - t_r ) - v·d ), but (t - t_r) is approximately |d|/c, right? Because in the absence of motion, the time delay is |d|/c.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, the denominator becomes c² (t - t_r) - v·d. So if d is the vector from the charge to the observer, then v·d is the projection of the charge's velocity along the direction of d. So the denominator would be (c^2 (t - t_r) - (v · d)).

But let's think about this in terms of the expression in the options. So the denominator in the potentials is (d c - v·d) if we take c^2 (t - t_r) as d c (since d c would be c times the length of d, but that's not exactly accurate because d is a vector, so perhaps it's |d| c). Hmm, but in the denominator, it's (d c - v·d ), which is a scalar.

Wait, (d c) would be a vector, but option C has (d c - v·d) in the denominator, which is a scalar since it's a dot product. Oh wait, no, because d c would be a vector multiplied by a scalar c, and then subtracting v·d, which is a scalar. That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So I must be misunderstanding.

Wait no, probably the denominator is (c (t - t_r) - (v · (d̂)) ), but in terms of d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, maybe it's (d · v̂) which is v·d̂, where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. But in the options, it's written as (d c - v·d). Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally because d c is a vector times a scalar, resulting in a vector, but we have v·d, which is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is written as (c d - v·d), but that would be c times vector d, minus the scalar (v·d). That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps it's (c |d| - v·d), but that's not what the option says.

Hmm, maybe I should drop this approach. Let me think about the general expressions for potentials due to a moving charge.

The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) c - (v · (r - s(tr)) ) ) / c ]

Wait, that doesn't look right. Alternatively, another form is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( (r - s(tr)) c - (v (t - t_r)) ) ]

But (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the influence to reach r from s(tr), which is approximately |r - s(tr)| / c. So perhaps this term is (r - s(tr)) - v (t - t_r). But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential V can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( (r - (v t)) c - v t ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, I think the correct expression is that the scalar potential is:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v/c) cosθ )) ) ]

Where θ is the angle between v and d. So that would be (d · v̂ ) / |d|.

So the denominator becomes |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c )

Which can be rewritten as |d| c (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² )

Wait, so the denominator in terms of d is |d| c - (v · d). Because (v · d) is v |d| cosθ, which is the same as v |d| (v · d̂)/|d| = v·d.

Wait, so 1 - (v·d̂)/(c²) ) is the same as [ c² - (v·d̂) c ] / c². So perhaps the denominator in terms of d is |d| c - (v · d).

So the scalar potential becomes:

V = (q c)/(4πε₀ ( |d| c - (v·d) )).

Wait, but in the options, option C writes the denominator as (d c - v·d ). But d is a vector, so that would imply vector times c minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Because in the denominator, both terms should be in terms of meters. Because c is m/s, d is m. So d c is m*(m/s) = m²/s. Hmm, but we need meters in the denominator, not m²/s. So perhaps the correct denominator is |d| c - (v · d).

Wait, but |d| c would be (m)(m/s) = m²/s, and v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So the denominator would be in m²/s. Then the scalar potential would have units (C)/(4πε₀) * (s/m²), which is (C·s)/(4π ε₀ m²).

But C is A·s, so that's (A s²)/(4π ε₀ m²). The unit of V is volts, which is J/C = (kg m²/s³)/C. Let's compute the units for option C.

ε₀ has units F/m = C²/(N·m²) = C²/(kg m/s² * m²) ) = C²/(kg m³/s²) ). So 1/ε₀ has units kg m³/(C² s²).

So (1/(4π ε₀ )) has units kg m³/(4π C² s²).

Multiply by (q c)/(d c - v·d ). q is in Coulombs, c is m/s, denominator is (m²/s). So:

(q c ) → C * m/s.

Denominator: m²/s → so (q c )/(denominator) → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m).

Multiply by (1/(4π ε₀ )) → kg m³/(4π C² s²) * (C/m) → kg m²/(4π C s²).

But what's the unit of V? Volts are kg·m²/(s³·C). So this gives kg·m²/(s²·C) → which is (kg·m²)/(C·s²), but volts are kg·m²/(C·s³). So the units don't match. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption about the expression is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be (c |d| - v·d), which would be in meters. Because |d| is meters, c is m/s, so c |d| is (m/s)*m = m²/s. Wait, but that's not meters. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the denominator in the scalar potential expression is (c (t - t_r) - (v · (d)/c )) ), because d is r - s(tr), which is the vector from the charge's position to the observer. So (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the signal to reach the observer, which is approximately |d|/c. So,

denominator = c (t - t_r) - (v · d)/c.

But (t - t_r) is ≈ |d|/c, so c(t - t_r) ≈ |d|.

So denominator ≈ |d| - (v · d)/c.

But how does that look? It's |d| minus a term proportional to velocity.

Wait, but in terms of d, which is a vector, perhaps the denominator is |d| c - v·d.

Because |d| c is (m) * (m/s) = m²/s, v·d is (m/s) * m = m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s) - (m²/s) = m²/s.

So the scalar potential would then be:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [1/( (|d| c - v·d ) / c² ) ]

Because I think the denominator in the potential is (c (t - t_r) - (v · d)/c ), which when multiplied by c² gives (c² (t - t_r) - v·d ).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think about the expression again.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( (r - (v t)) · r̂ ) ] evaluated at the retarded time, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, from the Lienard's potentials, which are used for accelerated charges, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The potentials for a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/( |r - s(tr)| (1 - (v · r̂)/c ) ) ]

And the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v(t_r))/( (1 - (v · r̂)/c ) c² ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's right.

Alternatively, the scalar potential V can be written as:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) (1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/c² ) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following expressions:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) c - v (t - t_r) ) ]

Which would be a vector in the denominator, but that doesn't make sense because the denominator should be a scalar.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) · (r - s(tr)) )^{1/2} ( 1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/( c |r - s(tr)| ) ) ) ]

So the denominator is |d| ( 1 - (v · d̂ )/c )

Which can be rewritten as |d| ( (c² - v · d̂ c ) / c )

Wait, so denominator is (c |d| - (v · d )) / c.

So scalar potential is:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) [ c / (c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which gives V = (q c )/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d )).

But in the options, option C has the denominator as (d c - v·d ), which is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because d is a vector. Hmm, but in the expression above, the denominator is c |d| - v·d, which is a scalar because |d| is scalar and v·d is scalar.

So, the denominator is (c |d| - v·d ), which is scalar. So, V would be (q c )/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - v·d )).

Looking at the options, option C has (d c - v·d) in the denominator, but d is a vector. So that can't be correct. So perhaps the correct option is not among the choices, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the options have a typo, and it's |d| c - v·d. But in the given options, it's written as (d c - v·d ), which would be a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the options are using d as the magnitude of the vector d. Because in the options, it's written as 'd c', which would make d a scalar (magnitude of d) multiplied by c. So maybe the options treat d as |d|.

If that's the case, then the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d ), where d is |d|. So that makes sense because both terms are scalars. So then, the expression would be (q c )/(4π ε₀ ( |d| c - v·d )).

Which matches what I derived.

So V is as in option C, and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π ( |d| c - v·d )).

Looking at option C, A is written as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d )).

Assuming that d is the magnitude, then option C's A is correct.

So the correct option would be C.

The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \) at a later time \( t \), given the charge's trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The goal is to select the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a static charge, the scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r = |\vec{r}| \). However, for a moving charge, the motion introduces corrections due to the retarded time \( t_r \), which accounts for the finite speed of electromagnetic waves (\( c \)).
   - The denominator in the scalar potential involves the term \( c^2 (t - t_r) - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \), where \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. This term modifies the distance \( |\vec{d}| \) by accounting for the relativistic effects of motion.
   - Rewriting the denominator in terms of \( \vec{d} \), the scalar potential becomes:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}.
     \]
   - This matches the expression for \( V \) in **Option C**, assuming \( \vec{d} \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \) in the denominator.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is related to the motion of the charge and is proportional to its velocity \( \vec{v} \). For a moving charge, the vector potential is derived similarly to the scalar potential but involves the velocity of the charge.
   - The vector potential is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}.
     \]
   - This matches the expression for \( \vec{A} \) in **Option C**, again assuming \( \vec{d} \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \) in the denominator.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) do not account for the motion of the charge and are too simplistic, resembling the static case. This is incorrect.
   - **Option B:** Similar to Option A, the expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are static and do not include the corrections for the moving charge. This is also incorrect.
   - **Option C:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) correctly include the relativistic corrections involving \( \vec{d} \) and \( \vec{v} \), matching the derived forms above. This is correct.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a \( + \) sign instead of a \( - \), which is inconsistent with the relativistic corrections derived from the retarded time formalism. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, assuming \( \vec{d} \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \) in the denominator.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain time t, given a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup mentions vectors r, d, and v. Oh right, d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, the charge was at a different position at time tr, and now we're looking at the potentials at a later time t.

Wait, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V is associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. The potentials are usually solutions to certain equations, and for a moving charge, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and the retarded time.

Right, because the charge is moving, the fields aren't just static anymore. The scalar potential for a moving charge might not be as simple as the static case. Oh wait, in the static case, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, we have to consider the motion's effects.

I think the potentials for a moving charge are given using the concepts of retarded time. The idea is that the potential at a point r and time t depends on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the retarded time. The retarded time is when the influence of the charge would have left to reach the point r at time t.

So, the expressions involve the distance d, which is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. The distance d would then be related to the position vectors, like d = r - s(tr), I think.

Now, the scalar potential V. In the static case, it's q/(4πε₀ r), but when considering motion, we have to account for the fact that the charge's influence travels at the speed of light. So the denominator might not just be r anymore but something involving the distance and the velocity.

Wait, I remember the general form for the scalar potential includes a term like 1/(c²) involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe the denominator is adjusted by the component involving the velocity dot product with d. Let me think: The expression for the scalar potential when considering a moving charge is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [something involving (c² t' - v·r')], where t' is the retarded time and r' is the position at that time.

Wait, but in this problem, the options give expressions in terms of d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr). So the denominator in the potential expressions would involve terms like (d·v) perhaps.

Looking at the options, option C has V as qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and option D has (d c + d·v) in the denominator. Hmm. So the denominator is (dc - v·d) or (dc + v·d). Wait, which is correct?

I think when you have a moving charge, the denominator involves the term (c² t_r - v·r), where t_r is the retarded time. But in terms of vectors, maybe it's (c (t - t_r) ) - v·d. Wait, t and t_r are related because t > t_r. Let me think about how d is defined. d is r - s(tr), so the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, the denominator in the potential expressions would involve the term (c t_r - v · r) or something similar. Alternatively, in terms of d, perhaps it's (c t_r - v·d). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall the exact expressions.

In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the potentials for a moving charge are derived using retarded time. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c²)].

Wait, but I might have to think in terms of the denominator. Alternatively, the denominator is (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c). Or maybe it's (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c²). I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (r' · r̂ - (v·r̂)/c² ) ] or something like that, where r' is the position at time t_r.

Alternatively, the denominator would be c² (t - t_r) - v·d, because d is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point. So d = r - s(tr). So the denominator becomes c² (t - t_r) - (v · d).

Because the term c² (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the influence to reach r, but the charge's velocity affects this. So the denominator is c² (t - t_r) - (v · d). Hmm, but how is that represented in terms of d and c?

Wait, t - t_r is the time it takes for the signal to reach r from the charge's position at tr. So t - t_r = (|d|)/c, approximately. But that's only when the charge is not moving. When it's moving, the term gets modified by the velocity.

I think the denominator in the scalar potential ends up being (c (t - t_r) - (v · d)/c). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should think in terms of the expressions given in the options.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

So denominator is (d c - v·d) = c d - (v·d).

Wait, but what's the correct expression? Let me think about units. Scalar potential V should have units of volts, which is joules per coulomb, which is (kg·m²)/(s³·A·m). Electric potential is given by (q/(4πε₀ r)), so the denominator is distance. In option C, the denominator is (d c - v·d). The units of d are meters, c is m/s, so d c would be (m)(m/s) = m²/s. The dot product v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So the denominator has units of m²/s. So the units of V would be (C)/(4πε₀) * (s/m²) → (C·s)/(4πε₀ m²). But coulombs is A·s, so (A·s²)/(4πε₀ m²). The unit of ε₀ is F/m, which is (C²·s²)/(kg·m³), so putting it all together might not give the right units. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should have units of time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by certain integrals. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ δ(r - s(t')) ] / |r - s(t')| dt'. But when the charge is moving, the potential involves a term with the velocity.

Wait, more accurately, the scalar potential for a moving charge can be expressed as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |d| - (v·d̂)/c ) * (1/(c²)) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the denominator is ( |d| c - v·d ), divided by c^2.

Wait, I think I've seen the expression for V as (q/(4πε₀)) [1/( (d c - v·d)/c ) ].

So that would be (q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

Which matches option C's V expression.

Similarly, for the vector potential A, I remember that it's related to the current, which for a point charge is the charge times velocity. So A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some factor.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, but A is usually given by A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π) * something. But in the moving charge case, the denominator includes the same term as in V. So option C's expression for A would be (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ].

Wait, but the standard expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times 1/(c² (t - t_r) - v·d ), or something like that. So if V is (q c )/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d) ), then A would be (μ₀ q v )/(4π (d c - v·d) ), right? Because in the denominator, both potentials are using the same term.

Looking at option C: V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d )) and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d )).

Wait, but why is A multiplied by c? Because A has units of T·m² (tesla-meter squared?), alternatively, V·s/C. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are V = (q/(4π ε₀)) (1/( (d c - v·d)/c )) ), which would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d)), matching option C.

And for A, it's (μ₀ q v/(4π)) (1/( (d c - v·d)/c^2 )) ), so that's (μ₀ q v c^2 )/(4π (d c - v·d) ), but that doesn't match any options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by 1/(c² (t - t_r) - v·d ). But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are given by:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/( (r - (v t_r)/c ) ) ]

Wait, not exactly, because r is the observation point, and the charge is at s(tr) at time tr.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct option by considering the options.

Option B: V is (q/(4πε₀ r)), and A is (v/(c²)) V. That seems too simplistic because it's the static case, not considering the movement of the charge.

Option A: V is (q/(4πε₀ r)), A is (v²/c²) V. Also static, and A is proportional to v squared. That doesn't seem right.

Option C and D: Both involve expressions where the denominator is a function of d and v. So it's more likely to be either C or D.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Option D: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c + v·d)), A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + v·d)).

The difference between C and D is the sign in the denominator: minus or plus in (dc ± v·d).

Which one is correct? The denominator comes from the term (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c ). So in the denominator, it's (c (t - t_r) - (v·d)/c ), which is similar to ( (c² (t - t_r) - v·d ) ) / c. So the denominator would be (c² (t - t_r ) - v·d ), but (t - t_r) is approximately |d|/c, right? Because in the absence of motion, the time delay is |d|/c.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, the denominator becomes c² (t - t_r) - v·d. So if d is the vector from the charge to the observer, then v·d is the projection of the charge's velocity along the direction of d. So the denominator would be (c^2 (t - t_r) - (v · d)).

But let's think about this in terms of the expression in the options. So the denominator in the potentials is (d c - v·d) if we take c^2 (t - t_r) as d c (since d c would be c times the length of d, but that's not exactly accurate because d is a vector, so perhaps it's |d| c). Hmm, but in the denominator, it's (d c - v·d ), which is a scalar.

Wait, (d c) would be a vector, but option C has (d c - v·d) in the denominator, which is a scalar since it's a dot product. Oh wait, no, because d c would be a vector multiplied by a scalar c, and then subtracting v·d, which is a scalar. That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So I must be misunderstanding.

Wait no, probably the denominator is (c (t - t_r) - (v · (d̂)) ), but in terms of d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, maybe it's (d · v̂) which is v·d̂, where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. But in the options, it's written as (d c - v·d). Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally because d c is a vector times a scalar, resulting in a vector, but we have v·d, which is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is written as (c d - v·d), but that would be c times vector d, minus the scalar (v·d). That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps it's (c |d| - v·d), but that's not what the option says.

Hmm, maybe I should drop this approach. Let me think about the general expressions for potentials due to a moving charge.

The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) c - (v · (r - s(tr)) ) ) / c ]

Wait, that doesn't look right. Alternatively, another form is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( (r - s(tr)) c - (v (t - t_r)) ) ]

But (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the influence to reach r from s(tr), which is approximately |r - s(tr)| / c. So perhaps this term is (r - s(tr)) - v (t - t_r). But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential V can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( (r - (v t)) c - v t ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, I think the correct expression is that the scalar potential is:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v/c) cosθ )) ) ]

Where θ is the angle between v and d. So that would be (d · v̂ ) / |d|.

So the denominator becomes |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c )

Which can be rewritten as |d| c (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² )

Wait, so the denominator in terms of d is |d| c - (v · d). Because (v · d) is v |d| cosθ, which is the same as v |d| (v · d̂)/|d| = v·d.

Wait, so 1 - (v·d̂)/(c²) ) is the same as [ c² - (v·d̂) c ] / c². So perhaps the denominator in terms of d is |d| c - (v · d).

So the scalar potential becomes:

V = (q c)/(4πε₀ ( |d| c - (v·d) )).

Wait, but in the options, option C writes the denominator as (d c - v·d ). But d is a vector, so that would imply vector times c minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Because in the denominator, both terms should be in terms of meters. Because c is m/s, d is m. So d c is m*(m/s) = m²/s. Hmm, but we need meters in the denominator, not m²/s. So perhaps the correct denominator is |d| c - (v · d).

Wait, but |d| c would be (m)(m/s) = m²/s, and v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So the denominator would be in m²/s. Then the scalar potential would have units (C)/(4πε₀) * (s/m²), which is (C·s)/(4π ε₀ m²).

But C is A·s, so that's (A s²)/(4π ε₀ m²). The unit of V is volts, which is J/C = (kg m²/s³)/C. Let's compute the units for option C.

ε₀ has units F/m = C²/(N·m²) = C²/(kg m/s² * m²) ) = C²/(kg m³/s²) ). So 1/ε₀ has units kg m³/(C² s²).

So (1/(4π ε₀ )) has units kg m³/(4π C² s²).

Multiply by (q c)/(d c - v·d ). q is in Coulombs, c is m/s, denominator is (m²/s). So:

(q c ) → C * m/s.

Denominator: m²/s → so (q c )/(denominator) → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m).

Multiply by (1/(4π ε₀ )) → kg m³/(4π C² s²) * (C/m) → kg m²/(4π C s²).

But what's the unit of V? Volts are kg·m²/(s³·C). So this gives kg·m²/(s²·C) → which is (kg·m²)/(C·s²), but volts are kg·m²/(C·s³). So the units don't match. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption about the expression is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be (c |d| - v·d), which would be in meters. Because |d| is meters, c is m/s, so c |d| is (m/s)*m = m²/s. Wait, but that's not meters. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the denominator in the scalar potential expression is (c (t - t_r) - (v · (d)/c )) ), because d is r - s(tr), which is the vector from the charge's position to the observer. So (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the signal to reach the observer, which is approximately |d|/c. So,

denominator = c (t - t_r) - (v · d)/c.

But (t - t_r) is ≈ |d|/c, so c(t - t_r) ≈ |d|.

So denominator ≈ |d| - (v · d)/c.

But how does that look? It's |d| minus a term proportional to velocity.

Wait, but in terms of d, which is a vector, perhaps the denominator is |d| c - v·d.

Because |d| c is (m) * (m/s) = m²/s, v·d is (m/s) * m = m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s) - (m²/s) = m²/s.

So the scalar potential would then be:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [1/( (|d| c - v·d ) / c² ) ]

Because I think the denominator in the potential is (c (t - t_r) - (v · d)/c ), which when multiplied by c² gives (c² (t - t_r) - v·d ).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think about the expression again.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( (r - (v t)) · r̂ ) ] evaluated at the retarded time, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, from the Lienard's potentials, which are used for accelerated charges, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The potentials for a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/( |r - s(tr)| (1 - (v · r̂)/c ) ) ]

And the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v(t_r))/( (1 - (v · r̂)/c ) c² ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's right.

Alternatively, the scalar potential V can be written as:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) (1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/c² ) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following expressions:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) c - v (t - t_r) ) ]

Which would be a vector in the denominator, but that doesn't make sense because the denominator should be a scalar.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) · (r - s(tr)) )^{1/2} ( 1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/( c |r - s(tr)| ) ) ) ]

So the denominator is |d| ( 1 - (v · d̂ )/c )

Which can be rewritten as |d| ( (c² - v · d̂ c ) / c )

Wait, so denominator is (c |d| - (v · d )) / c.

So scalar potential is:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) [ c / (c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which gives V = (q c )/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d )).

But in the options, option C has the denominator as (d c - v·d ), which is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because d is a vector. Hmm, but in the expression above, the denominator is c |d| - v·d, which is a scalar because |d| is scalar and v·d is scalar.

So, the denominator is (c |d| - v·d ), which is scalar. So, V would be (q c )/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - v·d )).

Looking at the options, option C has (d c - v·d) in the denominator, but d is a vector. So that can't be correct. So perhaps the correct option is not among the choices, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the options have a typo, and it's |d| c - v·d. But in the given options, it's written as (d c - v·d ), which would be a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the options are using d as the magnitude of the vector d. Because in the options, it's written as 'd c', which would make d a scalar (magnitude of d) multiplied by c. So maybe the options treat d as |d|.

If that's the case, then the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d ), where d is |d|. So that makes sense because both terms are scalars. So then, the expression would be (q c )/(4π ε₀ ( |d| c - v·d )).

Which matches what I derived.

So V is as in option C, and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π ( |d| c - v·d )).

Looking at option C, A is written as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d )).

Assuming that d is the magnitude, then option C's A is correct.

So the correct option would be C.


The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \) at a later time \( t \), given the charge's trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The goal is to select the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a static charge, the scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r = |\vec{r}| \). However, for a moving charge, the motion introduces corrections due to the retarded time \( t_r \), which accounts for the finite speed of electromagnetic waves (\( c \)).
   - The denominator in the scalar potential involves the term \( c^2 (t - t_r) - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \), where \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. This term modifies the distance \( |\vec{d}| \) by accounting for the relativistic effects of motion.
   - Rewriting the denominator in terms of \( \vec{d} \), the scalar potential becomes:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}.
     \]
   - This matches the expression for \( V \) in **Option C**, assuming \( \vec{d} \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \) in the denominator.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is related to the motion of the charge and is proportional to its velocity \( \vec{v} \). For a moving charge, the vector potential is derived similarly to the scalar potential but involves the velocity of the charge.
   - The vector potential is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}.
     \]
   - This matches the expression for \( \vec{A} \) in **Option C**, again assuming \( \vec{d} \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \) in the denominator.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) do not account for the motion of the charge and are too simplistic, resembling the static case. This is incorrect.
   - **Option B:** Similar to Option A, the expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are static and do not include the corrections for the moving charge. This is also incorrect.
   - **Option C:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) correctly include the relativistic corrections involving \( \vec{d} \) and \( \vec{v} \), matching the derived forms above. This is correct.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a \( + \) sign instead of a \( - \), which is inconsistent with the relativistic corrections derived from the retarded time formalism. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, assuming \( \vec{d} \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \) in the denominator.

**Answer: C**
