Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method was used, and the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's motion towards and away from us. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right?

So planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question says that the shift in planet #2's host was 7 milliangstrom. So, planet #2's star has a 7 mA shift. So, wait, lower shift? Because higher shifts might mean more velocity.

Wait, wait. The RV method measures the velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. The formula I remember is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some formula. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * ( (1) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) ... Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula for K.

Wait, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's better to approach it from Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the masses involved. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+M')) a³, where M is the mass of the star and M' is the planet's mass. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M+M' ≈ M. So, P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³.

But wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The velocity of the star in its orbit is related to the planet's velocity. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. So, the star's velocity is v = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * v_p, where v_p is the planet's orbital speed. Since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to v ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p.

But v_p is the planet's orbital speed, which from Keplerian mechanics is sqrt(G M_star / a). So, v = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star /a ) = M_p / sqrt( M_star a ) * sqrt( G ) 

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K (the star's velocity) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, another formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe a better approach is to relate K (the velocity semi-amplitude) to the orbital period and the mass.

Wait, alternatively, since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun) and the planets have similar mass (Neptune-like), perhaps the ratio of their velocities can be used to find the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. So, K is proportional to the planet's mass, the sine of the inclination (assumed edge-on, so sin i = 1), and inversely proportional to (star's mass)^(1/3) times (1 + planet/star mass)^(1/3), but since planet is much less massive, this term is ~1.

Wait, the formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps the exact formula is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ≈ 1. So:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I can write K as proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, given that M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, since both stars have same mass as Sun and planets are similar to Neptune, so M_p is same for both, M_star same for both.

So, K is proportional to 1 / sqrt(P). Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. Let me take the formula:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

Which means P ∝ (1/K)^(3)

So, if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2, then P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3

Wait, because P is inversely proportional to K^(3). So:

P = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1/(K)) )^3 )

So, for two planets, P2/P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3

Because P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me say that K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 / K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, that's if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = C * 1/(P1^(1/3)), and K2 = C * 1/(P2^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, but in the problem, the RV shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So, planet #1 has K1 =5 mA, planet #2 has K2=7 mA.

Wait, no, wait. The RV method's semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. So, a larger K would mean a higher velocity, which could imply a more massive planet or a closer orbit, which would lead to a shorter orbital period.

So, the problem says:

Planet #1's spectral line shifts by 5 mA. Planet #2's star shifts by 7 mA. So, K1 =5 mA, K2=7 mA? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question says: the shift of the spectral line for planet #1 is up to 5 mA, and for planet #2, it's 7 mA.

Wait, but the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So, K is proportional to the velocity.

So, K for planet #1 is 5 mA, for planet #2 is 7 mA.

Wait, but in terms of velocity, 1 mA is 1e-3 Angstroms. But the actual velocity depends on the wavelength, because the Doppler shift formula is (Δλ/λ) = v/(c), so v = c * (Δλ/λ )

But in this problem, both measurements are at the same wavelength, so the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to Δλ.

So, K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2=5/7.

Now, from earlier, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, earlier I thought P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me recap:

Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K^(3)

So, P2 = (1/K2^3) * C, P1 = (1/K1^3) * C

So, P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3

So, yes, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, no, wait: If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = [C / P1^(1/3)] / [C / P2^(1/3)] ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, so the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

But let me plug in the numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

Wait, that would mean that if planet #1 has a period P1, planet #2's period is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is longer by a factor of approximately 0.364.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no: if P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1, then if K1 is smaller than K2, (K1/K2) is less than 1. So P2 is less than P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

So, if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.364 times as long as planet #1's. So, it's shorter, not longer.

But the options are about how many times longer. So, perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, maybe I mixed up K1 and K2. Let me double-check.

The question says that Planet #1's shift is 5 mA, and Planet #2's is 7 mA. So, K1=5, K2=7.

So, (K1/K2) =5/7 ≈0.714.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, (K1/K2)^3 ≈0.364 → P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is shorter than P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is about 0.364 times the length of planet #1's. So, it's not longer. So the question must be about the longer period.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

If K is the velocity semi-amplitude and is larger when the planet is more massive or closer to the star (shorter orbital period), then a larger K implies a shorter period.

In this case, planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5 mA), so its period should be shorter than planet #1's.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1's. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? Well, since it's shorter, the factor would be less than 1. So the options are looking for a number less than 1.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, 0.36 is option A. So, if P2 = 0.36 * P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's about 0.36 times longer. Wait, that's not correct wording. If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's, meaning it's shorter by a factor of 2.777 (1/0.36 ≈2.777). So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter, not longer.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula.

Another approach: from Kepler's third law, P² is proportional to a³/(M). Since M is same for both, P² ∝ a³.

But the RV method gives us the velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. The star's velocity is K, the planet's speed is higher.

Wait, the planet's orbital speed v_p is related to the star's speed v_s by the mass ratio. Since M_star >> M_planet, v_p ≈ (M_star / M_planet) * v_s. Or perhaps M_planet * v_p = M_star * v_s.

Yes, because the center of mass is stationary, so M_p * a_p = M_s * a_s. And since a_p = (a_s * (M_s)/(M_p)) ). Alternatively, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

So, v_p = (M_s / M_p) * v_s

But v_p is also given by sqrt( G M_s / a ), from circular orbit.

So, v_s = (M_p / M_s) * v_p = (M_p / M_s) * sqrt( G M_s / a )

= sqrt( G M_s ) * M_p / ( M_s sqrt(a) )

= sqrt( G ) * M_p / ( M_s^(1/2) sqrt(a) )

But from Kepler's third law, a³ = G M_s P² / (4 π² )

So, a = [ G M_s (P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Substituting into the expression for v_s:

v_s = sqrt(G) * M_p / ( M_s^(1/2) * [ (G M_s P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/6) )

Simplify denominator:

M_s^(1/2) * [ (G M_s P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/6) = M_s^{ 1/2 + (1/6)(1) } * G^{1/6} P^{1/3} (4 π²)^{-1/6}

So, 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3.

So denominator becomes M_s^{2/3} * G^{1/6} P^{1/3} (4 π²)^{-1/6}

Thus, v_s = [ sqrt(G) * M_p ] / [ M_s^{2/3} * G^{1/6} P^{1/3} (4 π²)^{-1/6} ) ]

Break it down:

sqrt(G) is G^(1/2) = G^(3/6)

Denominator's G term is G^(1/6).

So, G^(3/6) / G^(1/6) = G^(2/6) = G^(1/3)

Similarly, the denominator also has (4 π²)^{-1/6} → which is same as (4 π²)^{1/6} in numerator.

Putting it together:

v_s = M_p * G^{1/3} * (4 π²)^{1/6} / ( M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

But considering the constants: 4 π² is a constant, so (4 π²)^{1/6} is just another constant factor, which I'll call C.

So, v_s = ( M_p * C ) / ( M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

Which means v_s is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, so P is proportional to (v_s)^{-3}.

So, P ∝ (v_s)^{-3}

So, P ∝ (K)^{-3}, since K is the velocity semi-amplitude.

Thus, the ratio of periods P2/P1 is equal to ( K1 / K2 )^3

Because P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then:

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So, it's shorter.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, if planet #2's period is shorter, the factor is less than 1. So, the factor is about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So, that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, \( K \), is proportional to the star's velocity caused by the planet's gravitational pull. For circular orbits, \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)).
- Planet #2 causes a spectral line shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)).

The ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. The question asks how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1, so the factor is less than 1. The closest option is **0.36**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method was used, and the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's motion towards and away from us. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right?

So planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question says that the shift in planet #2's host was 7 milliangstrom. So, planet #2's star has a 7 mA shift. So, wait, lower shift? Because higher shifts might mean more velocity.

Wait, wait. The RV method measures the velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. The formula I remember is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some formula. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * ( (1) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) ... Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula for K.

Wait, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's better to approach it from Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the masses involved. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+M')) a³, where M is the mass of the star and M' is the planet's mass. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M+M' ≈ M. So, P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³.

But wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The velocity of the star in its orbit is related to the planet's velocity. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. So, the star's velocity is v = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * v_p, where v_p is the planet's orbital speed. Since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to v ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p.

But v_p is the planet's orbital speed, which from Keplerian mechanics is sqrt(G M_star / a). So, v = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star /a ) = M_p / sqrt( M_star a ) * sqrt( G ) 

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K (the star's velocity) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, another formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe a better approach is to relate K (the velocity semi-amplitude) to the orbital period and the mass.

Wait, alternatively, since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun) and the planets have similar mass (Neptune-like), perhaps the ratio of their velocities can be used to find the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. So, K is proportional to the planet's mass, the sine of the inclination (assumed edge-on, so sin i = 1), and inversely proportional to (star's mass)^(1/3) times (1 + planet/star mass)^(1/3), but since planet is much less massive, this term is ~1.

Wait, the formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps the exact formula is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ≈ 1. So:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I can write K as proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, given that M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, since both stars have same mass as Sun and planets are similar to Neptune, so M_p is same for both, M_star same for both.

So, K is proportional to 1 / sqrt(P). Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. Let me take the formula:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

Which means P ∝ (1/K)^(3)

So, if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2, then P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3

Wait, because P is inversely proportional to K^(3). So:

P = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1/(K)) )^3 )

So, for two planets, P2/P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3

Because P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me say that K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 / K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, that's if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = C * 1/(P1^(1/3)), and K2 = C * 1/(P2^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, but in the problem, the RV shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So, planet #1 has K1 =5 mA, planet #2 has K2=7 mA.

Wait, no, wait. The RV method's semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. So, a larger K would mean a higher velocity, which could imply a more massive planet or a closer orbit, which would lead to a shorter orbital period.

So, the problem says:

Planet #1's spectral line shifts by 5 mA. Planet #2's star shifts by 7 mA. So, K1 =5 mA, K2=7 mA? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question says: the shift of the spectral line for planet #1 is up to 5 mA, and for planet #2, it's 7 mA.

Wait, but the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So, K is proportional to the velocity.

So, K for planet #1 is 5 mA, for planet #2 is 7 mA.

Wait, but in terms of velocity, 1 mA is 1e-3 Angstroms. But the actual velocity depends on the wavelength, because the Doppler shift formula is (Δλ/λ) = v/(c), so v = c * (Δλ/λ )

But in this problem, both measurements are at the same wavelength, so the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to Δλ.

So, K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2=5/7.

Now, from earlier, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, earlier I thought P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me recap:

Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K^(3)

So, P2 = (1/K2^3) * C, P1 = (1/K1^3) * C

So, P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3

So, yes, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, no, wait: If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = [C / P1^(1/3)] / [C / P2^(1/3)] ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, so the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

But let me plug in the numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

Wait, that would mean that if planet #1 has a period P1, planet #2's period is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is longer by a factor of approximately 0.364.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no: if P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1, then if K1 is smaller than K2, (K1/K2) is less than 1. So P2 is less than P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

So, if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.364 times as long as planet #1's. So, it's shorter, not longer.

But the options are about how many times longer. So, perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, maybe I mixed up K1 and K2. Let me double-check.

The question says that Planet #1's shift is 5 mA, and Planet #2's is 7 mA. So, K1=5, K2=7.

So, (K1/K2) =5/7 ≈0.714.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, (K1/K2)^3 ≈0.364 → P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is shorter than P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is about 0.364 times the length of planet #1's. So, it's not longer. So the question must be about the longer period.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

If K is the velocity semi-amplitude and is larger when the planet is more massive or closer to the star (shorter orbital period), then a larger K implies a shorter period.

In this case, planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5 mA), so its period should be shorter than planet #1's.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1's. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? Well, since it's shorter, the factor would be less than 1. So the options are looking for a number less than 1.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, 0.36 is option A. So, if P2 = 0.36 * P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's about 0.36 times longer. Wait, that's not correct wording. If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's, meaning it's shorter by a factor of 2.777 (1/0.36 ≈2.777). So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter, not longer.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula.

Another approach: from Kepler's third law, P² is proportional to a³/(M). Since M is same for both, P² ∝ a³.

But the RV method gives us the velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. The star's velocity is K, the planet's speed is higher.

Wait, the planet's orbital speed v_p is related to the star's speed v_s by the mass ratio. Since M_star >> M_planet, v_p ≈ (M_star / M_planet) * v_s. Or perhaps M_planet * v_p = M_star * v_s.

Yes, because the center of mass is stationary, so M_p * a_p = M_s * a_s. And since a_p = (a_s * (M_s)/(M_p)) ). Alternatively, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

So, v_p = (M_s / M_p) * v_s

But v_p is also given by sqrt( G M_s / a ), from circular orbit.

So, v_s = (M_p / M_s) * v_p = (M_p / M_s) * sqrt( G M_s / a )

= sqrt( G M_s ) * M_p / ( M_s sqrt(a) )

= sqrt( G ) * M_p / ( M_s^(1/2) sqrt(a) )

But from Kepler's third law, a³ = G M_s P² / (4 π² )

So, a = [ G M_s (P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Substituting into the expression for v_s:

v_s = sqrt(G) * M_p / ( M_s^(1/2) * [ (G M_s P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/6) )

Simplify denominator:

M_s^(1/2) * [ (G M_s P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/6) = M_s^{ 1/2 + (1/6)(1) } * G^{1/6} P^{1/3} (4 π²)^{-1/6}

So, 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3.

So denominator becomes M_s^{2/3} * G^{1/6} P^{1/3} (4 π²)^{-1/6}

Thus, v_s = [ sqrt(G) * M_p ] / [ M_s^{2/3} * G^{1/6} P^{1/3} (4 π²)^{-1/6} ) ]

Break it down:

sqrt(G) is G^(1/2) = G^(3/6)

Denominator's G term is G^(1/6).

So, G^(3/6) / G^(1/6) = G^(2/6) = G^(1/3)

Similarly, the denominator also has (4 π²)^{-1/6} → which is same as (4 π²)^{1/6} in numerator.

Putting it together:

v_s = M_p * G^{1/3} * (4 π²)^{1/6} / ( M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

But considering the constants: 4 π² is a constant, so (4 π²)^{1/6} is just another constant factor, which I'll call C.

So, v_s = ( M_p * C ) / ( M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

Which means v_s is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, so P is proportional to (v_s)^{-3}.

So, P ∝ (v_s)^{-3}

So, P ∝ (K)^{-3}, since K is the velocity semi-amplitude.

Thus, the ratio of periods P2/P1 is equal to ( K1 / K2 )^3

Because P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then:

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So, it's shorter.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, if planet #2's period is shorter, the factor is less than 1. So, the factor is about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So, that's the answer.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, \( K \), is proportional to the star's velocity caused by the planet's gravitational pull. For circular orbits, \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)).
- Planet #2 causes a spectral line shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)).

The ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. The question asks how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1, so the factor is less than 1. The closest option is **0.36**.
