Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Ring-closing metathesis is when two alkenes in the same molecule react to form a ring, right? So the idea is that the catalyst (like Grubbs catalyst) facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds to create a cyclic structure.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me visualize that structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are: at position 3, a methyl group; at position 4, another methyl; and at position 5, an isopropyl group. Oh wait, and the double bond is at position 1-2, since it's cyclohex-1-ene.

So the ring is six-membered. Now, the starting material would be a diene that, when undergoing metathesis, forms this cyclohexene. Ring-closing metathesis usually requires two double bonds in the molecule, which then rearrange to form a ring and create a new double bond.

Wait, no, actually, isn't it that ring-closing metathesis typically starts with a diene and a dienophile, or perhaps two alkenes that can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. No, metathesis is more about breaking and recombining the double bonds.

Wait, in ring-closing metathesis, you have two alkenes in the same molecule. The catalyst breaks each alkene and then reconnects them in a way that forms a ring. So for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes are probably separated by a certain number of carbons.

So the starting material would be a diene where when the metathesis occurs, the two ends form a ring. Let me think: the target molecule has substituents at positions 3,4,5. So if the ring is formed by connecting, say, the ends of a chain, the substituents should be positioned in a way that allows the ring to form with those substituents.

Looking at the options, they're all octadienes. So the starting material is an octadiene that will form the cyclohexene when the two double bonds undergo metathesis.

Let me try to model this. The target molecule is cyclohexene, so the starting material's diene must be part of a chain that can cyclize into a six-membered ring. So the starting material has a chain of eight carbons because it's octa... Wait, octa has eight carbons, but the ring is six. So, the two double bonds in the starting material would be spaced in such a way that when they undergo metathesis, the ends come together to form a six-membered ring.

So, the starting material would have two double bonds, say, at positions 1 and 7 (octa-1,7-diene), but that seems a bit far apart. Alternatively, maybe the positions are closer.

Wait, maybe it's positions 2 and 6. Let me think: If the starting material is octa-2,6-diene, then each double bond is at positions 2 and 6. The chain has eight carbons in total. So, positions 1 to 8.

When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break both double bonds and re-form the double bond in a way that the ends connect to form the ring. So, the ring would be formed by connecting the ends of the diene.

Wait, but what's the structure of the target? So, the target is a cyclohexene. The substituents are at carbons 3,4,5. So when the ring is formed, those substituents come into position.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are positioned such that, upon ring formation, they end up at the correct positions.

Let me take each option and see.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait, octa-1,7-diene means double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. Let's see: positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has isopropyl.

If the molecule is octa-1,7-diene, then the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

At position 3: CH(CH3)

Position 4: CH(CH3)

Position 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)

Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about how the ring forms. When you have a diene like 1,7-octadiene, the ends (1 and 7) are the ends of the chain. When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break each double bond, and the ends would connect. So, the distance between the two ends should be such that when they form a ring, it's a six-membered ring.

Wait, but the chain is eight carbons. So, if you have a diene at positions 1 and 7, the chain between the ends is 8 carbons. Wait, the positions are 1 and 7, so between the two double bonds, there are 5 carbons (positions 3,4,5,6,7). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the length of the chain that forms the ring. Let me think about the ring-closing metathesis process. The process brings together two carbons that were previously part of different alkenes. So, the two alkenes are separated by a certain number of carbons, and when they undergo metathesis, the chain forms a ring.

In the case of a six-membered ring, the two alkenes are probably separated by four carbons. Because, when the two ends (each from an alkene) are connected, the total number of carbons in the ring would be the number of carbons between the two alkenes plus two (the two alkenes' carbons). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If the starting material is an eight-carbon diene, and after ring formation, it becomes a six-membered ring (so six carbons), that suggests that two alkenes are in the same molecule, and the ring forms by connecting the ends, thereby losing two carbons (but I'm not sure... no, wait, metathesis doesn't lose atoms, it just rearranges them. So the total number of carbons should remain the same.)

Wait, the target is cyclohexene, which is six carbons. The starting material is an octadiene, which is eight carbons. So how does that work? Oh, because in the metathesis process, two alkenes are in the same molecule, and when the ring forms, the two alkenes are repositioned. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene that, when the metathesis occurs, forms the cyclohexene plus two ethylene molecules? No, I don't think so. Because Grubbs catalyst is for olefin metathesis, which exchanges the ends of alkenes. So, in ring-closing, two alkenes in the same molecule undergo metathesis to form a ring, and any substituents stay on the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with eight carbons, and the ring is six carbons, so the two alkenes are in positions that, when connected, form the six-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material is octadiene, which has eight carbons. So, if it's a diene, two of those are double bonds. So, the chain is longer than the ring. When you form a ring, the substituents from the ends of the chain become substituents on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are positioned such that when the ring is formed, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to model the correct option.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So, substituents at positions 3,4,5.

So, in the starting material (which is an octadiene), these substituents should be in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has the substituents in positions that, when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms between the two ends, bringing the substituents to their positions.

So, for example, in the starting material, the substituents (methyl and isopropyl) are on carbons that will end up in positions 3,4,5 when the ring forms.

So, imagine the starting material is a linear molecule with double bonds at certain positions, with substituents placed in such a way that after ring formation, they are correctly placed.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the substituents are at positions 3 (CH3), 4 (CH3), 5 (CH(CH2CH3)2). The double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8.

If this undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 7) would form the ring. So, the ring would have six members: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 (since 1 connects to 7, which is now position 6 in the ring? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to think about this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, maybe I should write it as:

The molecule is 5-isopropyl etc. So, substituents at 3,4,5.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2

Wait, but I might be getting the substituents misplaced. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Positions 1,2: CH2=CH-

Position 3: CH2- with a methyl group (3- CH(CH3))

Position 4: CH(CH3)

Position 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, so the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

But then, the double bonds are at 1 and 7. So positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst will facilitate the exchange of the ends. The 1,2 double bond and the 7,8 double bond would break, and the ends would connect. So, the 1 (CH2=CH-) would connect to the 8 (CH2), and the 2 would connect to the 7.

Wait, but how does that form a ring? Let me think. When the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the four carbons (positions 1,2 and 7,8) would form a new double bond. So, in this case, the ring would be formed by connecting the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) to the 7th carbon (from the second double bond). Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis forms a new double bond between the ends of the diene. So, the starting material is 1,7-diene. So, the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The ring would form by connecting the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) to the 7th carbon (from the second double bond), and the 1st carbon would connect to the 8th, but that seems a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the ring is formed by taking the two ends of the diene and connecting them. So, the 1st and 7th positions would form the ring. But that would require that the distance between them is such that the ring is six-membered.

Wait, the chain is eight carbons. So, if I connect the 1st and 7th, that's a five-carbon bridge, but that would form a five-membered ring, not six. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting material as having the two double bonds in positions that are four carbons apart. So, for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes are separated by four carbons. Because when you form the ring, each end of the alkenes becomes adjacent in the ring.

So, for example, in the starting material, the first double bond is at position 1, and the second is at position 5. Then, the distance between the two double bonds is 3 carbons (positions 2,3,4). So when the ring forms, the two alkenes would connect, making a six-membered ring.

But wait, the options have 1,7; 2,6; 1,6; and 1,7.

Wait, maybe the correct starting material would have the two double bonds in such a way that when the ring forms, the substituents are correctly positioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

If this undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the 1-2 and 6-7 double bonds would break, and the ends would connect. So, the 2nd carbon would connect to the 6th, and the 1st to the 7th. Hmm, but that might form a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let's try to count. The starting material is octa-1,6-diene.

So, positions 1-2 double bond, and 6-7 double bond.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2

But that's without substituents. But in our case, substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, substituents are on carbons 3,4,5: methyl groups at 3 and 4, isopropyl at 5.

So, the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH=CH2

Now, when metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, and then re-form the double bonds in a way that connects the ends.

So, the new double bond would form between, say, the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) and the 6th carbon (from the second double bond). Or perhaps the 1st and 7th?

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the metathesis works. The Grubbs catalyst would take the two alkenes and perform a cross metathesis. So, the two alkenes would exchange their ends.

In the case of 1,6-diene, the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So, the two alkenes would break into two parts each. The metathesis would exchange the ends. So, the 1-2 would split into CH2- and -CH2, and the 6-7 would split into CH2- and -CH2.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Each alkene has two ends: for 1-2, the ends are CH2- and CH-. For 6-7, the ends are CH- and CH2.

During metathesis, the catalyst would break both alkenes and recombine the ends. So, the 1 end (CH2-) would connect to the 6 end (CH-), and the 2 end (CH-) would connect to the 7 end (CH2). Wait, but that might not form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the way it works is that the catalyst causes the ends of the alkenes to exchange. So, the 1 (CH2-) end could swap with the 7 (CH2) end, and the 2 (CH-) could swap with the 6 (CH-) end. But how does that form a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis forms a new ring by connecting the two alkenes. So, in the starting material, the two alkenes are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. When the ring forms, the 2nd carbon (from the first alkene) connects to the 7th carbon (from the second alkene), and the 1st carbon (from the first) connects to the 6th.

Wait, that would form a ring. How many members would that be? Let's count: from 2 to 7, that's 5 carbons apart. So, the ring would have 5+1 = 6 members. Oh, that makes sense!

So, if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, then the two alkenes are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The ring forms by connecting the 2nd carbon to the 7th, and the 1st to the 6th. So, the ring would have the positions:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (but wait, 6 is connected to 1, so it's a six-membered ring).

Wait, perhaps the ring would have the following structure: starting from the 1st carbon, connected to 6th, which is followed by 5, 4, 3, 2, and back to 1. Or maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

But importantly, the substituents on the starting material would end up at the correct positions in the ring. Let me see: substituents are at 3,4,5. In the ring, these would correspond to positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. That matches the target molecule.

So, the starting material with 1,6-diene would form the correct ring. So, which option is that?

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Yes, that's the correct one.

Wait, let me double-check with the other options.

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So double bonds at 2 and 6.

If you form a ring by connecting 2 and 6, that would create a five-membered ring, which isn't the target (which is six-membered). So that's probably not the right option.

Option D is 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So substituents at 4,5,6. When the ring forms, would that position correctly? Probably not, because the substituents would end up elsewhere.

Option A is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. If the ring forms by connecting 1 and 7, that would create a six-membered ring? Wait, let's see: starting from 1, connecting to 7, which is in position 7 of an eight-carbon chain. Wait, 1 and 7 are six carbons apart (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7). So connecting 1 and 7 would form a six-membered ring?

Wait, the chain is 8 carbons. So, the distance from 1 to 7 is 6 (since 1,2,3,4,5,6,7). So the ring would be 6+ (the connecting points?), which may form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The starting material for option A is 1,7-diene.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene is eight carbons. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2

Wait, but that's if the substituents are at 3,4,5.

Wait, when you have 1,7-diene, the two alkenes are at the very ends. So, when metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break both alkenes and form a new double bond between the two ends.

So, the 1 end (CH2=CH-) would connect to the 7 end (CH2=CH2?), but that seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formed would have six members if the starting material's diene is 1,7-diene. Because the distance between the two alkenes is 5 carbons (since 1 to 7 is 6 positions, so 5 carbons in between? Not sure.

In any case, if the correct starting material is option C, which is 1,6-diene, then that would form the six-membered ring correctly. Because the substituents are at 3,4,5, which would end up in the same positions in the ring.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the options based on the mechanism of the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments to form a cyclic structure. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

The starting material must be an octadiene with two double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the ends of the chain form a six-membered ring with the substituents correctly positioned at 3, 4, and 5. The key is to identify the diene structure where the substituents align with the target molecule's substituents after the ring forms.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents (methyl at 3, methyl at 4, and isopropyl at 5) are correctly positioned. However, the distance between the double bonds is too great (positions 1 and 7), which would result in a ring larger than six members. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The substituents are correctly positioned, but the double bonds are too close together. This would result in a five-membered ring, not the six-membered cyclohexene required. Thus, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents (methyl at 3, methyl at 4, and isopropyl at 5) are correctly positioned. The distance between the double bonds is ideal for forming a six-membered ring. Upon ring-closing metathesis, the ends of the diene will form a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions. This matches the target molecule, making this the correct option.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are misplaced (isopropyl at 4, methyl at 5, and methyl at 6). These substituents would not align with the target molecule's substituents after ring formation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the correct substituents and double bond positions to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments.

The substituents are: at position 3, a methyl group; at position 4, another methyl; and at position 5, an isopropyl group. Oh wait, and the double bond is at position 1-2, since it's cyclohex-1-ene.

If the molecule is octa-1,7-diene, then the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

At position 3: CH(CH3)

Position 4: CH(CH3)

Position 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)

Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about how the ring forms. When you have a diene like 1,7-octadiene, the ends (1 and 7) are the ends of the chain. When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break each double bond, and the ends would connect.

Oh, because in the metathesis process, two alkenes are in the same molecule, and when the ring forms, the two alkenes are repositioned. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene that, when the metathesis occurs, forms the cyclohexene plus two ethylene molecules? No, I don't think so. Because Grubbs catalyst is for olefin metathesis, which exchanges the ends of alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are positioned such that when the ring is formed, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to model the correct option.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So, substituents at positions 3,4,5.

So, in the starting material (which is an octadiene), these substituents should be in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has the substituents in positions that, when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms between the two ends, bringing the substituents to their positions.

So, for example, in the starting material, the substituents (methyl and isopropyl) are on carbons that will end up in positions 3,4,5 when the ring forms.

So, imagine the starting material is a linear molecule with double bonds at certain positions, with substituents placed in such a way that after ring formation, they are correctly placed.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the substituents are at positions 3 (CH3), 4 (CH3), 5 (CH(CH2CH3)2). The double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8.

If this undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 7) would form the ring. So, the ring would have six members: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 (since 1 connects to 7, which is now position 6 in the ring? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to think about this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, maybe I should write it as:

The molecule is 5-isopropyl etc. So, substituents at 3,4,5.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2

Wait, but I might be getting the substituents misplaced. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Positions 1,2: CH2=CH-

Position 3: CH2- with a methyl group (3- CH(CH3))

Position 4: CH(CH3)

Position 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, so the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

But then, the double bonds are at 1 and 7. So positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst will facilitate the exchange of the ends. The 1,2 double bond and the 7,8 double bond would break, and the ends would connect. So, the 1 (CH2=CH-) would connect to the 8 (CH2), and the 2 would connect to the 7.

Wait, but how does that form a ring? Let me think. When the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the four carbons (positions 1,2 and 7,8) would form a new double bond. So, in this case, the ring would be formed by connecting the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) to the 7th carbon (from the second double bond). Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis forms a new double bond between the ends of the diene. So, the starting material is 1,7-diene. So, the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The ring would form by connecting the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) to the 7th carbon (from the second double bond), and the 1st carbon would connect to the 8th, but that seems a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the ring is formed by taking the two ends of the diene and connecting them. So, the 1st and 7th positions would form the ring. But that would require that the distance between them is such that the ring is six-membered.

Wait, the chain is eight carbons. So, if I connect the 1st and 7th, that's a five-carbon bridge, but that would form a five-membered ring, not six. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting material as having the two double bonds in positions that are four carbons apart. So, for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes are separated by four carbons. Because when you form the ring, each end of the alkenes becomes adjacent in the ring.

So, for example, in the starting material, the first double bond is at position 1, and the second is at position 5. Then, the distance between the two double bonds is 3 carbons (positions 2,3,4). So when the ring forms, the two alkenes would connect, making a six-membered ring.

But wait, the options have 1,7; 2,6; 1,6; and 1,7.

Wait, maybe the correct starting material would have the two double bonds in such a way that when the ring forms, the substituents are correctly positioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

If this undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the 1-2 and 6-7 double bonds would break, and the ends would connect. So, the 2nd carbon would connect to the 6th, and the 1st to the 7th. Hmm, but that might form a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let's try to count. The starting material is octa-1,6-diene.

So, positions 1-2 double bond, and 6-7 double bond.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2

But that's without substituents. But in our case, substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, substituents are on carbons 3,4,5: methyl groups at 3 and 4, isopropyl at 5.

So, the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH=CH2

Now, when metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, and then re-form the double bonds in a way that connects the ends.

So, the new double bond would form between, say, the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) and the 6th carbon (from the second double bond). Or perhaps the 1st and 7th?

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the metathesis works. The Grubbs catalyst would take the two alkenes and perform a cross metathesis. So, the two alkenes would exchange their ends.

In the case of 1,6-diene, the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So, the two alkenes would break into two parts each. The metathesis would exchange the ends. So, the 1-2 would split into CH2- and -CH2, and the 6-7 would split into CH2- and -CH2.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Each alkene has two ends: for 1-2, the ends are CH2- and CH-. For 6-7, the ends are CH- and CH2.

During metathesis, the catalyst would break both alkenes and recombine the ends. So, the 1 end (CH2-) would connect to the 6 end (CH-), and the 2 end (CH-) would connect to the 7 end (CH2). Wait, but that might not form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the way it works is that the catalyst causes the ends of the alkenes to exchange. So, the 1 (CH2-) end could swap with the 7 (CH2) end, and the 2 (CH-) could swap with the 6 (CH-) end. But how does that form a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis forms a new ring by connecting the two alkenes. So, in the starting material, the two alkenes are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. When the ring forms, the 2nd carbon (from the first alkene) connects to the 7th carbon (from the second alkene), and the 1st carbon (from the first) connects to the 6th.

Wait, that would form a ring. How many members would that be? Let's count: from 2 to 7, that's 5 carbons apart. So, the ring would have 5+1 = 6 members. Oh, that makes sense!

So, if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, then the two alkenes are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The ring forms by connecting the 2nd carbon to the 7th, and the 1st to the 6th. So, the ring would have the positions:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (but wait, 6 is connected to 1, so it's a six-membered ring).

Wait, perhaps the ring would have the following structure: starting from the 1st carbon, connected to 6th, which is followed by 5, 4, 3, 2, and back to 1. Or maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

But importantly, the substituents on the starting material would end up at the correct positions in the ring. Let me see: substituents are at 3,4,5. In the ring, these would correspond to positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. That matches the target molecule.

So, the starting material with 1,6-diene would form the correct ring. So, which option is that?

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Yes, that's the correct one.

Wait, let me double-check with the other options.

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So double bonds at 2 and 6.

If you form a ring by connecting 2 and 6, that would create a five-membered ring, which isn't the target (which is six-membered). So that's probably not the right option.

Option D is 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So substituents at 4,5,6. When the ring forms, would that position correctly? Probably not, because the substituents would end up elsewhere.

Option A is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. If the ring forms by connecting 1 and 7, that would create a six-membered ring? Wait, let's see: starting from 1, connecting to 7, which is in position 7 of an eight-carbon chain. Wait, 1 and 7 are six carbons apart (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7). So connecting 1 and 7 would form a six-membered ring?

Wait, the chain is 8 carbons. So, the distance from 1 to 7 is 6 (since 1,2,3,4,5,6,7). So the ring would be 6+ (the connecting points?), which may form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The starting material for option A is 1,7-diene.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene is eight carbons. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2

Wait, but that's if the substituents are at 3,4,5.

Wait, when you have 1,7-diene, the two alkenes are at the very ends. So, when metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break both alkenes and form a new double bond between the two ends.

So, the 1 end (CH2=CH-) would connect to the 7 end (CH2=CH2?), but that seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formed would have six members if the starting material's diene is 1,7-diene. Because the distance between the two alkenes is 5 carbons (since 1 to 7 is 6 positions, so 5 carbons in between? Not sure.

In any case, if the correct starting material is option C, which is 1,6-diene, then that would form the six-membered ring correctly. Because the substituents are at 3,4,5, which would end up in the same positions in the ring.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the options based on the mechanism of the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments to form a cyclic structure. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

The starting material must be an octadiene with two double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the ends of the chain form a six-membered ring with the substituents correctly positioned at 3, 4, and 5. The key is to identify the diene structure where the substituents align with the target molecule's substituents after the ring forms.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents (methyl at 3, methyl at 4, and isopropyl at 5) are correctly positioned. However, the distance between the double bonds is too great (positions 1 and 7), which would result in a ring larger than six members. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The substituents are correctly positioned, but the double bonds are too close together. This would result in a five-membered ring, not the six-membered cyclohexene required. Thus, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents (methyl at 3, methyl at 4, and isopropyl at 5) are correctly positioned. The distance between the double bonds is ideal for forming a six-membered ring. Upon ring-closing metathesis, the ends of the diene will form a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions. This matches the target molecule, making this the correct option.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are misplaced (isopropyl at 4, methyl at 5, and methyl at 6). These substituents would not align with the target molecule's substituents after ring formation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the correct substituents and double bond positions to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.
