Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question states that there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, both detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star they orbit has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radius, and a Teff of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 times Earth's. Both have circular orbits and the same albedo. We're supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 over Planet2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's calculated based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Or wait, maybe it's (L / (16π²σ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1-A)^(1/4) remains.

But wait, the star's Teff is given. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So maybe I can compute L for the star and then use that in the equilibrium temperature formula.

But wait, equilibrium temperature also depends on the distance from the star. How do I get the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis, but in this question, they've given the Doppler shifts for each planet in the [OI] line. Hmm, Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * 1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ... wait, no, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital period and other parameters. But maybe I can relate the RV shifts (given in Å) to the velocities and then find the semi-major axis.

Oh wait, the Doppler shift, or the RV semi-amplitude K, is related to the velocity of the star. Each planet causes a shift in the star's spectrum. The maximum shift is given for each planet — Planet1 causes 0.03 Å, Planet2 0.04 Å. 

But wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the velocity? The formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity towards or away from us. So delta_lambda = v * (lambda / c). 

Wait, but the [OI] line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å. So v1 = (0.03 Å) / (6300 Å) ) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. Let me compute these velocities.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s. Let me calculate that: 0.03 /6300 = 5e-6. 5e-6 * 3e5 = 1.5 km/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04/6300) *3e5 = (4e-5 * 3e5) = ~1.2 * (3e5 * 4e-5) → 3e5 is 300,000, 4e-5 *3e5 = (4e-5)*(3e5) = 12 → 12 km/s? Wait, no, 0.04/6300 is 4e-5, so 4e-5 * 3e5 = (4 *3) * (1e-5 *1e5) )=12*1=12. So v2 is 12 km/s?

Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me compute more accurately.

v1: 0.03 /6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.7619e-9 c? Wait no, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å over lambda of 6300 Å. So delta_lambda/lambda is 0.03/6300 = 4.7619e-6. So the velocity v is (delta_lambda/lambda) * c. c is 3e5 km/s, so v1 = 4.7619e-6 * 3e5 km/s ≈ 1.42857 km/s.

Similarly, v2: 0.04 /6300 = 6.349e-6. v2 = 6.349e-6 *3e5 = 19.047 km/s. Wait, wait, wait, no. 0.04 /6300 = 0.000006349, so 6.349e-6. Multiply by 3e5 km/s, gives 6.349e-6 * 3e5 = (6.349 *3) * (1e-6 *1e5)= 19.047 * 0.1=1.9047 km/s. Wait, no, 1e-6 *1e5 is 1e-1. So 6.349e-6 *3e5 = (6.349 *3) * (1e-6 +5) = 19.047 *1e-1 = 1.9047 km/s.

Wait that can't be right. 0.03/6300 is 4.76e-6. So 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = (4.76 *3e5) *1e-6 → 4.76 * 0.3 → approximately 1.428 km/s.

So Planet1's RV semi-amplitude is 1.428 km/s, Planet2's is 1.9047 km/s.

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * [ ... ] Hmm, maybe I should use the simplified version where M_p is much less than M_star, which is the case here.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )? Wait, maybe I should look for a better formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

K = ( ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, I can use the approximation:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the relation between the semi-major axes of the two planets using their RV semi-amplitudes.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies. So for each planet, K_p = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to relate the semi-major axes a of each planet since they're in circular orbits.

The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

But again, since e=0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (v) ) = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe there's a way to relate the RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 to their respective semi-major axes a1 and a2.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * (1/sin i). But without knowing P or i, this might complicate things.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Since both planets are causing Doppler shifts, which relate to their masses and orbital periods. But without knowing the periods, maybe we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes a1 and a2.

Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1 / (P^(1/3)) ]

Hmm, but without the period P, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_star + M_p) / (4π²). But since M_p << M_star, it's approximately a^3 = G M_star P²/(4π²). 

But again, without knowing P, this might not help. Wait, but maybe we can relate the semi-major axes a1 and a2 using the RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2.

Wait, let me write the formula for K again, in terms of a.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3)

But since e=0, and sin i is the same for both planets (assuming same inclination, which I think is a fair assumption as they're in the same system and detected with the same method), we can write K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1) / M_p2 )^(1) ]^(1/3) * [ (P1 / P2 )^( -1/3 ) ]

But without knowing the periods, it's unclear. Hmm.

Wait another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (G/(4π²))^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / (1 - e²)^(1/2)

But since e=0, and sin i is same for both, perhaps K ∝ (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

But from Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M_star + M_p)) ) → approximately (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) → P = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting that into K:

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 ) )

Simplify the denominator:

Denominator becomes M_star^(2/3) * (4π² a³)^(1/6) / (G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) )

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead find the ratio of a1 to a2.

Because equilibrium temperature depends on a, the distance from the star. So if I can find a1 and a2, I can compute their equilibrium temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shifts relate to the velocities, which in turn relate to the orbital periods and semi-major axes. But without knowing the periods, maybe I can find the ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, let's think about RV semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i is same for both (so sin i is same, but for the same system, perhaps i is similar).

But without knowing P, this is tricky. Unless I can relate K1 and K2 through their masses and the ratio of P1 and P2.

But wait, maybe the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) can be related to the ratio of their masses and the cube roots of their orbital periods.

Wait, perhaps I can write K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But without knowing P1 and P2, it's not helpful. Unless I can relate P1 and P2 through the masses, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the planet's mass and the distance.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity. So for each planet, velocity v = K (the semi-amplitude) gives the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Wait, the star's velocity (v) is given by the RV method. The formula for v is:

v = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) )

But again, without knowing P, not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Since the question gives the Doppler shifts in the same spectral line, perhaps the shift is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Wait, no, the Doppler shift is delta_lambda = (v / c) * lambda.

So, delta_lambda is proportional to v.

So, for a given spectral line at wavelength lambda, the Doppler shift (delta_lambda) is proportional to the velocity v.

So, if Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å and Planet2 0.04 Å, then their velocities are in the ratio 0.03 : 0.04, which is 3:4.

So v1 = 3u, v2=4u. 

But what determines the velocity of the star? The star's velocity depends on the planet's mass, the semi-major axis (distance), and the orbital period.

Wait, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But again, without knowing P, it's unclear.

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_p) / (4π²). Since M_p << M_star, it's a³ ∝ P² M_star.

So P = sqrt( a³ / ( G M_star ) ) * (4π²)^(1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps if I can express P in terms of a, I can find a relation between a1 and a2.

But it's getting a bit tangled. Let me see.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

But without knowing P, perhaps I can express P in terms of a via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star). So, P = sqrt(4π² a³/(G M_star)).

So, P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = [ (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) )^(1/6 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify denominator inside:

Denominator terms: M_star^(1/3) * (4π² a³)^(1/6) / (G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6)) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the exponents. Let's try:

Denominator inside the fraction:

= M_star^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) / ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) )

= (4π²)^(1/6) * a^(1/2) * M_star^( (1/3) - (1/6) ) / G^(1/6 )

= (4π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6) / G^(1/6 )

So, combining the terms:

K = [ G M_p sin i / ( ... ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the ratio K1/K2.

We have K1 = (v1) = 0.03/6300 * c ≈ 1.428e3 m/s? Wait, earlier calculation in km/s was 1.428 km/s. K2 is 1.9047 km/s.

So K1/K2 ≈ 1.428 / 1.9047 ≈ 0.75.

So the ratio of K1 to K2 is about 0.75.

Earlier, I thought K is proportional to (M_p / a^{1/2} )^(something). Hmm.

Wait, from the above, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6) ) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p / a^{1/2} ) * (something with M_star and other constants). 

But maybe instead of getting stuck in the weeds, I can think about the equilibrium temperature formula.

The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo A, and e=0, this simplifies to:

T_eq ∝ T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

So, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if I can find the ratio a1/a2, I can find the ratio T1/T2.

So, let's find a1 and a2.

But how? From the RV data.

We have K1 and K2. K is the velocity semi-amplitude of the star. K depends on the mass of the planet, the semi-major axis, and the period.

Wait, from the RV formula, K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star) → P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

So plugging that into K:

K = ( (G M_p sin i ) / M_star^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) / [ (4π² a³/(G M_star) )^(1/6 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (G M_p sin i )^(1/3) ] / [ M_star^(2/9) ] * [ (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4π² a³)^(1/6) ) ]

= (G M_p sin i )^(1/3) * (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / ( M_star^(2/9) * (4π² a³ )^(1/6) ) )

Hmm, this is getting too messy. Perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K.

Alternatively, let me write the formula for K again:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) )

Assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this becomes:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

From Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star) → P = (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2 )

So, P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) = (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/6 )

Substituting back into K:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/6) ) )

= (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i / [ M_star^(2/3) * (4π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) (G M_star)^(-1/6) ) ]

Simplify denominator terms:

M_star^(2/3) * (G M_star )^(-1/6) = M_star^( (4/6 - 1/6) ) = M_star^(1/2 )

And 4π²^(1/6) is (2² π²)^(1/6) )= 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)

So denominator: 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2 )

Putting it all together:

K ≈ [ (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2π G = 2 * π * G

So numerator: (2π G )^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) (π)^(1/3) G^(1/3 )

Denominator: 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2 )

So,

K ≈ [ (2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) ) * M_p sin i ] / [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify the 2^(1/3) and π^(1/3) terms cancel out.

So,

K ≈ ( G^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

= G^(1/3) M_p sin i / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

But sin i is same for both planets, so:

K ∝ M_p / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

So, K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/2 )

We can rearrange this to find (a1/a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2 )² * ( K2 / K1 )² )

So,

a1/a2 = ( ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( ( K2 / K1 )^2 )

Plugging in the values,

M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.

So,

(M_p1 / M_p2 ) =7/5 =1.4

K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.9047 km/s. So K2/K1= 1.9047 /1.428 ≈1.334.

So,

(a1/a2) = (1.4)^2 * (1.334)^2 = (1.96) * (1.779556) ≈ 3.493.

Wait, but (1.4)^2 is 1.96, and (1.333333)^2 is approximately 1.7778.

So 1.96 * 1.7778 ≈ around 3.49.

Wait, but wait, let's compute it accurately.

1.334 squared is (1.334)^2 = (1 + 0.334)^2 = 1 + 2*0.334 + 0.334^2 = 1 + 0.668 + 0.111556 ≈ 1.779556.

So 1.96 * 1.779556 = let's compute:

1.96 *1.779556 ≈ (2 -0.04) *1.779556 = 3.559112 - 0.07118224 ≈ 3.48793.

So a1/a2 ≈3.48793.

So a1 is about 3.488 times a2. So a1 = 3.488 a2.

But equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1 / 3.488 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2866) ≈ 0.535.

Wait, but wait: T_eq ∝ 1/√a. So T1 = T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 a1) ), T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 a2) ) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.488) ≈ 0.535.

Hmm, that's about 0.535, so the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is about 0.535, so T1 is about 0.535 times T2. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which fits. So the answer should be C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) and \(R_{\text{star}}\) are the effective temperature and radius of the star, respectively, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the inverse square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The semi-major axes \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be determined using the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\), which are related to the planets' masses and orbital distances. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^2
\]

Given:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_2 = 1.9047 \, \text{km/s}\)

First, calculate the mass ratio:

\[
\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Next, calculate the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{1.9047}{1.428} \approx 1.334
\]

Now, compute the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = (1.4)^2 \cdot (1.334)^2 = 1.96 \cdot 1.7796 \approx 3.49
\]

Finally, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.49}} \approx \sqrt{0.2866} \approx 0.535
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is approximately 0.53 times that of Planet2. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.53**

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question states that there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, both detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star they orbit has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radius, and a Teff of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 times Earth's. Both have circular orbits and the same albedo. We're supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 over Planet2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's calculated based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Or wait, maybe it's (L / (16π²σ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1-A)^(1/4) remains.

But wait, the star's Teff is given. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So maybe I can compute L for the star and then use that in the equilibrium temperature formula.

But wait, equilibrium temperature also depends on the distance from the star. How do I get the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis, but in this question, they've given the Doppler shifts for each planet in the [OI] line. Hmm, Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * 1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ... wait, no, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital period and other parameters. But maybe I can relate the RV shifts (given in Å) to the velocities and then find the semi-major axis.

Oh wait, the Doppler shift, or the RV semi-amplitude K, is related to the velocity of the star. Each planet causes a shift in the star's spectrum. The maximum shift is given for each planet — Planet1 causes 0.03 Å, Planet2 0.04 Å. 

But wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the velocity? The formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity towards or away from us. So delta_lambda = v * (lambda / c). 

Wait, but the [OI] line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å. So v1 = (0.03 Å) / (6300 Å) ) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. Let me compute these velocities.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s. Let me calculate that: 0.03 /6300 = 5e-6. 5e-6 * 3e5 = 1.5 km/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04/6300) *3e5 = (4e-5 * 3e5) = ~1.2 * (3e5 * 4e-5) → 3e5 is 300,000, 4e-5 *3e5 = (4e-5)*(3e5) = 12 → 12 km/s? Wait, no, 0.04/6300 is 4e-5, so 4e-5 * 3e5 = (4 *3) * (1e-5 *1e5) )=12*1=12. So v2 is 12 km/s?

Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me compute more accurately.

v1: 0.03 /6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.7619e-9 c? Wait no, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å over lambda of 6300 Å. So delta_lambda/lambda is 0.03/6300 = 4.7619e-6. So the velocity v is (delta_lambda/lambda) * c. c is 3e5 km/s, so v1 = 4.7619e-6 * 3e5 km/s ≈ 1.42857 km/s.

Similarly, v2: 0.04 /6300 = 6.349e-6. v2 = 6.349e-6 *3e5 = 19.047 km/s. Wait, wait, wait, no. 0.04 /6300 = 0.000006349, so 6.349e-6. Multiply by 3e5 km/s, gives 6.349e-6 * 3e5 = (6.349 *3) * (1e-6 *1e5)= 19.047 * 0.1=1.9047 km/s. Wait, no, 1e-6 *1e5 is 1e-1. So 6.349e-6 *3e5 = (6.349 *3) * (1e-6 +5) = 19.047 *1e-1 = 1.9047 km/s.

Wait that can't be right. 0.03/6300 is 4.76e-6. So 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = (4.76 *3e5) *1e-6 → 4.76 * 0.3 → approximately 1.428 km/s.

So Planet1's RV semi-amplitude is 1.428 km/s, Planet2's is 1.9047 km/s.

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * [ ... ] Hmm, maybe I should use the simplified version where M_p is much less than M_star, which is the case here.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )? Wait, maybe I should look for a better formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

K = ( ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, I can use the approximation:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the relation between the semi-major axes of the two planets using their RV semi-amplitudes.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies. So for each planet, K_p = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to relate the semi-major axes a of each planet since they're in circular orbits.

The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

But again, since e=0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (v) ) = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe there's a way to relate the RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 to their respective semi-major axes a1 and a2.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * (1/sin i). But without knowing P or i, this might complicate things.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Since both planets are causing Doppler shifts, which relate to their masses and orbital periods. But without knowing the periods, maybe we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes a1 and a2.

Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1 / (P^(1/3)) ]

Hmm, but without the period P, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_star + M_p) / (4π²). But since M_p << M_star, it's approximately a^3 = G M_star P²/(4π²). 

But again, without knowing P, this might not help. Wait, but maybe we can relate the semi-major axes a1 and a2 using the RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2.

Wait, let me write the formula for K again, in terms of a.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3)

But since e=0, and sin i is the same for both planets (assuming same inclination, which I think is a fair assumption as they're in the same system and detected with the same method), we can write K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1) / M_p2 )^(1) ]^(1/3) * [ (P1 / P2 )^( -1/3 ) ]

But without knowing the periods, it's unclear. Hmm.

Wait another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (G/(4π²))^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / (1 - e²)^(1/2)

But since e=0, and sin i is same for both, perhaps K ∝ (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

But from Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M_star + M_p)) ) → approximately (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) → P = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting that into K:

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 ) )

Simplify the denominator:

Denominator becomes M_star^(2/3) * (4π² a³)^(1/6) / (G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) )

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead find the ratio of a1 to a2.

Because equilibrium temperature depends on a, the distance from the star. So if I can find a1 and a2, I can compute their equilibrium temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shifts relate to the velocities, which in turn relate to the orbital periods and semi-major axes. But without knowing the periods, maybe I can find the ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, let's think about RV semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i is same for both (so sin i is same, but for the same system, perhaps i is similar).

But without knowing P, this is tricky. Unless I can relate K1 and K2 through their masses and the ratio of P1 and P2.

But wait, maybe the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) can be related to the ratio of their masses and the cube roots of their orbital periods.

Wait, perhaps I can write K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But without knowing P1 and P2, it's not helpful. Unless I can relate P1 and P2 through the masses, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the planet's mass and the distance.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity. So for each planet, velocity v = K (the semi-amplitude) gives the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Wait, the star's velocity (v) is given by the RV method. The formula for v is:

v = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) )

But again, without knowing P, not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Since the question gives the Doppler shifts in the same spectral line, perhaps the shift is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Wait, no, the Doppler shift is delta_lambda = (v / c) * lambda.

So, delta_lambda is proportional to v.

So, for a given spectral line at wavelength lambda, the Doppler shift (delta_lambda) is proportional to the velocity v.

So, if Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å and Planet2 0.04 Å, then their velocities are in the ratio 0.03 : 0.04, which is 3:4.

So v1 = 3u, v2=4u. 

But what determines the velocity of the star? The star's velocity depends on the planet's mass, the semi-major axis (distance), and the orbital period.

Wait, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But again, without knowing P, it's unclear.

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_p) / (4π²). Since M_p << M_star, it's a³ ∝ P² M_star.

So P = sqrt( a³ / ( G M_star ) ) * (4π²)^(1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps if I can express P in terms of a, I can find a relation between a1 and a2.

But it's getting a bit tangled. Let me see.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

But without knowing P, perhaps I can express P in terms of a via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star). So, P = sqrt(4π² a³/(G M_star)).

So, P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = [ (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) )^(1/6 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify denominator inside:

Denominator terms: M_star^(1/3) * (4π² a³)^(1/6) / (G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6)) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the exponents. Let's try:

Denominator inside the fraction:

= M_star^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) / ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) )

= (4π²)^(1/6) * a^(1/2) * M_star^( (1/3) - (1/6) ) / G^(1/6 )

= (4π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6) / G^(1/6 )

So, combining the terms:

K = [ G M_p sin i / ( ... ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the ratio K1/K2.

We have K1 = (v1) = 0.03/6300 * c ≈ 1.428e3 m/s? Wait, earlier calculation in km/s was 1.428 km/s. K2 is 1.9047 km/s.

So K1/K2 ≈ 1.428 / 1.9047 ≈ 0.75.

So the ratio of K1 to K2 is about 0.75.

Earlier, I thought K is proportional to (M_p / a^{1/2} )^(something). Hmm.

Wait, from the above, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6) ) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p / a^{1/2} ) * (something with M_star and other constants). 

But maybe instead of getting stuck in the weeds, I can think about the equilibrium temperature formula.

The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo A, and e=0, this simplifies to:

T_eq ∝ T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

So, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if I can find the ratio a1/a2, I can find the ratio T1/T2.

So, let's find a1 and a2.

But how? From the RV data.

We have K1 and K2. K is the velocity semi-amplitude of the star. K depends on the mass of the planet, the semi-major axis, and the period.

Wait, from the RV formula, K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star) → P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

So plugging that into K:

K = ( (G M_p sin i ) / M_star^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) / [ (4π² a³/(G M_star) )^(1/6 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (G M_p sin i )^(1/3) ] / [ M_star^(2/9) ] * [ (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4π² a³)^(1/6) ) ]

= (G M_p sin i )^(1/3) * (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / ( M_star^(2/9) * (4π² a³ )^(1/6) ) )

Hmm, this is getting too messy. Perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K.

Alternatively, let me write the formula for K again:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) )

Assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this becomes:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

From Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star) → P = (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2 )

So, P^(1/3) = [ (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) = (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/6 )

Substituting back into K:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/6) ) )

= (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i / [ M_star^(2/3) * (4π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) (G M_star)^(-1/6) ) ]

Simplify denominator terms:

M_star^(2/3) * (G M_star )^(-1/6) = M_star^( (4/6 - 1/6) ) = M_star^(1/2 )

And 4π²^(1/6) is (2² π²)^(1/6) )= 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)

So denominator: 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2 )

Putting it all together:

K ≈ [ (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2π G = 2 * π * G

So numerator: (2π G )^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) (π)^(1/3) G^(1/3 )

Denominator: 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2 )

So,

K ≈ [ (2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) ) * M_p sin i ] / [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify the 2^(1/3) and π^(1/3) terms cancel out.

So,

K ≈ ( G^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

= G^(1/3) M_p sin i / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

But sin i is same for both planets, so:

K ∝ M_p / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

So, K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/2 )

We can rearrange this to find (a1/a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2 )² * ( K2 / K1 )² )

So,

a1/a2 = ( ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( ( K2 / K1 )^2 )

Plugging in the values,

M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.

So,

(M_p1 / M_p2 ) =7/5 =1.4

K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.9047 km/s. So K2/K1= 1.9047 /1.428 ≈1.334.

So,

(a1/a2) = (1.4)^2 * (1.334)^2 = (1.96) * (1.779556) ≈ 3.493.

Wait, but (1.4)^2 is 1.96, and (1.333333)^2 is approximately 1.7778.

So 1.96 * 1.7778 ≈ around 3.49.

Wait, but wait, let's compute it accurately.

1.334 squared is (1.334)^2 = (1 + 0.334)^2 = 1 + 2*0.334 + 0.334^2 = 1 + 0.668 + 0.111556 ≈ 1.779556.

So 1.96 * 1.779556 = let's compute:

1.96 *1.779556 ≈ (2 -0.04) *1.779556 = 3.559112 - 0.07118224 ≈ 3.48793.

So a1/a2 ≈3.48793.

So a1 is about 3.488 times a2. So a1 = 3.488 a2.

But equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1 / 3.488 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2866) ≈ 0.535.

Wait, but wait: T_eq ∝ 1/√a. So T1 = T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 a1) ), T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 a2) ) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.488) ≈ 0.535.

Hmm, that's about 0.535, so the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is about 0.535, so T1 is about 0.535 times T2. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which fits. So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) and \(R_{\text{star}}\) are the effective temperature and radius of the star, respectively, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the inverse square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The semi-major axes \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be determined using the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\), which are related to the planets' masses and orbital distances. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^2
\]

Given:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_2 = 1.9047 \, \text{km/s}\)

First, calculate the mass ratio:

\[
\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Next, calculate the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{1.9047}{1.428} \approx 1.334
\]

Now, compute the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = (1.4)^2 \cdot (1.334)^2 = 1.96 \cdot 1.7796 \approx 3.49
\]

Finally, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.49}} \approx \sqrt{0.2866} \approx 0.535
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is approximately 0.53 times that of Planet2. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.53**

Answer: C
