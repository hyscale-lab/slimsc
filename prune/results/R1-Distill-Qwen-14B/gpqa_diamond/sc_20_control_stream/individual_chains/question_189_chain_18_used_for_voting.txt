Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetries. Hmm, I need to figure out which one isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Let me think through each option.

First, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking happens when the system's vacuum (ground state) doesn't exhibit the same symmetry as the equations governing it. The particles that emerge from this are called Goldstone bosons. Oh right, like pions are Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. So D) Pion is definitely associated with broken symmetry.

Now, option A) Phonon. Phonons are related to sound waves in solids, right? They're quantized vibrations of the crystal lattice. I think in crystals, the translational symmetry is broken because the atoms are in a periodic lattice. But wait, phonons arise from the breaking of translational symmetry? Or maybe not. Wait, no, the phonon is a boson from the quantized wave in a crystal. But the original symmetry might not be exact in the ground state. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe phonons are a result of broken symmetry in the solid state, but I'm not certain. I'll come back to this.

Option B) Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They're used to model certain particles, like in the Skyrme model for pions. Skyrmions arise due to the breaking of chiral symmetry, I believe. So they are tied to broken symmetry. So B is associated, so not the answer.

Option C) Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles for spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise from the quantization of spin waves. In ferromagnetic materials, the spin is ordered, which breaks rotational symmetry. So the magnon is a Goldstone boson for the broken spin rotation symmetry. So C is associated with broken symmetry, so not the answer.

Wait, so the question is which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are A (phonon), B (skyrmion), C (magnon), D (pion). Based on what I thought, D is definitely a Goldstone boson (from chiral symmetry breaking), B is a topological soliton from broken symmetry, C is a Goldstone boson from spin symmetry breaking.

So that leaves A) Phonon. Are phonons Goldstone bosons? Because in a crystal, the translation symmetry is broken, but the phonon is a boson that's a result of that. Wait, in a solid, the ground state has broken translational symmetry (since it's a crystal with lattice), so the original continuous translational symmetry is broken to a discrete one. So the Goldstone theorem would predict massless bosons for each broken generator. In this case, the generators of translations are broken, so we get phonons as the Goldstone bosons. But wait, phonons are massive in 3D? Oh, right, in 3D, the Goldstone bosons (phonons) are massless only at long wavelengths. Wait, but in 3D, the phonon has a dispersion relation that's linear at low energies, so they are massless in that limit. So phonons are Goldstone bosons. So they are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, but wait a minute. Goldstone's theorem applies when there's a continuous symmetry. In a crystal, the translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry (like translation by any amount). But when it's broken to a discrete lattice, the continuous symmetry is broken, leading to Goldstone bosons. So phonons are indeed Goldstone bosons. So all four options A-D are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. But the question asks which is NOT. Oh wait, that can't be, because the question says "which is not associated".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Are phonons considered Goldstone bosons? Another thought: in a solid, the phonons arise from the lattice vibrations, which come from the discrete translational symmetry. But maybe the original symmetry is not a gauge symmetry but a global one. So Goldstone's theorem says that for each broken generator, a massless boson arises. So phonons would be Goldstone bosons, hence associated with a broken symmetry.

Wait, but maybe in some cases, like in the case of phonons, the symmetry is not spontaneously broken but explicitly broken. Or perhaps the symmetry is not a global symmetry but a gauge symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about which of these particles are not Goldstone bosons.

Wait, the pion is a Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking. Skyrmion is a topological solution, but I think they're related to broken symmetry. Magnon is a Goldstone boson from spin symmetry breaking. Phonon is a Goldstone boson from translational symmetry breaking. So all four are associated.

But wait, perhaps the phonon doesn't come from a continuous symmetry? No, translational symmetry is continuous. So the broken symmetry is continuous, so phonons are Goldstone bosons.

Hmm, maybe one of the options isn't a Goldstone boson. So which particles are not Goldstone bosons? Let's see:

Pions are Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking.

Magnons are Goldstone bosons of broken spin rotation symmetry.

Skyrmions are more topological, but they are related to the broken chiral symmetry as well. Or perhaps they emerge from a different kind of symmetry breaking.

Wait, Skyrmions are solitons, which arise due to nonlinear realizations and are associated with chiral symmetry breaking. But they are not the Goldstone bosons themselves. Hmm, so maybe Skyrmions are not Goldstone bosons but a different kind of particle arising from the symmetry breaking. So perhaps the question is about which is NOT a Goldstone boson.

Wait no, the question is about which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if Skyrmion is a result of the broken symmetry, then it's associated. So all four are associated, but perhaps one is not.

Wait, perhaps the phonon is not a Goldstone boson? Or perhaps in the case of phonon, the symmetry is not spontaneously broken but explicitly broken. Because in a crystal, the potential has explicit periodicity, so the symmetry is explicitly broken, not spontaneously. Hmm, that's an important point.

Wait, spontaneous symmetry breaking is when the laws (the Lagrangian) are symmetric, but the vacuum isn't. So, for example, in the Mexican hat potential, the symmetry is in the potential, but the vacuum is at a point that breaks the symmetry.

In the case of a crystal, the translational symmetry is explicit in the Hamiltonian because the potential has a periodic lattice structure. So the symmetry isn't broken spontaneously; it's broken explicitly because the system is in a state (crystal) that doesn't respect the symmetry.

Wait, that's a key point! So in the case of phonons, the symmetry is not spontaneously broken but explicitly broken. So phonons don't arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking but from explicit breaking. So the other particles (pion, magnon, skyrmion) are Goldstone bosons from spontaneous symmetry breaking, but phonons are not. That would mean the answer is A) Phonon.

Wait, so if that's the case, then the particles like pion, magnon, and skyrmion (if topological) are from spontaneous symmetry breaking, while phonon is from explicit symmetry breaking. So the answer would be A) Phonon.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, we analyze each option:

1. **Pion (Option D)**: Pions are Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This is a classic example of spontaneous symmetry breaking, so pions are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

2. **Skyrmion (Option B)**: Skyrmions are topological solitons that emerge in the Skyrme model. They are related to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and are thus associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

3. **Magnon (Option C)**: Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in ferromagnetic systems, making them Goldstone bosons tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry.

4. **Phonon (Option A)**: Phonons are quantized vibrations of a crystal lattice. In a solid, the translational symmetry is explicitly broken by the periodic lattice structure in the Hamiltonian, not spontaneously broken. Since the symmetry breaking here is explicit rather than spontaneous, phonons are not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Thus, the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the phonon.
