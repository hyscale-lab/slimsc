Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of a complex. A higher β means the complex is more stable. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So, for Co(II) with thiocyanate (SCN-), the complexes probably form stepwise, adding more SCN- each time.

The complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2−n. So n=1,2,3,4? Wait, but wait, Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So the first complex, n=1: Co(SCN)²+ (charge +2-1=+1?), wait no, wait. Let me think. Co²+ plus one SCN- would be CoSCN²+ (because 2+ -1= +1 charge?), wait that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Co²+ plus SCN-.

Wait, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), because each SCN- is -1. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, neutral. n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- and n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the question mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- groups. So that's the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral.

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that the blue color might correspond to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, but I'm not entirely sure. But for the sake of the problem, I'll proceed under that assumption unless something else comes up.

The problem asks for the percentage of this [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex in the solution. So I need to calculate the fraction of all cobalt species that are in this form.

I think the approach is to consider all possible complexes and the free ion, then find the distribution based on the stability constants. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Stability constants usually increase with each step, but here β4 is lower than β3. Hmm. That might mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Could there be a mistake in the given βs? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. Wait, perhaps each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Wait, formation constants (β) are for each step. So β1 is K for Co²+ + SCN- → [CoSCN]^+; β2 is K for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

So the overall formation constant for the n=2 complex would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for n=3 it's β1*β2*β3, and for n=4, it's β1*β2*β3*β4.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the stability constant is given for the overall complex, not stepwise. But in this problem, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. So perhaps β1 is the overall β for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. So each β is the overall stability constant for that particular complex. So the β for n=1 is 9, n=2 is 40, n=3 is 63, and n=4 is 16.

So when calculating the fraction of each species, we need to consider all the possible complexes and the free ion.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

The approach is to model the distribution of Co species using the given stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN-.

I think the general approach is to consider all possible species and their equilibrium expressions. The total concentration of all Co species plus the free Co²+ should equal the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M.

Wait, but the solution includes a high concentration of SCN- (0.1 M), so the formation of complexes is favored. So most of the Co will be in complex forms, except maybe some free Co²+.

So the species present are:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [CoSCN]^+ (n=1, β1=9)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2, β2=40)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3, β3=63)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (n=4, β4=16)

Wait, but wait. If each β is the formation constant for the nth complex, then the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of all β's up to that n. For example, K1 = β1, K2 = β1*β2, K3=β1*β2*β3, K4=β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait no, because each β is the stepwise formation constant. So to get the overall K for each complex, you multiply the βs up to that level.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Formation constants can be given as stepwise (each β) or overall (the product up to that step). The problem states that the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps each β is for the overall complex. For example, β1 is the stability constant for [CoSCN]^+ relative to Co²+ and SCN-.

Wait, but that's not possible because for each complex, the overall stability constant would be β1 for [CoSCN]^+, β1*β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. Because the formation is stepwise.

So perhaps the given βs are the overall stability constants for each complex. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're the stepwise constants.

Hmm, let me think. The stability constant (β) for a complex is generally the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, the formation reaction is:

Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [CoSCN]^+

The stability constant β1 is K = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co²+][SCN-] )

Similarly, the second complex is formed by adding another SCN- to the first complex:

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0

The stability constant for this step is β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ [SCN-] )

So the overall stability constant for the second complex is β1 * β2.

Similarly, for the third complex:

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^−

β3 is the stepwise constant. The overall stability for [Co(SCN)_3]^− is β1 * β2 * β3.

And for the fourth complex:

[Co(SCN)_3]^− + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2−

with stepwise β4. So the overall K is β1*β2*β3*β4.

So in order to find the fraction of each species, we can model the system using the stepwise βs, and the total concentrations.

But this might get complicated because each complex can form from the previous one, and we have to consider all species.

Another approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The general formula for the fraction of each species is given by the product of the stepwise βs up to that species, divided by the sum of all such products plus 1 (for the free ion).

Wait, let me think. The fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) / (1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + ... + β1β2β3β4 )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of each species is [complex] divided by the total [Co], which is the sum of all species.

The total [Co] is [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co²+] and the product of the βs.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = β1 x S

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = (β1 * β2) * x * [SCN^-]^2 = β1 β2 x S²

[Co(SCN)_3]^− = (β1 β2 β3) x [SCN^-]^3 = β1 β2 β3 x S^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = (β1 β2 β3 β4) x [SCN^-]^4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4

So the total [Co] is x + β1 x S + β1 β2 x S² + β1 β2 β3 x S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4 = c = 0.01 M.

We can factor x out:

x (1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S² + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 ) = c.

So x = c / (1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S² + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 )

Once we have x, the concentration of each complex can be calculated, and the fraction for each complex is [complex]/c.

In this problem, we're interested in the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is (β1 β2 x S² ) / c.

So substituting x:

(β1 β2 S² * c ) / (1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S² + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 ) ) * (1/c) )

Wait, because x = c / denominator, so when you multiply β1 β2 S² x, you get β1 β2 S² * c / denominator.

So the fraction is (β1 β2 S²) / denominator.

Where denominator = 1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S² + β1 β2 β3 S³ + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4.

So S is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate each term in the denominator.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: β1 * S = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: β1 β2 S² = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 9*40 *0.01 = 360 *0.01 = 3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 S^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Let me compute that:

9 *40 = 360.

360 *63 = 22680.

(0.1)^3 = 0.001.

22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 = 9*40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute step by step:

9*40 = 360.

360 *63 = 22680.

22680 *16 = 362880.

(0.1)^4 = 0.0001.

362880 *0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, wait: 0.1^4 is 1e-4.

Wait, 22680 *16: let me compute 22680 *10=226800, 22680 *6=136080. Sum is 226800+136080=362880.

Then multiply by 0.0001: 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the terms are:

Term0: 1

Term1: 0.9

Term2: 3.6

Term3:22.68

Term4:36.288

Now sum all the terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 = 5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, the numerator for the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1 β2 S² = 3.6.

So the fraction is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ let's calculate that.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is 5.557%.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 3.6 /64.468 equals approximately 0.05557, which is about 5.56%. That's not matching any of the given options. The options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's way lower than any option. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is which. Because the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is our n=2 complex. But according to my calculation, its fraction is about 5.56%, which isn't any of the options, implying I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine the βs.

Wait, the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

But I assumed that each β is the stepwise formation constant. So for the n=2 complex, the overall β would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

Wait, no, because each β is the stepwise constant, so the total for n=2 is β1 * β2.

So in the denominator, the terms are:

Term0:1

Term1: β1 S =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2: β1 β2 S²=9*40*(0.1)^2= 3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 S^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3=9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute that:

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Adding all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is correct.

Then, the fraction for the n=2 complex is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557, about 5.56%, which is not an option.

But the options are all much higher. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the given βs are overall stability constants, not stepwise. That would change everything.

Let me think again. If β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, the formation would be:

For [CoSCN]^+ : K1 = β1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0: K2= β2=40.

But then, how would that affect the calculations? Because each K is for the entire complex, not stepwise.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Stability constants are generally for the overall complex. So the formation of [CoSCN]^+ would have β1=9.

The formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have β2=40, which would mean that the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 forms from Co²+ and two SCN- with K=40.

Wait, but that's not the usual way it works. The stepwise formation is more typical, but perhaps the given βs are the overall constants for each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are given for each complex, and the formation is considered as a single step. So for each complex order n, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the n-th complex from Co²+ and n SCN-.

In that case, the fraction of each species would be based on βn, and the denominator would be the sum of all βn [SCN]^n and 1, but that's not quite correct because the denominator would involve each βn multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, so in this case, the fraction of the n-th complex would be (βn [SCN]^n ) / (sum over m (βm [SCN]^m ) +1 )

Wait, but that's only for the case where each β is the overall stability constant for that complex. So, for example:

For [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n, the formation is Co²+ +n SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n.

The stability constant βn would be K = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n ] / ( [Co²+][SCN-]^n )

So if that's the case, then each complex's concentration is [Co²+] * βn [SCN]^n.

The total Co concentration is sum over n=0 to 4 ( [Co in species n] ) = sum [ [Co²+] * βn [SCN]^n ] + [Co²+] = [Co²+] ( sum βn [SCN]^n + 1 ) = c.

Thus, [Co²+] = c / ( sum βn [SCN]^n +1 )

And the fraction of each species is ( βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum βm [SCN]^m +1 )

So in this case, the denominator would be sum from n=0 to 4 (βn [SCN]^n ) +1, where β0=1 (for the free ion, n=0: Co²+).

Wait, but the given βs are for n=1,2,3,4; so β0=1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but wait, for n=4, the β is given as 16, which is lower than β3. That might imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which could be a problem. Because in reality, higher n complexes are generally more stable, but perhaps in this problem, it's possible.

So, in this scenario, the fraction of the n=2 complex (dithiocyanato) is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / denominator.

Let me compute each term:

Compute each βn [SCN]^n:

n=0: β0 [SCN]^0 =1*1=1.

n=1: β1 [SCN]^1=9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum these: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Denominator= sum +1? Wait no: the denominator is sum from n=0 to 4 of βn [SCN]^n = 2.3646.

Wait, no, wait. Because [Co²+] is 1 for n=0, so the denominator is the sum of all βn [SCN]^n. Because [Co²+] = c / (sum βn [SCN]^n +1 )? Wait, no, in the previous approach, the denominator is sum βn [SCN]^n plus 1. Wait, no, let me re-express:

The total Co is [Co²+] + sum ( [Co(SCN)_n] ) = [Co²+] + sum ( [Co²+ ] βn [SCN]^n ) = [Co²+ ] (1 + sum (βn [SCN]^n )) = c.

So [Co²+] = c / (1 + sum (βn [SCN]^n )).

Wait, but in this case, sum (βn [SCN]^n ) for n=1 to 4 is 0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=1.3646.

So 1 + 1.3646=2.3646.

Thus, [Co²+] = 0.01 M / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Now, the fraction of the n=2 complex is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + sum (βn [SCN]^n )).

So β2 [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

Denominator is 2.3646.

So fraction = 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Hmm, that matches. So that suggests that the correct answer is D) 16.9%.

Wait, but this approach depends on the assumption that the given βs are the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. So in this case, each βn is for the nth complex formed directly from Co²+ and n SCN-.

But earlier, when I considered the stepwise βs, the fraction was about 5.56%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the given βs are the overall constants, which makes the correct answer D.

So the answer must be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻. The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, which are interpreted as the overall stability constants for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, respectively.

### Key Equations and Approach
1. **Fraction of a Complex**: The fraction of a specific complex is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m + 1}
   \]
   Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) corresponds to the free Co²+ ion.

2. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of all terms \( \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \) for \( n = 0 \) to \( 4 \), where \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

3. **Numerator for [Co(SCN)_2]^0**: The numerator for the dithiocyanato complex is \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 \).

### Calculations
1. **Compute Each Term in the Denominator**:
   - \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \)
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

   Summing these terms:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. **Compute the Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:
   The numerator for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.4 \). Thus:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

3. **Convert to Percentage**:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
