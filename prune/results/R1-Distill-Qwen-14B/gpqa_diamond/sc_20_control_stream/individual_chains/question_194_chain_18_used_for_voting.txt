Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that there are three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? So I have to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-beta E) for all states.

But wait, each spin can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. For three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

Wait, but the energy expression involves the sum of their products. Let me think about how to compute E for each state.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the partition function without enumerating all 8 states. Because 8 isn't too bad, but perhaps I can find a symmetry or find a way to group states with the same energy.

Let me think: The energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Let me denote H = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. So E = -J H. So when I compute exp(-beta E) = exp(beta J H).

So the partition function Z = sum_{all states} exp(beta J H).

So I need to compute H for each state, group them, and sum the exponentials multiplied by the number of states with that H value.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the number of states where H equals a certain value, say h, and then compute sum (number of states with H=h) * exp(beta J h).

So I need to find all possible values of H and how many states give each H.

What are the possible values of H?

Each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, since each S is either +1 or -1. So S_i S_j is 1 if S_i = S_j, and -1 otherwise.

So H is the sum of three terms. So H can vary from -3 (if all three terms are -1) to +3 (if all three terms are +1).

But wait, can H actually reach 3? Let's see: For all three terms positive. That would require S1=S2, S1=S3, S2=S3. So all three spins are the same. So each of S1, S2, S3 is either +1 or -1. So two possibilities here: all + or all -. So H=3 in those cases.

Similarly, H can be 1, 0, -1, or -3? Or maybe other values? Hmm, maybe I should enumerate all possible H values and their counts.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to enumerate all possible states. But 8 is manageable. Let's see.

Each spin can be S=+1 or -1. Let's list all 8 possibilities.

But maybe another approach: For three spins, the number of states where all spins are the same is 2 (all +, all -). What about states where two are the same and one different?

Wait, but H is the sum of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think: the three terms are the products of each pair.

So for each state (s1, s2, s3), each term is s_i s_j.

So H = s1 s2 + s1 s3 + s2 s3.

Let me compute H for each possible state.

Case 1: All spins +1. s1=s2=s3=+1.

H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.

Case 2: Two spins +1, one spin -1.

Let me list all such possibilities.

Subcase 2a: s1=+1, s2=+1, s3=-1.

H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Subcase 2b: s1=+1, s2=-1, s3=+1.

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Subcase 2c: s1=-1, s2=+1, s3=+1.

H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

So all three subcases of two +1 and one -1 give H=-1.

How many such states are there? Each corresponds to a different position of the -1. So three states, each with H=-1.

Case 3: One spin +1, two spins -1.

Subcases:

Subcase3a: s1=+1, s2=-1, s3=-1.

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

Wait, same as Subcase2a? So H= -1.

Subcase3b: s1=-1, s2=+1, s3=-1.

H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Subcase3c: s1=-1, s2=-1, s3=+1.

H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

So all three subcases here also have H=-1.

Case4: All spins -1: s1=s2=s3=-1.

H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 3*1=3.

So, compiling the results:

- H=3: occurs in two states: all + and all -.

- H= -1: occurs in all other states, which are 6 in total.

Wait, because total states are 8. 2 with H=3, and 6 with H=-1.

So the partition function Z is sum of exp(beta J H) multiplied by the number of states for each H.

So Z = 2 * exp(beta J * 3) + 6 * exp(beta J * (-1)).

Wait, because for each H, you multiply the number of states with that H by the exponential term.

Wait, but wait—what's the correct expression? The energy is E = -J H. So when H is 3, E is -J*3. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E) = exp(beta J H).

So for H=3, each of the two states contributes exp(beta J *3). For H=-1, each of the six states contributes exp(beta J * (-1)).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).

Wait, but let me double-check: I have 2 states with H=3 and 6 with H=-1.

So Z = 2 e^{3 beta J} + 6 e^{- beta J}.

Looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, the options are:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{J β}

Option B: 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β}

Option C: 2 e^{2 J β} +6 e^{-2 J β}

Option D: 6 e^{2 J β} +2 e^{-2 J β}

So according to my calculation, the correct Z is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-J β}, which is option B.

But wait, wait. Let me check again the calculation of H for the two-spin and one-spin cases. Because I'm a bit confused about whether all those states give H=-1.

Let me pick another state: for example, s1=+1, s2=-1, s3=+1.

H would be S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. So H = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. Yes, correct.

Another state: s1=+1, s2=+1, s3=-1.

H = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Another state: s1=-1, s2=-1, s3=+1.

H = (1) + (-1) + (-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Yes, all these cases do indeed give H=-1. So the earlier analysis is correct.

Thus, the partition function is 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{- β J}, which is option B.

To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E),
\]

where \( \beta = 1 / kT \). Substituting \( E = -J H \) (with \( H = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \)), the partition function becomes:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(\beta J H).
\]

### Step 1: Possible values of \( H \)
Each term \( S_i S_j \) can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). Therefore, \( H \) is the sum of three such terms, and its possible values are:

- \( H = 3 \): All three terms are \( +1 \), which occurs when all spins are the same (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).
- \( H = -1 \): Two terms are \( -1 \) and one term is \( +1 \), which occurs when two spins are the same and one is different.

### Step 2: Counting states for each \( H \)
- For \( H = 3 \): There are 2 states (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).
- For \( H = -1 \): There are 6 states, corresponding to the three possible positions of the single spin that differs from the other two.

### Step 3: Partition function calculation
The partition function is:

\[
Z = 2 \cdot \exp(3 \beta J) + 6 \cdot \exp(-\beta J).
\]

### Step 4: Matching with options
From the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 e^{-3J\beta} + 6 e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 e^{2J\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 e^{2J\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
