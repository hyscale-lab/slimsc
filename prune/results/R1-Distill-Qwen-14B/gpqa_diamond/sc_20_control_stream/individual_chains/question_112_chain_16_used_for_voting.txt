Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a shot.

The problem says that the electron is in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, meaning their probabilities add up to 1. But wait, the question says it's proportional, so I probably need to normalize it first before calculating probabilities.

The question then asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij such that A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, what does that look like for a 2x2 matrix?

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the operator would have elements:
A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Because when i != j, it's hbar/2, else 0. Oh wait, no, that's the off-diagonal elements. So this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2, right? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) * X.

Wait, but the eigenstates of the Pauli X operator are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. Oh, but wait, the operator in the problem is different. Because in the problem, A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So yes, that's the same as (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So its eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states in the x-direction, right? So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and then find the square of the coefficients as probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator is represented by A, which is (hbar/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |-x>. So the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, respectively.

But wait, wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/√2, right? So to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of these.

But first, let's write down |alpha> explicitly. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I need to normalize this state.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b=(2 -i). The normalization is the square of the magnitude of a and b. So the norm is |a|² + |b|².

Compute |a|²: |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |b|²: |2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Expressed as:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

Where c1 and c2 are coefficients to find.

So, substituting |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So,

|alpha> = [ (|up> + |down>)/√2 ] * c1 + [ (|up> - |down>)/√2 ] * c2.

Grouping terms:

= [ (c1 + c2)/√2 ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/√2 ] |down>.

Compare this with the expression for |alpha>:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

(c1 + c2)/√2 = (1+i)/sqrt(7)  --> Equation 1

(c1 - c2)/√2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) --> Equation 2

Now we have two equations. Let's solve for c1 and c2.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but maybe it's easier to solve them directly.

Let me write equation 1 as c1 + c2 = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7) = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Similarly, equation 2: c1 - c2 = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Now, adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding equation 1 and equation 2:

2c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify: (1+i +2 -i ) = 3. So,

2c1 = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) => c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7)

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify: (1+i -2 +i )= (-1 +2i )

So,

2c2 = (-1 +2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

c2 = (-1 +2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

But perhaps I should compute |c1|² and |c2|² because the probabilities are the square of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Alternatively, since the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, the probability of measuring each eigenstate is the square of the amplitude of |alpha> in each eigenstate.

So, the probability P(+x) = |< +x | alpha > |^2, and P(-x) = |< -x | alpha > |^2.

So let's compute these:

First, compute <+x | alpha>.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2.

So,

<+x | alpha> = (1/√2) ( <up| + <down| ) [ (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down> ]

= (1/√2)( (1+i)/√7 * <up|up> + (2 -i)/√7 * <down|up> + (1+i)/√7 * <up|down> + (2 -i)/√7 <down|down> )

But <up|down> is zero, so:

= (1/√2)( (1+i)/√7 + (2 -i)/√7 )

= [ ( (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] / (√2 * √7 )

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 + i -i = 3.

So,

= 3 / (√2 * √7 ) = 3 / sqrt(14 )

So | <+x | alpha> |^2 = (3)^2 / (14 ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. Let me check the options. Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857..., which is about 0.643, so rounds to 0.64, which matches option A's first value.

But wait, wait, the probabilities should add to 1. So, if P(+x) is 9/14, then P(-x) is 5/14, since 9+5=14.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is about 0.36. So this would fit option A, which says 0.64 and 0.36.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, <+x | alpha> is [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = (3) / sqrt(14).

So the square is 9/14, which is approximately 0.642857, so 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

Hmm, so the probability of measuring |+x> is 9/14, which is approximately 0.64, and the other eigenstate is 5/14 ≈ 0.36.

So that would match option A for the probabilities.

Now, the next part is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value is given by <alpha| A | alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, its average can be found using the expectation value formula.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, but wait, no: the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by a factor, the eigenvalues scale accordingly.

Wait, no, A_ij is zero on the diagonal, hbar/2 elsewhere. So A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So A = (h bar / 2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But another approach: since A is diagonal in the x-basis, the expectation value can be found using the probabilities. Because in the x-basis, A has eigenvalues + (hbar/2) and -(hbar/2).

Wait, no. Wait, the operator A is represented as (hbar/2) * σ_x, so its eigenvalues are (hbar/2) * ±1.

So the average value is (hbar/2) * [ P(+x) * (+1) + P(-x) * (-1) ) ]

Hmm, but wait, actually, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x for the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

So let's compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

First, write |alpha> as ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So,

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * ( |down> + |up> ) / sqrt(7).

Because σ_x | up> = |down>, and similarly σ_x |down> = |up>.

So,

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ ( (1 - i)/sqrt(7) ) <up| + ( (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) <down| ] * (hbar/2) ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(7) )

Multiply it out:

= (hbar/2) * [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (1)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (1)/sqrt(7) + (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, let me clarify. Let me write it as:

= (hbar/2) * [ ( (1 -i) * 1 + (2 + i) * 1 ) / (7) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have <up| + <down| multiplied by (|up> + |down> ), each term contributes as follows:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ (1 -i) * 1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) + (1 -i) *1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) + (2 + i) *1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) + (2 +i) *1/sqrt(7)*1/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

The calculation is:

( ( (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ) / sqrt(7) ) * ( (hbar/2) ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(7) )

So,

= (hbar/2) * [ (1 - i)(1) + (1 - i)(0) + (2 +i)(0) + (2 +i)(1) ) ] / (7)

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each term:

Term 1: (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2) * 1/sqrt(7) = (1 - i) (hbar/2) /7

Term 2: (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2) * 1/sqrt(7) = same as term 1

Term 3: (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2) * 1/sqrt(7) = (2 +i) (hbar/2) /7

Term 4: (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2) * 1/sqrt(7) = same as term 3

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The expectation value is:

= (hbar/2) * [ (1 - i)(1) + (2 + i)(1) ) ] / (7)

Because <up|up> is 1, <up|down> is 0, <down|up> is 0, <down|down> is 1.

Wait, no, more precisely:

The product ( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * (hbar/2) * (1/sqrt(7)) ) for |up> terms.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me compute it as:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i)† * A (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i) ) for |up> component, plus similar for |down>.

Wait, no, I'm mixing up the terms. Let me approach this correctly.

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

So,

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ |down> + |up> ] / sqrt(7 )

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 -i ) <up| + (2 +i ) <down| ] / sqrt(7) ) * (hbar/2) ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(7 )

Multiply the terms:

= (hbar/2) * [ (1 -i)(1) + (1 -i)(0) + (2 +i)(0) + (2 +i)(1) ) ] / (7)

Wait, no, more accurately, the inner product is:

(1 -i) * 1 + (2 +i) * 1, all divided by 7, multiplied by hbar/2.

Because:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|down> and <down|up> are zero, so the terms reduce to:

= (hbar/2) * [ (1 - i)(1) + (2 +i)(1) ] / (7 )

So the numerator is (1 -i + 2 +i ) = 3.

So,

= (hbar/2) * 3 /7 = (3 hbar) / (14 )

Which is approximately 0.214 hbar.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the average is hbar /7, which is approximately 0.1428 hbar. Hmm, but according to this calculation, the average is 3 hbar /14, which is approximately 0.214 hbar.

Wait, so where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me try another approach. The operator A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2.

So, the matrix form of A is:

A = (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Expressed as a column vector, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, A |alpha> is (hbar/2) times [ [0,1],[1,0] ] multiplied by |alpha> vector.

So, matrix multiplication gives:

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ |down> * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + |up> * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (hbar/2) * [ (2 - i) |up> + (1 +i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2 )

Wait, because:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (1 -i) * (2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / 7

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

Since i² = -1, this becomes 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i².

Again, i²=-1: 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i ) = 2.

So the total is (hbar/2) * 2 /7 = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar /7.

Ah, that's different from my earlier calculation. So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, so earlier I thought it came out to 3hbar/14, but now it's hbar/7. So I must have messed up the first method.

So in the first approach, when I considered the expectation value as (hbar/2)(P(+x) - P(-x)), perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, let me re-do that approach.

The expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x for the state |alpha>.

The expectation value of σ_x is given by <+x| sigma_x |alpha> - < -x | sigma_x |alpha> ?

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value of σ_x is given by summing the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues. Since σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for the eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value is P(+x)*1 + P(-x)*(-1) = P(+x) - P(-x).

So, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * [ P(+x) - P(-x) ]

In our case, P(+x) is 9/14, P(-x) is 5/14.

So,

= (hbar/2) * (9/14 -5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches the second method's result.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36.

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → which matches.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis
To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), expand \( |\alpha\rangle \) in this basis:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
c_1 = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_2 = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):
\[
P(+x) = |c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the fact that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) for \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = P(+x) - P(-x) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).
