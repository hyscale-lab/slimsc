Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits, and they were found using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I don't think that matters for this particular question. What's important is that they are in orbital resonance, and their periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods of Planet_1 through Planet_5 are in that ratio.

The question is asking about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Oh, and they all have the same albedo. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedo is the same for all, that part cancels out.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ d²) )^(1/4) ). Wait, alternatively, the more common formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and T_eff is the star's effective temperature. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Oh right, the formula is T = T_star * ( L / (16πσ d²) )^(1/4) ). But another way to think about it is that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( L / (d²) )^(1/4). Since all the planets orbit the same star, L and σ are constants, so the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance squared, which simplifies to 1 over the distance. Wait, let me make sure.

The equilibrium temperature equation is often written as Te = ( (L / (16πσ d²)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedo is the same for all, it cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of temperatures depends on the ratio of (1/d)^(1/2). Wait no, because when you take the ratio, (d2/d1) would be (a2/a1) in terms of their semi-major axes.

Wait, no. Let's get this right. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So, T ∝ 1/√a. Because if you have a planet at distance a, the flux it receives is L/(4πa²), which is the inverse square law. The planet's equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance: incoming flux equals outgoing. So the formula is T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4). So, when A is the same, the temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/√a.

So the ratio of temperatures Te4/Te2 would be sqrt(a2/a4). Because Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so when you take Te4/Te2, it's (sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4)) = sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me think of each planet's period. The planets are in an orbital resonance, so their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, their periods are P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. So, P2 is 2*P1. P3 is 2.5*P1, etc.

But Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So, P^2 ∝ a^3. So, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, the semi-major axes of the planets are in the ratio P1^(2/3) : (2 P1)^(2/3) : (2.5 P1)^(2/3) : (3.5 P1)^(2/3) : (5 P1)^(2/3). Which simplifies to 1 : 2^(2/3) : 2.5^(2/3) : 3.5^(2/3) : 5^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute the a for each planet in terms of P1's a. Let's denote a1 as the semi-major axis of Planet_1, then a2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) * a1. Since P2 is 2 P1, a2 = 2^(2/3) a1. Similarly, a3 = (2.5)^(2/3) a1, a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) a1, a5 = (5)^(2/3) a1.

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

3.5 is 7/2. So, 3.5/2 = (7/2)/2 = 7/4 = 1.75.

So, a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4) )^(2/3).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me double-check: a4 is (3.5 P1)^(2/3)*a1, a2 is (2 P1)^(2/3)*a1. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

So, (3.5/2) = 1.75. So, (1.75)^(2/3).

What's 1.75? It's 7/4. So, (7/4)^(2/3).

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (7/4)^(2/3), so the ratio of distances is that.

But the temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So,

Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (2)^(2/3) / (3.5)^(2/3) ) ) ?

Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, a4 is (3.5)^(2/3) * a1, a2 is (2)^(2/3) * a1. So, a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3). Wait, because 2/3.5 equals 4/7.

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) is 4/7. So, (2/3.5) = (4/7).

So, a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

So, sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3).

So, (4/7)^(1/3) is the same as (4^(1/3))/(7^(1/3)).

Compute that. Let me think of 4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874. 7^(1/3) is about 1.913.

So, 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83. Hmm.

Wait, so Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio of their temperatures is about 0.83, so Planet_4 is cooler than Planet_2 by about 0.83 times.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, and option D is 0.75. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I mix up the exponents.

Another approach: the distance ratio a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). So, 3.5 is 7/2. So 7/2 divided by 2 gives (7/4) for the ratio. So, a4/a2 = (7/4)^(2/3).

Wait, no, a4 is (3.5)^(2/3)*a1, a2 is (2)^(2/3)*a1. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3). So, (a4/a2) is (7/4)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio is Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (2/3.5) )^(2/3) )^(1/2) )? Wait, maybe another way.

Wait, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, Te4 = k / sqrt(a4), Te2 = k / sqrt(a2). So, Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2/a4 ).

a2/a4 = (2^(2/3)) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Which is the same as what I did before. So, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is around 0.83.

Wait, wait, let me compute cube root of 0.5714. I know that 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.83^3 is approximately 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 gives about 0.571. Yes, that's right. So, 0.83 cubed is approximately 0.571, which is 4/7 (~0.5714). So, cube root of 4/7 is about 0.83.

So, Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio of the temperatures is about 0.83. So, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is about 83% that of Planet_2.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So, the correct answer would be C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \)), the semi-major axes are proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the semi-major axes of the planets are in the ratio \( 1:2^{2/3}:2.5^{2/3}:3.5^{2/3}:5^{2/3} \).

For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their semi-major axes are proportional to \( 2^{2/3} \) and \( 3.5^{2/3} \), respectively. The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \), the cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is about \( 0.83 \).

Among the given options:

- **A) ~0.57**: Too low.
- **B) ~0.69**: Too low.
- **C) ~0.83**: Correct.
- **D) ~0.75**: Slightly lower than the calculated value.

The correct answer is **C**, as the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 83% that of Planet_2.

Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits, and they were found using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I don't think that matters for this particular question. What's important is that they are in orbital resonance, and their periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods of Planet_1 through Planet_5 are in that ratio.

The question is asking about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Oh, and they all have the same albedo. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedo is the same for all, that part cancels out.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ d²) )^(1/4) ). Wait, alternatively, the more common formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and T_eff is the star's effective temperature. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Oh right, the formula is T = T_star * ( L / (16πσ d²) )^(1/4) ). But another way to think about it is that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( L / (d²) )^(1/4). Since all the planets orbit the same star, L and σ are constants, so the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance squared, which simplifies to 1 over the distance. Wait, let me make sure.

The equilibrium temperature equation is often written as Te = ( (L / (16πσ d²)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedo is the same for all, it cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of temperatures depends on the ratio of (1/d)^(1/2). Wait no, because when you take the ratio, (d2/d1) would be (a2/a1) in terms of their semi-major axes.

Wait, no. Let's get this right. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So, T ∝ 1/√a. Because if you have a planet at distance a, the flux it receives is L/(4πa²), which is the inverse square law. The planet's equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance: incoming flux equals outgoing. So the formula is T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4). So, when A is the same, the temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/√a.

So the ratio of temperatures Te4/Te2 would be sqrt(a2/a4). Because Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so when you take Te4/Te2, it's (sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4)) = sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me think of each planet's period. The planets are in an orbital resonance, so their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, their periods are P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. So, P2 is 2*P1. P3 is 2.5*P1, etc.

But Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So, P^2 ∝ a^3. So, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, the semi-major axes of the planets are in the ratio P1^(2/3) : (2 P1)^(2/3) : (2.5 P1)^(2/3) : (3.5 P1)^(2/3) : (5 P1)^(2/3). Which simplifies to 1 : 2^(2/3) : 2.5^(2/3) : 3.5^(2/3) : 5^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute the a for each planet in terms of P1's a. Let's denote a1 as the semi-major axis of Planet_1, then a2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) * a1. Since P2 is 2 P1, a2 = 2^(2/3) a1. Similarly, a3 = (2.5)^(2/3) a1, a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) a1, a5 = (5)^(2/3) a1.

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

3.5 is 7/2. So, 3.5/2 = (7/2)/2 = 7/4 = 1.75.

So, a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4) )^(2/3).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me double-check: a4 is (3.5 P1)^(2/3)*a1, a2 is (2 P1)^(2/3)*a1. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

So, (3.5/2) = 1.75. So, (1.75)^(2/3).

What's 1.75? It's 7/4. So, (7/4)^(2/3).

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (7/4)^(2/3), so the ratio of distances is that.

But the temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So,

Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (2)^(2/3) / (3.5)^(2/3) ) ) ?

Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, a4 is (3.5)^(2/3) * a1, a2 is (2)^(2/3) * a1. So, a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3). Wait, because 2/3.5 equals 4/7.

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) is 4/7. So, (2/3.5) = (4/7).

So, a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

So, sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3).

So, (4/7)^(1/3) is the same as (4^(1/3))/(7^(1/3)).

Compute that. Let me think of 4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874. 7^(1/3) is about 1.913.

So, 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83. Hmm.

Wait, so Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio of their temperatures is about 0.83, so Planet_4 is cooler than Planet_2 by about 0.83 times.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, and option D is 0.75. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I mix up the exponents.

Another approach: the distance ratio a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). So, 3.5 is 7/2. So 7/2 divided by 2 gives (7/4) for the ratio. So, a4/a2 = (7/4)^(2/3).

Wait, no, a4 is (3.5)^(2/3)*a1, a2 is (2)^(2/3)*a1. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3). So, (a4/a2) is (7/4)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio is Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (2/3.5) )^(2/3) )^(1/2) )? Wait, maybe another way.

Wait, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, Te4 = k / sqrt(a4), Te2 = k / sqrt(a2). So, Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2/a4 ).

a2/a4 = (2^(2/3)) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Which is the same as what I did before. So, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is around 0.83.

Wait, wait, let me compute cube root of 0.5714. I know that 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.83^3 is approximately 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 gives about 0.571. Yes, that's right. So, 0.83 cubed is approximately 0.571, which is 4/7 (~0.5714). So, cube root of 4/7 is about 0.83.

So, Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio of the temperatures is about 0.83. So, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is about 83% that of Planet_2.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So, the correct answer would be C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \)), the semi-major axes are proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the semi-major axes of the planets are in the ratio \( 1:2^{2/3}:2.5^{2/3}:3.5^{2/3}:5^{2/3} \).

For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their semi-major axes are proportional to \( 2^{2/3} \) and \( 3.5^{2/3} \), respectively. The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \), the cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is about \( 0.83 \).

Among the given options:

- **A) ~0.57**: Too low.
- **B) ~0.69**: Too low.
- **C) ~0.83**: Correct.
- **D) ~0.75**: Slightly lower than the calculated value.

The correct answer is **C**, as the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 83% that of Planet_2.

Answer: C
