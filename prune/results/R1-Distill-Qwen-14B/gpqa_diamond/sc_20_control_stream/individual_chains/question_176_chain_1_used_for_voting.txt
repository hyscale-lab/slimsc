Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look normalized because the components are -1, 2, 1. Oh right, the state vector needs to be a unit vector, so I'll have to normalize it first.

So the state vector is ψ = [-1; 2; 1]. Let's calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Next, the problem talks about two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as matrices. So operator P's matrix has the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Operator Q's matrix is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1.

The question is, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q. Hmm, wait, but the order is important. Oh wait, the question says "measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the process is: first measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state after P was measured.

Wait, no, wait. No, when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then Q is measured on that new state. So we need to find the probabilities of both events happening: first getting 0 for P, then getting -1 for Q in that new state.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurements are done in sequence. So first measure P, then Q on the state resulting from P's measurement.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to find the possible outcomes when measuring P, and their corresponding probabilities. Then, for each eigenvalue of P, if the outcome is 0, the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. Then, in that state, measure Q to find the probability of getting -1.

So let's start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

To find eigenvalues, we need to solve det(P - λI) = 0.

So the matrix P - λI is:

[
[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]
]

Calculating the determinant:

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found by expansion. Let's expand along the first row.

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2))] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] + 0 * something.

Wait, let me compute this step by step. The determinant is:

-λ * [ determinant of minor matrix when row 1, column 1 is removed ]

The minor after row 1, column 1 is the 2x2 matrix:

[
[-λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ]
]

The determinant of this minor is (λ^2) - (1/2).

Then, the next term is - (1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by the minor from row 1 column 2. The minor is:

[
[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, -λ]
]

Wait no, when expanding along the first row, the signs alternate as +, -, +. So the determinant would be:

-λ * [ (λ^2 - 1/2) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using another method. Alternatively, perhaps looking for symmetry or possible eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P has some symmetric properties. Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Looking for possible patterns, perhaps the eigenvalues include 0, since the matrix P seems to have some structure that might allow a zero eigenvalue.

Alternatively, let's compute the determinant more carefully.

The determinant of P - λI is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))(-λ) - (0) ) ] 
+ 0 [ ... ]

So:

= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) 
+ 0.

Wait, the minor for the second term is:

When we remove row 1 and column 2, the minor is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So it's:

[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, -λ]

The determinant of this is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ/(sqrt(2)).

So the second term is -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/(sqrt(2))) ) = -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ -λ/(sqrt(2)) ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) = λ/(2).

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Because the expansion is:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2)) * (determinant of minor) ) + 0.

Wait, the determinant is calculated as:

(-λ) * (λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (0) ) ] + 0.

So that's:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) )

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/(2)) )

Because (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) is 1/2.

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2)

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ)/(2)

So the determinant is:

(-λ^3 + λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

Setting this equal to zero:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ = 0, or λ² =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but let me double-check the determinant calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by another approach, like looking for eigenvectors.

Let's consider possible eigenvectors.

Looking at the structure of P:

The matrix is:

Row 1: 0, a, 0 (a=1/sqrt(2))
Row 2: a, 0, a
Row 3: 0, a, 0

So perhaps a symmetric structure. Let's see if there's an eigenvector where all components are the same.

Let v = [1, 1, 1]^T.

Pv = [0*1 + a*1 +0*1; a*1 +0*1 +a*1; 0*1 +a*1 +0*1 ] = [a, 2a, a].

Which is a times [1, 2, 1], so unless [1,2,1] is a multiple of v, which it isn't, because v is [1,1,1], which is not same as [1,2,1]. So that might not be an eigenvector.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Let me think about the trace of P. The trace is 0 + 0 +0 =0. The sum of eigenvalues is 0, which matches our calculation (0 +1 + (-1) )=0. So that seems consistent.

Another way is to look for eigenvectors. Let's suppose λ=0 is an eigenvalue.

We can solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v =0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) =0 → v1 = -v3.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation; v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let v1 =1, v3= -1. So eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T, or any scalar multiple.

But wait, perhaps we can normalize it. The vector (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1 +0 +1)=sqrt(2). So normalized, it would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but wait: let's compute Pv for this vector.

v = [1, 0, -1]^T.

Pv is:

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1 -1)/sqrt(2) )=0.

Row3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

So yes, P v=0. So λ=0 is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T (or any scalar multiple).

Now, for λ=1.

We need to solve (P - I) v =0.

P - I is:

[-1, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -1, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -1]
]

So the equations are:

- v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 - v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Third equation: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 - v3 =0 → v3 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Let me express v1 and v3 in terms of v2.

v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

v3 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Substituting into second equation:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2) v2 ) =0.

Let's compute each term:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2) v2) = (1/2) v2.

Similarly, the third term is (1/2) v2.

So the equation becomes:

(1/2 v2) - v2 + (1/2 v2) ) =0.

Adding them: (1/2 + (-1) +1/2 ) v2 = ( (1/2 +1/2) -1 ) v2 = (1 -1) v2=0. So 0=0, which is always true.

So the system is underdetermined, with v2 as a free variable.

Let's choose v2=1. Then v1 = 1/sqrt(2), v3=1/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Let me check normalization: (1/sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= 2. So the length is sqrt(2). So to normalize, divide by sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ] → [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].

Wait, no. Wait, original vector is [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)].

The length is sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )=sqrt( 2 ) → so normalize by dividing by sqrt(2).

So normalized eigenvector is [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2) ].

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 1/sqrt(2) divided by sqrt(2) is (1/sqrt(2))/sqrt(2) )= 1/(2).

Similarly for the third component.

So the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].

Wait, but let me actually compute it:

Each component of the eigenvector is:

v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) / sqrt(2) ) = 1/(2).

v2 = 1 / sqrt(2).

v3 = 1/(2).

So yes, the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but let me double-check the normalization:

(1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) )= (1/4 +1/4) = 1/2 +1/2=1. So yes, correct.

Similarly, for λ=-1, perhaps the eigenvector is symmetric. Let's see.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me proceed.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1. So possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the initial state is ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ] → normalized to 1/sqrt(6) times that.

So ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then measuring Q gives -1.

So first, when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, which has a non-zero overlap with the initial state.

So the probability of getting 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the initial state and the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 is u0 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the inner product between ψ and u0 is:

ψ · u0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1 * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + 2*0 + 1 * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-2/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting 0 in P is 1/3.

Wait, but wait: the inner product can't be negative? Well, the inner product is a complex number, but the probability is the modulus squared. So yes, the probability is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenstate u0. Now, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting -1.

What's the operator Q again? Oh, it's diagonal: Q = diag(1, 0, -1).

So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, with eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors.

So the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1 is e3 = [0,0,1]^T.

So the probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between u0 and e3.

Wait, but u0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the inner product u0 · e3 is the third component of u0, which is -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is ( |-1/sqrt(2)| )^2 = (1/2).

So the combined probability is the probability of getting P=0, multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P=0.

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

When you measure P and get 0, the state becomes u0. Now, measuring Q in this state: the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1, 0, -1.

The probability of getting -1 is |<e3 | u0>|^2.

Which is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

So yes, the probability is 1/2.

Thus, the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1/6. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the steps.

First, the initial state is normalized, correct?

Yes, the state was [-1,2,1], which has norm sqrt(6), so normalized to 1/sqrt(6) times that.

Eigenvalues of P are 0,1,-1. Correct, as per determinant calculation.

Eigenstate for 0 is [1,0,-1]^T normalized, which is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Inner product between ψ and u0 is (-1/sqrt(2) ) + (0) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) multiplied by 1/sqrt(6) → which gives (-2/sqrt(2)) * 1/sqrt(6) → (-2)/(sqrt(12)) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

Probability is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3. Correct.

Then, when we measure Q in the state u0, the probability of -1 is the square of the amplitude in e3, which is (-1/sqrt(2)).

Amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), so probability is (1/2).

So 1/3 * 1/2 is 1/6. So option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The state of the system is given as a column vector \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues of \( P \), the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \) is solved. The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \( \lambda = 0 \): \( u_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \),
- For \( \lambda = 1 \): \( u_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \),
- For \( \lambda = -1 \): \( u_{-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -\sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is determined by the overlap between \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) and \( u_0 \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle u_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( u_0 \). The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors \( e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( e_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( e_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively. The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) in the state \( u_0 \) is determined by the overlap between \( u_0 \) and \( e_3 \):

\[
\langle e_3 | u_0 \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
