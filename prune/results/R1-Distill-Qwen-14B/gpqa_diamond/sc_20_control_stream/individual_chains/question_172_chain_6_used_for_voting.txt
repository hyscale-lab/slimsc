Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere, it's all about the Boltzmann equation and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Right, LTE means that each small part of the photosphere is in equilibrium, so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I should relate this to the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of particles in the two energy levels, g is the statistical weight, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Since the problem is about the ratio of excitation, let's assume the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars because it's talking about the same transition in iron. So, the ratio simplifies to (n_i/n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference.

Wait, wait. The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, n_1 for star_1 is twice n_2 for star_2. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. It says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited (meaning n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2 in the specific level). So, n1 = 2 n2. Or, more accurately, the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star_1, the ratio is n1/nj = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's n2/nj = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). Wait, no, I think I need to model it correctly. Let's clarify.

Assuming that the ground state is level j and the excited state is i, then n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j. Since ΔE is given as positive (E_i > E_j), and the exponent is negative, higher temperatures would lead to a higher ratio of excited to ground state.

Wait, in star_1, the excitation is higher. So, n1_i (number in excited level) is twice n2_i? Wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, if the energy level in question is the excited state, then n1 (excited) is twice n2 (excited). Or is it the ratio when compared to the same level in each star?

Hmm, maybe I should model the ratio for each star. For star_1, the ratio of excited to ground in level i is (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2, (n_i^2)/(n_j^2) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So, (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = 2 * (n_i^2)/(n_j^2). Wait, is that correct? Or is it (n_i^1)/(n_i^2) = 2? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, comparing the same energy level in each star. So, maybe the ratio within each star is the same, but the question says star_1 has twice as many in that level compared to star_2. So, n1_i = 2 * n2_i. But wait, no, because the other levels (like the ground state) could also be different. So perhaps we should take the ratio of the same energy level in each star.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. Hmm, that's probably a better approach.

Let me think again. The excitation level is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in a lower state. So, the excitation is higher when the ratio is larger.

So, for star_1, (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2, (n_i^2)/(n_j^2) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = 2 * (n_i^2)/(n_j^2).

So, substituting:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, wait. Let me compute [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, putting that in:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, the question is about the equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. So, let's write it as:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) )

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the value of ΔE or k, but it says to assume that the photosphere is in LTE. So, the correct equation would involve the temperatures. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

But wait, where is the ΔE/(k) factor? Because in the equation I derived, it's multiplied by (ΔE/(k)).

Hmm. So, the given options don't include any terms with ΔE or k. So, perhaps the problem assumes that the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars because it's the same transition.

Wait, but the equation I have is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But I don't have any information about ΔE or k, so perhaps the problem expects that ΔE/(k) is a constant, but that's unclear.

Wait, the problem says to find the equation for T_1 and T_2. So perhaps the equation we're looking for is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (1/(T2)) - (1/(T1)) )

Wait, wait, let me re-express:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

So, the equation is ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But in that equation, the factor ΔE/(k) is missing. So, none of the options match that. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, that number is the same as k (Boltzmann's constant) which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So, ΔE = k * something. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K). So, ΔE/(k) = (k * something) / k = something. Wait, wait, no: ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k * T * x, but wait, ΔE/(k) = T * x. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the given ΔE is equal to k multiplied by some temperature difference? Or another way, maybe ΔE/(k) is a certain value. Let's compute it.

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T * something. Let me compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. Wait, that can't be, because 1.38e-23 J is k. So, yes, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So, ΔE = k * T_diff, where T_diff is 1 K? Because ΔE/(k) = 1, so ΔE = k * 1 = k.

Wait, but ΔE is the energy difference between two levels, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. Since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE = k * 1 K. So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Wait, that's a key point. So, substituting back into the equation, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, we get:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches exactly.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels is used, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which is equal to Boltzmann's constant (k).

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of excited to ground state atoms is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_i^1}{n_j^1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_i^2}{n_j^2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_i^1}{n_j^1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_i^2}{n_j^2}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring the temperature terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Given that ΔE = k (since ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J and k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A does not account for the temperature ratio correctly.
- Option B introduces an incorrect combination of temperatures.
- Option C incorrectly includes a squared term in the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
