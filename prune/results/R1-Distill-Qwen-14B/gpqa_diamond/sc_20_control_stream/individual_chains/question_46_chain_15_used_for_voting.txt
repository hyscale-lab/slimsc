Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So it's like swapping the ends of the alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Let me draw the structure. Pent means five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Because pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, I think. Oh wait, no, actually, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But in this case, it's 3-methyl, so on carbon 3, which is the third carbon from the double bond. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 and C5 are CH2 and CH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst induces metathesis. So when you have an alkene treated with a Grubbs catalyst, it can undergo ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening, but more commonly, it's ring-closing when a diene is present. Wait, but in this case, we have a mono-ene. Oh, wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong scenario.

Alternatively, wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis which can include breaking a double bond and reforming it. So 3-methylpent-1-ene, when treated with Grubbs, could undergo a ring-closing metathesis if possible, but but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mono-ene, so maybe it's not going to form a ring. Or maybe it can undergo some other kind of metathesis.

Wait, another thought: metathesis can involve the breaking of the double bond into two fragments and swapping the ends. So for a molecule like CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, when Grubbs is applied, the double bond breaks, and the two ends (the two CH₂ groups) swap. So the two ends would be CH₂ and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the possible products would be the different ways these can recombine.

Wait, but wait. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for olefin metathesis. The reaction can proceed via a mechanism where the catalyst binds to the alkene, breaking the double bond and forming metal-alkylidene complexes. Then, these complexes can exchange their alkylidene groups, leading to the formation of new alkenes.

So in the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

When it undergoes metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond, and the two parts (CH₂ and the rest) can swap partners. So the possible products would be from combining the different ends.

Wait, but wait. If the original is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, breaking the double bond would give two parts: CH₂– and –CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Then, the catalyst would facilitate swapping, allowing the ends to pair in different ways.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the molecule would form a ring if possible. But in this case, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Wait, I think I might have messed up the structure. Let me correct that.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So when Grubbs is applied, the double bond breaks, and the two ends can swap. So the possible products would be all the possible alkenes that can form from the metathesis.

Wait, but sometimes in metathesis, you can get different alkenes based on where the breaks occur. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring-closing if the chain is long enough. Let me check the carbon chain length. Pent means five carbons, so the chain is five carbons long, but with a substituent.

Wait, so the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH₃. So, the chain is five carbons, with a methyl on the third carbon.

When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bond and then recombine the ends in different ways. So the two ends are CH₂– and –CH(CH3)CH₂CH3.

Wait, but when the double bond breaks, each end becomes a metal carbene, which can exchange partners. So the possible products would be the different alkenes formed from the possible combinations.

Wait, so for a molecule like CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, the possible products would be:

If the two CH₂ groups are swapped, maybe?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Another approach: when Grubbs is used on an alkene, what happens? It can either break the alkene into two fragments and swap them, leading to a new alkene, or if the molecule can form a ring, it might form a cyclic product.

Wait, but for this molecule, if it undergoes ring-closing, how long a ring would that be? The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the other end is C5. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So from C1 to C5 would be four bonds away. Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the chain is five carbons, so the distance between the two ends is three carbons apart. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic structure. So the number of possible products would depend on how many different rings can form, and whether there are any other products.

Wait, but if the molecule is treated with Grubbs, which is a first-generation catalyst, it's more likely to perform ring-closing metathesis if the molecule is a diene, but in this case, it's a mono-ene. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a cross metathesis, but since it's a single alkene, perhaps it just breaks into two smaller alkenes.

Wait, but another possibility: when Grubbs is used, it can cause the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis if possible. So in 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps the end can form a ring by connecting the C1 to the C5, but is that possible?

Wait, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The chain is five carbons long, but the substituent is on C3.

So, the molecule is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3

If it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it would form a ring by connecting C2 to C5, perhaps? Because C2 is at the end of the double bond. So when the double bond breaks, the two ends (CH₂ and CH(CH3)CH2CH3) can combine in different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formed would be a four-membered ring. Let me count the atoms between the double bond ends. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the other end is C5, that's four carbons away. So perhaps the ring would have five members (since it's connecting C1 to C5, which is four bonds apart, making a five-membered ring).

Wait, so the ring would be:

CH₂-CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3

Wait, but when the ring forms, the double bond would be between C1 and C2, and then the ring would connect C2 to, say, C5.

Wait, no, metathesis would break the existing double bond and form a new one between different atoms. So perhaps the product would be a cyclic alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted cyclopentene or something similar.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to break and re-form into a different structure, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, another thought: when Grubbs is used on a mono-alkene, it can cause a process called olefin metathesis, which for a single alkene might result in the exchange of substituents. But in this case, since the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the number of products is limited.

Wait, but wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene is racemic, which implies that the molecule has a chiral center. Wait, does it?

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. The CH(CH3) is on C3. So C3 has four different substituents: CH2CH2 (maybe not, let me see: attached to C3 are CH2 (from C2), CH3, CH2CH3 (from C4), and the other substituent is the CH2 from C2.

Wait, no, wait. Let's see:

C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is a CH group (from CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-...)

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me number the carbons correctly.

Carbon 1: CH₂= 

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH(CH3)- 

Carbon 4: CH₂- 

Carbon 5: CH3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

At C3, the substituents are:

- CH₂ (from C2, which is part of the double bond).

- CH(CH3) (the group itself).

- CH2CH3 (from C4, which is CH₂-CH3).

Wait, no, wait. C3 is attached to:

- C2: which is part of the double bond, so CH₂=CH-.

- C4: which is CH₂-CH3.

Wait, so C3 is attached to two CH₂ groups on either side (C2 and C4), and a methyl group. So the substituents are:

- CH₂ (from C2, part of the double bond, so as CH2-).

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

At C3, we have:

- One bond to C2 (which is CH₂=CH-).

- One bond to C4 (which is CH₂-CH3).

- One bond to a methyl group (CH3).

- And the fourth bond is to the central carbon (C3 itself).

Wait, but wait, for a chiral center, the four substituents must be different. So, looking at C3:

- The substituents are: CH₂ (from C2 double bond), CH₂CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and the central carbon (but that's itself, so not a substituent). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is connected to four different groups.

Wait, C3 is attached to:

- C2 (which is CH2=).

- C4 (which is CH2-).

- CH3 (methyl).

- And the central structure, which is itself, but that's not a substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 isn't a chiral center. Let me think: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Looking at C3, which is connected to:

- CH₂ (from C2, which is part of the double bond).

- CH(CH3) (the main group).

- CH₂-CH3 (from C4).

So the substituents are: a CH2 group (from C2), a CH2CH3 group (from C4), a CH3 group (methyl), and perhaps another CH2 group? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but that's not correct because it's pent-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecule as (CH₂)2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but no, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just proceed.

So, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

When Grubbs catalyst is applied, it can cause the double bond to undergo metathesis. So the double bond breaks, and the two ends can recombine in different ways.

In this case, the two ends are CH₂- and -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So the possible products would be the alkenes formed by swapping these ends.

Wait, but in Grubbs metathesis, the two ends can exchange, so the possible new alkenes would be formed by connecting the different ends.

So, the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Breaking the double bond, we have:

CH₂- and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

These can swap to form:

CH₂-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 = CH2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 → which is the same as before. But wait, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the ends can form new alkenes by combining the CH2 with the other end.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing, but another approach: Grubbs metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes depending on the possible combinations.

So, the initial alkene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Upon metathesis, possible products could be:

1. The original alkene (if it's a ring and just re-forms, but that's not likely).

2. An internal alkene formed by connecting the two ends.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 3-methylcyclopentene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the possible alkenes that can form.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a [2+2] metathesis, but I think Grubbs is more about breaking and reforming double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new alkene where the substituents are swapped.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for the number of possible products when a racemic mixture is treated with Grubbs.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a racemic mixture, which is 50% of each enantiomer. But since Grubbs is a catalyst that doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, perhaps the product will have the same number of possible products regardless of the starting enantiomer.

But wait, in this molecule, would the metathesis lead to different products based on the configuration of the starting material?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mixture of enantiomers, but the product would be a racemic mixture of each possible product.

But wait, the question says to exclude ethene. So any product that is ethylene (ethene) would not be counted.

So the question is, how many possible alkenes can form from the metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene, excluding ethene.

Let me think about the possible alkenes:

The starting material is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Upon metathesis, the ends can break and recombine. So let's imagine the possibilities.

The two ends are CH₂ and the other part is CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but the other part after breaking would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but perhaps that's not correct. Wait, perhaps when the double bond breaks, each end is a metal-carbene complex. So the two ends are CH₂- and -CH(CH3)CH₂CH3.

When these two ends exchange, they can form different alkenes.

So the possibilities are:

1. Re-forming the original double bond: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH₂CH3. But this is the same as the starting material, so perhaps it's a possible product, but the question says to exclude ethene. Wait, no, ethene is CH₂=CH2. So our starting material isn't ethene, so that's fine.

Wait, but the question says to exclude ethene as a product. So any alkenes formed that are ethene would be excluded. But our starting material is more complex than ethene, so perhaps ethene is not a product here.

Wait, but perhaps during the metathesis, some of the products could be ethene. How?

Wait, if the molecule undergoes cleavage into two smaller alkenes. But our molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. If it breaks in such a way that one part is ethene and the other is another alkene.

Wait, let's see: when Grubbs breaks the double bond, could it form ethene and another alkene?

For example, if the CH2 group breaks off, becoming ethene (CH₂=CH2), and the other part would be CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. So the other product would be CH₂=CH(CH(CH3)CH₂CH3?), no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps another way: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

If the double bond breaks between C1 and C2, the two parts are CH2- and CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

These two parts can recombine in different ways.

One possibility is that the CH2 group combines with the other CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, forming CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps they form a new double bond.

Wait, during metathesis, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of the ends. So the two ends can form a new double bond.

So the possible products would be:

1. The original molecule, which is a possible product.

But the question says to exclude ethene, but the original molecule is not ethene.

Wait, but perhaps the metathesis can only form alkenes from the same molecule, but perhaps not, if it's a cross metathesis with another molecule.

Wait, but in this problem, the molecule is treated with Grubbs catalyst, and we're considering the products from the metathesis of the same molecule. So it's a ring-closing or a bond exchange within the same molecule.

Wait, another angle: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

When Grubbs is applied, the double bond can break and the ends can swap, leading to a new arrangement.

So the possible new alkenes would be:

Option 1: The same as the starting material.

Option 2: A different arrangement, perhaps where the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, but the molecule is linear, so perhaps the only way to get a different product is for the double bond to shift.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form a ring.

Wait, if the molecule forms a ring, that would be a cyclic alkene. Let's imagine:

If the chain forms a ring by connecting the two ends, that would create a cyclic structure. So, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the other end is C5, perhaps the ring would have five members (since we're connecting C1 and C5, which are four bonds apart). So that would form a cyclopentene derivative.

So the product would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, the substituents would be where? Let me think. The starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

If the ring forms by connecting C2 and C5, perhaps. So the ring would be:

CH₂-CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, with a double bond between C1 and C2 and the ring formed between C2 and C5.

Wait, but that would create a four-membered ring (since C2 to C5 is four carbons apart, making a four-membered ring including C2 and C5). Hmm, a four-membered ring might not be favorable, but it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is five-membered, which is more favorable.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is formed by connecting C1 to C5, that would make a five-membered ring.

So the structure would be:

C1 (CH₂) connected to C2 (CH), which is double bonded to C1.

Then, C2 is connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), C3 to C4 (CH2), C4 to C5 (CH3), and C5 back to C1.

Wait, that would form a five-membered ring. The double bond would then be between C1 and C2, making it a cyclopentene derivative.

So the product would be a substituted cyclopentene.

But in this scenario, how many possible products are there?

Wait, the starting material is racemic, which suggests that there are two enantiomers present. But when treated with Grubbs, which is a chiral catalyst? Wait, no, Grubbs catalyst is achiral, I think. So the products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

But wait, the starting material has a chiral center. So in this molecule, does C3 have four different substituents?

Let's check:

At C3:

- Connected to C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- Connected to C4 (CH₂-CH3).

- Has a methyl group (CH3).

- And one more bond, which is to another CH2 (from C2, but perhaps that's the same as C2's substituent, making it not a unique substituent).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine the structure.

The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

At C3, the substituents are:

- A CH₂ group from C2 (which is part of the double bond).

- A CH₂CH3 group (from C4).

- A methyl group (CH3).

Wait, but CH₂ (from C2) is part of the double bond, so perhaps the substituents at C3 are:

- One bond to C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- One bond to C4 (CH₂CH3).

- One bond to CH3.

- And the fourth bond is to the C3 itself.

Wait, so at C3, the substituents are:

- CH₂=CH- (from C2).

- CH(CH3) (the group itself, but that's not a substituent).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think of C3 as attached to:

- C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- C4 (CH₂-CH3).

- CH3 (methyl).

- And the fourth substituent would be another CH₂ group from where? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe C3 has two CH₂ groups attached. So that would make it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps C3 is attached to:

- C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- C4 (CH₂-CH3).

- CH3.

- And another CH2 group? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the structure again. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH₂= 

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-

Carbon 4: CH₂-

Carbon 5: CH3.

So looking at the substituents on C3:

- Carbon 2: CH₂= (from the double bond).

- Carbon 4: CH₂-.

- Methyl (CH3).

Wait, but that's only three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is a CH group (part of the double bond).

- C4: which is a CH2 group.

- A methyl group (CH3).

- And another bond, which is the CH group itself, which isn't a substituent but rather the central point.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that C3 has a methyl group attached, and perhaps the other substituents are CH₂ groups, making it a chiral center.

So if the molecule is racemic, it must have a chiral center. So perhaps C3 is a chiral center, making the molecule have two enantiomers.

When Grubbs is applied, the product would retain the configuration if the reaction doesn't break the chiral center.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible products.

If the metathesis leads to a ring formation, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. How many isomers would that have?

Wait, if the ring is formed, the substituents would be in specific positions. For example, the methyl group might be in a certain position on the ring.

But since the starting material is racemic, the products could form different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in more than one way, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, the starting molecule is a mono-ene, so the only way to form a ring is via the existing double bond. So the ring would be formed by connecting the two ends, leading to a single cyclopentene derivative.

But wait, considering the structure, there might be more than one way to form the ring.

Wait, another possibility: the double bond can undergo a shift during the metathesis. So, perhaps the product isn't a ring but another alkene with the double bond in a different position.

But I'm not certain about that. Another angle: perhaps the metathesis doesn't form a ring but instead leads to a different mono-alkene.

Wait, but the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. If the double bond breaks and the ends recombine, perhaps the product is a different mono-alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a smaller alkene and another fragment, but that would require cleavage, which I'm not sure Grubbs does.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible products from the metathesis.

The starting material is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Possible products after metathesis:

1. The same molecule (but that's the starting material, so it's a possible product).

2. A cyclic product, perhaps a substituted cyclopentene.

3. Another mono-alkene with the double bond in a different position.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the only product is the cyclic one, so the number of possible products would be 1, but that's not among the options.

Wait, the options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible alkenes that can form.

Another approach: the molecule can undergo a [2+2] metathesis, leading to a ring. So the product would be a cycloalkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-opening metathesis if it's part of a ring, but in this case, it's not.

Wait, perhaps the initial molecule isn't part of a ring, so maybe the only product is a ring-closing metathesis product.

But if the ring is formed, how many isomers are possible?

In the case of a cyclopentene derivative, the substituents could be in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, the substituents in the ring would determine the number of possible products.

In the starting molecule, the substituents are at C3 (a methyl group) and perhaps others.

Wait, when the ring forms, the substituents would be at specific positions. For example, the methyl group would end up in a certain position on the ring.

But since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the ring can form in two different configurations, leading to two distinct products.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in only one way, leading to a single product.

Wait, but this isn't clear. Another thought: perhaps the metathesis leads to two possible products, each with a different configuration.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible products in terms of the options given.

The options are 2,4,6,8.

If the metathesis leads to two different products, the answer would be D) 2.

But why two?

Wait, perhaps because the starting material is racemic, and the metathesis can lead to two different products based on the configuration of the starting enantiomer.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst is achiral, so it wouldn't distinguish between the enantiomers. So perhaps the products would be the same, regardless of the starting configuration.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

Wait, another approach: let's draw the structure.

The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

When it undergoes metathesis, the double bond breaks, and the ends can swap.

So the possible products could be:

1. CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3 (same as starting material).

2. CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3 (same again, perhaps no change).

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the ends can form a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is a different mono-alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but the starting material is a mono-ene.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new double bond between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a smaller alkene and another fragment, but that would require cleavage, which I'm not sure Grubbs does.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different structure, leading to two possible products.

But then why would the number of products be 2?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different rings, leading to two products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a cyclopropane or another small ring, but that's not likely with Grubbs.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a five-membered ring, which is more favorable, and in doing so, creates a new chiral center, leading to two possible enantiomers.

But then those would be a pair of enantiomers, which would count as one product, not two.

Wait, but the question excludes ethene, so it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each of which is a diastereomer, perhaps.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: perhaps the number of possible products is 2, based on the possible sites of metathesis.

Wait, but in the molecule, the metathesis can occur between different pairs of carbons.

Wait, but the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

The possible double bonds that can form after metathesis would be between:

- C1 and C2 (original).

- C2 and C3.

- C3 and C4.

- C4 and C5.

But wait, after metathesis, the new double bonds could be formed.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new double bond between C2 and C3.

So the product would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, but that's not possible because the double bond would have to form.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different mono-alkene, leading to two possible structures.

But without knowing exactly, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products in terms of the number of possible alkenes that can form from the metathesis.

So, when Grubbs is used on 3-methylpent-1-ene, it can form either the same molecule or a different one.

But the question says to exclude ethene, which isn't formed here.

Wait, perhaps the only product is the same molecule, so the number of products is 1. But that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different alkenes, each with a double bond in a different position.

For example:

1. The original double bond between C1 and C2.

2. A new double bond between C2 and C3.

But that would require some shift during metathesis.

Wait, but I'm not sure if Grubbs can cause such a shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to a new double bond between C3 and C4.

But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another way: the molecule can form two different alkenes, so the number of possible products is 2.

In that case, the answer would be D) 2.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Another possibility: the molecule can undergo metathesis to form a cyclic product and a linear product.

So, for example, the ring-closing metathesis forms a cyclopentene, and another product is a different linear alkene.

In that case, there would be two products, so the answer is D) 2.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the original molecule is a mono-ene, so perhaps the only possible product is the same molecule, leading to just one product.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the metathesis can lead to two different products based on the configuration of the starting material.

Since the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer leads to a different product.

But if the catalyst is achiral, then the products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer would form a different diastereomer, leading to two products.

But then the total number of products would be two, making the answer D) 2.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: the starting molecule is a mixture of two enantiomers. Each enantiomer would lead to the same product because the reaction is the same for both.

So the number of products would be the same as if only one enantiomer was present.

So perhaps the number of products is 2, which would be option D.

But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different structure, so the number is 2.

In that case, the answer is D) 2.

So, after all this thinking, I'm going to conclude that the number of possible products is 2.

Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis, where double bonds are broken and reformed. The starting material, racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The racemic nature indicates the molecule has a chiral center at C3, with two enantiomers present in equal amounts.

When treated with Grubbs catalyst, the double bond between C1 and C2 can undergo metathesis. This involves breaking the double bond and recombining the ends in different ways. The possible outcomes include:

1. **Reforming the original double bond**: This would yield the same molecule as the starting material, CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. However, the question specifies excluding ethene (CH₂=CH₂), and this product is not ethene, so it is valid.

2. **Forming a new double bond**: The ends of the molecule can recombine to form a different alkene. This could involve shifting the double bond to a different position or forming a cyclic product. For example, the double bond could shift to C2-C3 or C3-C4, or the molecule could undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopentene derivative.

The racemic nature of the starting material means that the two enantiomers could lead to different products if the reaction is stereospecific. However, Grubbs catalyst is achiral and does not distinguish between enantiomers, so the reaction would proceed similarly for both enantiomers, leading to the same set of products.

Considering the possible products and excluding ethene, the reaction can yield two distinct alkenes: one with the original double bond and another with a shifted or cyclic structure. Thus, there are **two possible products**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So it's like swapping the ends of the alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Let me draw the structure. Pent means five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Because pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, I think. Oh wait, no, actually, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But in this case, it's 3-methyl, so on carbon 3, which is the third carbon from the double bond. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 and C5 are CH2 and CH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst induces metathesis. So when you have an alkene treated with a Grubbs catalyst, it can undergo ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening, but more commonly, it's ring-closing when a diene is present. Wait, but in this case, we have a mono-ene. Oh, wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong scenario.

Alternatively, wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis which can include breaking a double bond and reforming it. So 3-methylpent-1-ene, when treated with Grubbs, could undergo a ring-closing metathesis if possible, but but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mono-ene, so maybe it's not going to form a ring. Or maybe it can undergo some other kind of metathesis.

Wait, another thought: metathesis can involve the breaking of the double bond into two fragments and swapping the ends. So for a molecule like CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, when Grubbs is applied, the double bond breaks, and the two ends (the two CH₂ groups) swap. So the two ends would be CH₂ and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the possible products would be the different ways these can recombine.

Wait, but wait. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for olefin metathesis. The reaction can proceed via a mechanism where the catalyst binds to the alkene, breaking the double bond and forming metal-alkylidene complexes. Then, these complexes can exchange their alkylidene groups, leading to the formation of new alkenes.

So in the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

When it undergoes metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond, and the two parts (CH₂ and the rest) can swap partners. So the possible products would be from combining the different ends.

Wait, but wait. If the original is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, breaking the double bond would give two parts: CH₂– and –CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Then, the catalyst would facilitate swapping, allowing the ends to pair in different ways.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the molecule would form a ring if possible. But in this case, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Wait, I think I might have messed up the structure. Let me correct that.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So when Grubbs is applied, the double bond breaks, and the two ends can swap. So the possible products would be all the possible alkenes that can form from the metathesis.

Wait, but sometimes in metathesis, you can get different alkenes based on where the breaks occur. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring-closing if the chain is long enough. Let me check the carbon chain length. Pent means five carbons, so the chain is five carbons long, but with a substituent.

Wait, so the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH₃. So, the chain is five carbons, with a methyl on the third carbon.

When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bond and then recombine the ends in different ways. So the two ends are CH₂– and –CH(CH3)CH₂CH3.

Wait, but when the double bond breaks, each end becomes a metal carbene, which can exchange partners. So the possible products would be the different alkenes formed from the possible combinations.

Wait, so for a molecule like CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, the possible products would be:

If the two CH₂ groups are swapped, maybe?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Another approach: when Grubbs is used on an alkene, what happens? It can either break the alkene into two fragments and swap them, leading to a new alkene, or if the molecule can form a ring, it might form a cyclic product.

Wait, but for this molecule, if it undergoes ring-closing, how long a ring would that be? The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the other end is C5. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So from C1 to C5 would be four bonds away. Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the chain is five carbons, so the distance between the two ends is three carbons apart. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic structure. So the number of possible products would depend on how many different rings can form, and whether there are any other products.

Wait, but if the molecule is treated with Grubbs, which is a first-generation catalyst, it's more likely to perform ring-closing metathesis if the molecule is a diene, but in this case, it's a mono-ene. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a cross metathesis, but since it's a single alkene, perhaps it just breaks into two smaller alkenes.

Wait, but another possibility: when Grubbs is used, it can cause the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis if possible. So in 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps the end can form a ring by connecting the C1 to the C5, but is that possible?

Wait, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The chain is five carbons long, but the substituent is on C3.

So, the molecule is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3

If it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it would form a ring by connecting C2 to C5, perhaps? Because C2 is at the end of the double bond. So when the double bond breaks, the two ends (CH₂ and CH(CH3)CH2CH3) can combine in different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formed would be a four-membered ring. Let me count the atoms between the double bond ends. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the other end is C5, that's four carbons away. So perhaps the ring would have five members (since it's connecting C1 to C5, which is four bonds apart, making a five-membered ring).

Wait, so the ring would be:

CH₂-CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3

Wait, but when the ring forms, the double bond would be between C1 and C2, and then the ring would connect C2 to, say, C5.

Wait, no, metathesis would break the existing double bond and form a new one between different atoms. So perhaps the product would be a cyclic alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted cyclopentene or something similar.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to break and re-form into a different structure, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, another thought: when Grubbs is used on a mono-alkene, it can cause a process called olefin metathesis, which for a single alkene might result in the exchange of substituents. But in this case, since the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the number of products is limited.

Wait, but wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene is racemic, which implies that the molecule has a chiral center. Wait, does it?

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. The CH(CH3) is on C3. So C3 has four different substituents: CH2CH2 (maybe not, let me see: attached to C3 are CH2 (from C2), CH3, CH2CH3 (from C4), and the other substituent is the CH2 from C2.

Wait, no, wait. Let's see:

C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is a CH group (from CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-...)

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me number the carbons correctly.

Carbon 1: CH₂= 

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH(CH3)- 

Carbon 4: CH₂- 

Carbon 5: CH3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

At C3, the substituents are:

- CH₂ (from C2, which is part of the double bond).

- CH(CH3) (the group itself).

- CH2CH3 (from C4, which is CH₂-CH3).

Wait, no, wait. C3 is attached to:

- C2: which is part of the double bond, so CH₂=CH-.

- C4: which is CH₂-CH3.

Wait, so C3 is attached to two CH₂ groups on either side (C2 and C4), and a methyl group. So the substituents are:

- CH₂ (from C2, part of the double bond, so as CH2-).

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

At C3, we have:

- One bond to C2 (which is CH₂=CH-).

- One bond to C4 (which is CH₂-CH3).

- One bond to a methyl group (CH3).

- And the fourth bond is to the central carbon (C3 itself).

Wait, but wait, for a chiral center, the four substituents must be different. So, looking at C3:

- The substituents are: CH₂ (from C2 double bond), CH₂CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and the central carbon (but that's itself, so not a substituent). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is connected to four different groups.

Wait, C3 is attached to:

- C2 (which is CH2=).

- C4 (which is CH2-).

- CH3 (methyl).

- And the central structure, which is itself, but that's not a substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 isn't a chiral center. Let me think: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Looking at C3, which is connected to:

- CH₂ (from C2, which is part of the double bond).

- CH(CH3) (the main group).

- CH₂-CH3 (from C4).

So the substituents are: a CH2 group (from C2), a CH2CH3 group (from C4), a CH3 group (methyl), and perhaps another CH2 group? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but that's not correct because it's pent-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecule as (CH₂)2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but no, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just proceed.

So, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

When Grubbs catalyst is applied, it can cause the double bond to undergo metathesis. So the double bond breaks, and the two ends can recombine in different ways.

In this case, the two ends are CH₂- and -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So the possible products would be the alkenes formed by swapping these ends.

Wait, but in Grubbs metathesis, the two ends can exchange, so the possible new alkenes would be formed by connecting the different ends.

So, the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Breaking the double bond, we have:

CH₂- and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

These can swap to form:

CH₂-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 = CH2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 → which is the same as before. But wait, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the ends can form new alkenes by combining the CH2 with the other end.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing, but another approach: Grubbs metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes depending on the possible combinations.

So, the initial alkene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Upon metathesis, possible products could be:

1. The original alkene (if it's a ring and just re-forms, but that's not likely).

2. An internal alkene formed by connecting the two ends.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 3-methylcyclopentene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the possible alkenes that can form.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a [2+2] metathesis, but I think Grubbs is more about breaking and reforming double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new alkene where the substituents are swapped.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for the number of possible products when a racemic mixture is treated with Grubbs.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a racemic mixture, which is 50% of each enantiomer. But since Grubbs is a catalyst that doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, perhaps the product will have the same number of possible products regardless of the starting enantiomer.

But wait, in this molecule, would the metathesis lead to different products based on the configuration of the starting material?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mixture of enantiomers, but the product would be a racemic mixture of each possible product.

But wait, the question says to exclude ethene. So any product that is ethylene (ethene) would not be counted.

So the question is, how many possible alkenes can form from the metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene, excluding ethene.

Let me think about the possible alkenes:

The starting material is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Upon metathesis, the ends can break and recombine. So let's imagine the possibilities.

The two ends are CH₂ and the other part is CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but the other part after breaking would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but perhaps that's not correct. Wait, perhaps when the double bond breaks, each end is a metal-carbene complex. So the two ends are CH₂- and -CH(CH3)CH₂CH3.

When these two ends exchange, they can form different alkenes.

So the possibilities are:

1. Re-forming the original double bond: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH₂CH3. But this is the same as the starting material, so perhaps it's a possible product, but the question says to exclude ethene. Wait, no, ethene is CH₂=CH2. So our starting material isn't ethene, so that's fine.

Wait, but the question says to exclude ethene as a product. So any alkenes formed that are ethene would be excluded. But our starting material is more complex than ethene, so perhaps ethene is not a product here.

Wait, but perhaps during the metathesis, some of the products could be ethene. How?

Wait, if the molecule undergoes cleavage into two smaller alkenes. But our molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. If it breaks in such a way that one part is ethene and the other is another alkene.

Wait, let's see: when Grubbs breaks the double bond, could it form ethene and another alkene?

For example, if the CH2 group breaks off, becoming ethene (CH₂=CH2), and the other part would be CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. So the other product would be CH₂=CH(CH(CH3)CH₂CH3?), no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps another way: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

If the double bond breaks between C1 and C2, the two parts are CH2- and CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

These two parts can recombine in different ways.

One possibility is that the CH2 group combines with the other CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, forming CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps they form a new double bond.

Wait, during metathesis, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of the ends. So the two ends can form a new double bond.

So the possible products would be:

1. The original molecule, which is a possible product.

But the question says to exclude ethene, but the original molecule is not ethene.

Wait, but perhaps the metathesis can only form alkenes from the same molecule, but perhaps not, if it's a cross metathesis with another molecule.

Wait, but in this problem, the molecule is treated with Grubbs catalyst, and we're considering the products from the metathesis of the same molecule. So it's a ring-closing or a bond exchange within the same molecule.

Wait, another angle: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

When Grubbs is applied, the double bond can break and the ends can swap, leading to a new arrangement.

So the possible new alkenes would be:

Option 1: The same as the starting material.

Option 2: A different arrangement, perhaps where the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, but the molecule is linear, so perhaps the only way to get a different product is for the double bond to shift.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form a ring.

Wait, if the molecule forms a ring, that would be a cyclic alkene. Let's imagine:

If the chain forms a ring by connecting the two ends, that would create a cyclic structure. So, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the other end is C5, perhaps the ring would have five members (since we're connecting C1 and C5, which are four bonds apart). So that would form a cyclopentene derivative.

So the product would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, the substituents would be where? Let me think. The starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

If the ring forms by connecting C2 and C5, perhaps. So the ring would be:

CH₂-CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, with a double bond between C1 and C2 and the ring formed between C2 and C5.

Wait, but that would create a four-membered ring (since C2 to C5 is four carbons apart, making a four-membered ring including C2 and C5). Hmm, a four-membered ring might not be favorable, but it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is five-membered, which is more favorable.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is formed by connecting C1 to C5, that would make a five-membered ring.

So the structure would be:

C1 (CH₂) connected to C2 (CH), which is double bonded to C1.

Then, C2 is connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), C3 to C4 (CH2), C4 to C5 (CH3), and C5 back to C1.

Wait, that would form a five-membered ring. The double bond would then be between C1 and C2, making it a cyclopentene derivative.

So the product would be a substituted cyclopentene.

But in this scenario, how many possible products are there?

Wait, the starting material is racemic, which suggests that there are two enantiomers present. But when treated with Grubbs, which is a chiral catalyst? Wait, no, Grubbs catalyst is achiral, I think. So the products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

But wait, the starting material has a chiral center. So in this molecule, does C3 have four different substituents?

Let's check:

At C3:

- Connected to C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- Connected to C4 (CH₂-CH3).

- Has a methyl group (CH3).

- And one more bond, which is to another CH2 (from C2, but perhaps that's the same as C2's substituent, making it not a unique substituent).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine the structure.

The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

At C3, the substituents are:

- A CH₂ group from C2 (which is part of the double bond).

- A CH₂CH3 group (from C4).

- A methyl group (CH3).

Wait, but CH₂ (from C2) is part of the double bond, so perhaps the substituents at C3 are:

- One bond to C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- One bond to C4 (CH₂CH3).

- One bond to CH3.

- And the fourth bond is to the C3 itself.

Wait, so at C3, the substituents are:

- CH₂=CH- (from C2).

- CH(CH3) (the group itself, but that's not a substituent).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think of C3 as attached to:

- C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- C4 (CH₂-CH3).

- CH3 (methyl).

- And the fourth substituent would be another CH₂ group from where? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe C3 has two CH₂ groups attached. So that would make it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps C3 is attached to:

- C2 (CH₂=CH-).

- C4 (CH₂-CH3).

- CH3.

- And another CH2 group? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the structure again. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH₂= 

Carbon 2: CH-

Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-

Carbon 4: CH₂-

Carbon 5: CH3.

So looking at the substituents on C3:

- Carbon 2: CH₂= (from the double bond).

- Carbon 4: CH₂-.

- Methyl (CH3).

Wait, but that's only three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is a CH group (part of the double bond).

- C4: which is a CH2 group.

- A methyl group (CH3).

- And another bond, which is the CH group itself, which isn't a substituent but rather the central point.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that C3 has a methyl group attached, and perhaps the other substituents are CH₂ groups, making it a chiral center.

So if the molecule is racemic, it must have a chiral center. So perhaps C3 is a chiral center, making the molecule have two enantiomers.

When Grubbs is applied, the product would retain the configuration if the reaction doesn't break the chiral center.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible products.

If the metathesis leads to a ring formation, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. How many isomers would that have?

Wait, if the ring is formed, the substituents would be in specific positions. For example, the methyl group might be in a certain position on the ring.

But since the starting material is racemic, the products could form different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in more than one way, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, the starting molecule is a mono-ene, so the only way to form a ring is via the existing double bond. So the ring would be formed by connecting the two ends, leading to a single cyclopentene derivative.

But wait, considering the structure, there might be more than one way to form the ring.

Wait, another possibility: the double bond can undergo a shift during the metathesis. So, perhaps the product isn't a ring but another alkene with the double bond in a different position.

But I'm not certain about that. Another angle: perhaps the metathesis doesn't form a ring but instead leads to a different mono-alkene.

Wait, but the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. If the double bond breaks and the ends recombine, perhaps the product is a different mono-alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a smaller alkene and another fragment, but that would require cleavage, which I'm not sure Grubbs does.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible products from the metathesis.

The starting material is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Possible products after metathesis:

1. The same molecule (but that's the starting material, so it's a possible product).

2. A cyclic product, perhaps a substituted cyclopentene.

3. Another mono-alkene with the double bond in a different position.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the only product is the cyclic one, so the number of possible products would be 1, but that's not among the options.

Wait, the options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible alkenes that can form.

Another approach: the molecule can undergo a [2+2] metathesis, leading to a ring. So the product would be a cycloalkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-opening metathesis if it's part of a ring, but in this case, it's not.

Wait, perhaps the initial molecule isn't part of a ring, so maybe the only product is a ring-closing metathesis product.

But if the ring is formed, how many isomers are possible?

In the case of a cyclopentene derivative, the substituents could be in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, the substituents in the ring would determine the number of possible products.

In the starting molecule, the substituents are at C3 (a methyl group) and perhaps others.

Wait, when the ring forms, the substituents would be at specific positions. For example, the methyl group would end up in a certain position on the ring.

But since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the ring can form in two different configurations, leading to two distinct products.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in only one way, leading to a single product.

Wait, but this isn't clear. Another thought: perhaps the metathesis leads to two possible products, each with a different configuration.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible products in terms of the options given.

The options are 2,4,6,8.

If the metathesis leads to two different products, the answer would be D) 2.

But why two?

Wait, perhaps because the starting material is racemic, and the metathesis can lead to two different products based on the configuration of the starting enantiomer.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst is achiral, so it wouldn't distinguish between the enantiomers. So perhaps the products would be the same, regardless of the starting configuration.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

Wait, another approach: let's draw the structure.

The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

When it undergoes metathesis, the double bond breaks, and the ends can swap.

So the possible products could be:

1. CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3 (same as starting material).

2. CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3 (same again, perhaps no change).

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the ends can form a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is a different mono-alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but the starting material is a mono-ene.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new double bond between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a smaller alkene and another fragment, but that would require cleavage, which I'm not sure Grubbs does.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different structure, leading to two possible products.

But then why would the number of products be 2?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different rings, leading to two products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a cyclopropane or another small ring, but that's not likely with Grubbs.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a five-membered ring, which is more favorable, and in doing so, creates a new chiral center, leading to two possible enantiomers.

But then those would be a pair of enantiomers, which would count as one product, not two.

Wait, but the question excludes ethene, so it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each of which is a diastereomer, perhaps.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: perhaps the number of possible products is 2, based on the possible sites of metathesis.

Wait, but in the molecule, the metathesis can occur between different pairs of carbons.

Wait, but the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

The possible double bonds that can form after metathesis would be between:

- C1 and C2 (original).

- C2 and C3.

- C3 and C4.

- C4 and C5.

But wait, after metathesis, the new double bonds could be formed.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new double bond between C2 and C3.

So the product would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, but that's not possible because the double bond would have to form.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different mono-alkene, leading to two possible structures.

But without knowing exactly, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products in terms of the number of possible alkenes that can form from the metathesis.

So, when Grubbs is used on 3-methylpent-1-ene, it can form either the same molecule or a different one.

But the question says to exclude ethene, which isn't formed here.

Wait, perhaps the only product is the same molecule, so the number of products is 1. But that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different alkenes, each with a double bond in a different position.

For example:

1. The original double bond between C1 and C2.

2. A new double bond between C2 and C3.

But that would require some shift during metathesis.

Wait, but I'm not sure if Grubbs can cause such a shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to a new double bond between C3 and C4.

But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another way: the molecule can form two different alkenes, so the number of possible products is 2.

In that case, the answer would be D) 2.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Another possibility: the molecule can undergo metathesis to form a cyclic product and a linear product.

So, for example, the ring-closing metathesis forms a cyclopentene, and another product is a different linear alkene.

In that case, there would be two products, so the answer is D) 2.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the original molecule is a mono-ene, so perhaps the only possible product is the same molecule, leading to just one product.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the metathesis can lead to two different products based on the configuration of the starting material.

Since the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer leads to a different product.

But if the catalyst is achiral, then the products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer would form a different diastereomer, leading to two products.

But then the total number of products would be two, making the answer D) 2.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: the starting molecule is a mixture of two enantiomers. Each enantiomer would lead to the same product because the reaction is the same for both.

So the number of products would be the same as if only one enantiomer was present.

So perhaps the number of products is 2, which would be option D.

But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different structure, so the number is 2.

In that case, the answer is D) 2.

So, after all this thinking, I'm going to conclude that the number of possible products is 2.


Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis, where double bonds are broken and reformed. The starting material, racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The racemic nature indicates the molecule has a chiral center at C3, with two enantiomers present in equal amounts.

When treated with Grubbs catalyst, the double bond between C1 and C2 can undergo metathesis. This involves breaking the double bond and recombining the ends in different ways. The possible outcomes include:

1. **Reforming the original double bond**: This would yield the same molecule as the starting material, CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. However, the question specifies excluding ethene (CH₂=CH₂), and this product is not ethene, so it is valid.

2. **Forming a new double bond**: The ends of the molecule can recombine to form a different alkene. This could involve shifting the double bond to a different position or forming a cyclic product. For example, the double bond could shift to C2-C3 or C3-C4, or the molecule could undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopentene derivative.

The racemic nature of the starting material means that the two enantiomers could lead to different products if the reaction is stereospecific. However, Grubbs catalyst is achiral and does not distinguish between enantiomers, so the reaction would proceed similarly for both enantiomers, leading to the same set of products.

Considering the possible products and excluding ethene, the reaction can yield two distinct alkenes: one with the original double bond and another with a shifted or cyclic structure. Thus, there are **two possible products**.

Answer: D
