Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an atom that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but I remember that radioactive decay has something to do with half-lives and probability.

Wait, the question says that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%. Oh right, so the probability that the atom decays in a certain time is given. But I'm a bit confused about how that works. Do I use the half-life formula here?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay constant. I remember that the decay law is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But how does that relate to the probability given?

So, the decay probability within time t is 1 - e^(-λt). Because e^(-λt) is the probability it hasn't decayed, so 1 minus that is the chance it has decayed by time t. Oh, right. So the question tells us that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So we can set up the equation 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). 

Let me solve for λ. Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3), which is about -0.4055. Wait, wait: 0.68 is approximately e^(-0.4005) because e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me think: ln(0.68) is around -0.38566? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it exactly. Let me calculate it. Alternatively, maybe I can just proceed symbolically for now.

So λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100. Wait, because ln(0.68) is negative, so -ln(0.68) is positive. So λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100. Let me compute that:

1 / 0.68 is approximately 1.470588. ln(1.470588) is about 0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact values. Another approach: Let me calculate ln(0.68) using a calculator. Wait, I don't have a calculator, but I can remember that ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is between those. Hmm, let's see, 0.68 is closer to 0.7. Let me think: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50, the remaining probability is what we're after.

Wait, but when dealing with radioactive decay, the probability of decay is independent of the time elapsed. That is, the probability of decaying in an interval is only dependent on the time since the last decay, not the absolute time. So the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't change the current decay probability—it's memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as it was at any previous point, given that it hasn't decayed yet.

Wait, so the decay is a Poisson process, and it has the memoryless property. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of how long it's been since the start.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32. So the decay constant λ is determined based on that. Now, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, so the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and then we're looking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes. But because of the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, regardless of the 50-minute wait.

Wait, no. Because the decay probability depends on the time. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The probability that the atom decays in the next T minutes, given no decay in the first t minutes, is the same as the probability that it decays between t and t+T minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the probability is 1 - e^(-λT). Because the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first t minutes doesn't affect the future probability. So the probability is the same as if we started a new timer.

Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability of decay in the next T minutes after time t is the same as the probability of decay in any interval of length T, because of the memoryless property. So, the decay probability for T minutes is 1 - e^(-λT), regardless of how much time has passed before.

Wait, but that can't be right because the probability to decay in the next 100 minutes is 0.32, so for 150 minutes it would be higher. So in this problem, the time after t=50, we're considering T=150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Wait, but we need to compute λ, given that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. So λ is (ln(1/0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So for the next 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150).

Calculating that exponent: 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849. So e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5615. So 1 - 0.5615 ≈ 0.4385, or 43.85%. But the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent. Let me recalculate.

Wait, λ is 0.0038566 per minute. So 150 * 0.0038566 = 0.57849. e^-0.57849 is approximately?

Well, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Alternatively, calculate it more accurately. Let me think: 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785.

The Taylor series expansion around x=0 for e^-x is 1 - x + x²/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24 - ... 

So for x=0.5785:

e^-x ≈ 1 - 0.5785 + (0.5785)^2 / 2 - (0.5785)^3 /6 + (0.5785)^4 /24.

Compute each term:

0.5785^2 = about 0.3347; 0.3347 /2 ≈ 0.16735.

0.5785^3 ≈ 0.5785 * 0.3347 ≈ 0.1938; 0.1938 /6 ≈ 0.0323.

0.5785^4 ≈ 0.1938 * 0.5785 ≈ 0.1126; 0.1126 /24 ≈ 0.00469.

So putting it together:

1 - 0.5785 = 0.4215.

Plus 0.16735: 0.4215 + 0.16735 = 0.58885.

Minus 0.0323: 0.58885 -0.0323 = 0.55655.

Plus 0.00469: 0.55655 +0.00469=0.56124.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.56124. So 1 - 0.56124 ≈ 0.43876, or about 43.88%. So approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are A)44%, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of λ. Let me recalculate λ.

We had 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ), so e^(-100λ) = 0.68.

Take natural log: -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

I think ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute. That seems correct.

So then 150 minutes: λ*150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56124 → 1-0.56124=0.43876, which is 43.876%, so about 44%. So option A is 44%, which would be the answer.

Wait a second, but another approach: the decay is exponential, so the probability of decay in time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So after 50 minutes, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150). But wait, is that correct, or do I need to consider the time that has already passed?

Wait, no. Because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of the previous 50 minutes. So the calculation is correct as I did before.

So the answer should be 44%, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom decaying within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t},
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68).
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}.
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we calculate:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we determine the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The probability of decay in any time interval \( t \) is independent of the time elapsed before the interval, due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay. Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849.
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56124.
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56124 \approx 0.43876,
\]

or approximately 43.88%. Rounding to the nearest whole number, this is 44%.

Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**, corresponding to option **A**.

e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56124 → 1-0.56124=0.43876, which is 43.876%, so about 44%. So option A is 44%, which would be the answer.

So the answer should be 44%, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom decaying within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t},
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68).
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}.
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we calculate:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we determine the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The probability of decay in any time interval \( t \) is independent of the time elapsed before the interval, due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay. Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849.
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56124.
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56124 \approx 0.43876,
\]

or approximately 43.88%. Rounding to the nearest whole number, this is 44%.

Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**, corresponding to option **A**.
