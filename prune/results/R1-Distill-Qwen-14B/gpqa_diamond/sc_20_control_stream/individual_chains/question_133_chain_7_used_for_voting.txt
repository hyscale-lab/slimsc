Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The temperatures given are 25°C, which I think is room temperature, so standard conditions.

I remember that orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion. So, I need to find how much of that is in solution. Hmm, but wait, I think phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The problem mentions H3PO4's Ka values—Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3. So, I probably have to consider the pH of the solution to figure out the predominant form of phosphate.

First, let me look at the substances. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other compound is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate. It should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I remember that these can interconvert based on the pH. The phosphate species are in equilibrium:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-

The K values given are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

I think the idea is that the solution acts as a buffer because we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent species in the dissociation series. So, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then determine the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), which is the deprotonated form. Given that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^-/HPO4^2-, the pH should be around the pKa2.

Let me compute the moles of each component.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4:
Molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So, moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005617 mol.

So in solution, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028085 M.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-. So the moles are correct.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.028085 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.765.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved in the second Ka):

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 1e-8, so pKa2 = ~7.208 (since 1e-7 is pH7, 6.2e-8 is slightly less than 1e-7, so pKa2 is 7.208).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute pKa2 correctly. pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that.

log(6.2) is about 0.7924. So, log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076, approximately.

So, plugging into HH equation:

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.765)

What's log(0.765)? Let me think. Log(0.7) is about -0.155, log(0.76) is about -0.117, and log(0.765) is around -0.115.

So pH ≈7.2076 -0.115 = 7.0926.

So the pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in solution. Hmm. Because in solution, phosphate can exist as HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, H2PO4^-, and H3PO4, depending on pH.

But at pH 7.09, which is below pKa3 (which is about 12, since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 ≈11.74). So, at pH 7.09, the predominant species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But wait, the question is about PO4^3- concentration, which is the fully deprotonated form. Since the pH is much lower than pKa3, PO4^3- would be very low.

So, perhaps I can model the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation step.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the solution is quite acidic compared to pKa3. So the HPO4^2- will mostly stay as HPO4^2- and not deprotonate further into PO4^3-.

But wait, even a small amount will form. So the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the Ka3 expression.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We know [H+] at pH 7.09 is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So rearranging the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, no, the equation is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

Substituting the values:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12
[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M (from earlier)
[H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, wait, no. Because the solution's pH is 7.09, [H+] is 10^-7.09, which is approximately 8.23e-8 M.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ) / (8.23e-8 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = approx 5.0553e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So 5.0553e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0553 /8.23 ) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.614 * 1e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but that's about 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 and option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that all the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2-?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the contribution from H2PO4^- as well. Because H2PO4^- can also lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but under the given pH, which is lower than pKa2 (so H2PO4^- is more likely), but perhaps some HPO4^2- comes from H2PO4^-.

But wait, no. Because in the buffer solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, and H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4. So in the solution, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M, and [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M.

Wait, but in reality, the solution could have some PO4^3- from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-. Because H2PO4^- can lose another proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but if I have both species, maybe I need to consider the total concentration.

Wait, but in the solution, the PO4^3- concentration is only coming from the HPO4^2- losing a proton. Because the H2PO4^- is more likely to gain a proton to form H3PO4, but in this case, the pH is 7.09, which is around pKa2 (7.2076). Wait, no, wait pKa2 is 7.2076, so pH 7.09 is slightly below pKa2, so H2PO4^- is more prevalent than HPO4^2-.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- which form a buffer. The pH is 7.09, which is just a bit lower than pKa2 (7.2076). So, the majority of the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and a smaller amount of HPO4^2-.

But the question is about PO4^3- concentration. PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- dissociating further, but considering that the pH is much lower than pKa3, the amount should be very small.

So, the [PO4^3-] is primarily determined by the HPO4^2- concentration and the third dissociation.

Wait, but there's another point. HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. So, the concentration of PO4^3- will be [HPO4^2-] * (Ka3 / [H+]).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So, the calculation led to approx 6.14e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. So perhaps my calculation is correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations more accurately.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

Volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^-:

0.007343 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036715 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

pH = 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ let's compute that more accurately.

10^-7.09: 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.09 is about 0.812 (since 10^-0.1 ≈ 0.794, but 0.09 is a bit less, so 0.812). So 1e-7 * 0.812 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So [H+] = 8.12e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.12e-8 )

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = (1.8 * 0.028085) * 1e-12 = 0.050553 * 1e-12 =5.0553e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So 5.0553e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0553 / 8.12) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6226 * 1e-6 = 6.226e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.23e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So maybe that's the correct option.

But wait, did I make any mistakes?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should include the contribution from H2PO4^- as well. Because HPO4^2- isn't the only source of PO4^3-; H2PO4^- can lose two protons to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but at pH 7.09, which is lower than pKa2 (7.2076), the H2PO4^- is more likely to stay as H2PO4^- than lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. Similarly, HPO4^2- would not lose another proton to become PO4^3- under conditions where pH is well below pKa3.

Wait, but let me think about the multiple steps. The PO4^3- can come from HPO4^2- losing a proton, which is the third dissociation step. Alternatively, H2PO4^- can lose two protons to become PO4^3-.

So, perhaps the total [PO4^3-] is the sum of the PO4^3- produced from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

So, I need to calculate both contributions.

But wait, is that necessary? Let me see.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-.

But considering that the pH is around 7.09, which is just below pKa2, the HPO4^2- is in the solution as a small amount. But the H2PO4^- can't lose a second proton because the pH is lower than pKa2. Wait, no, pH is lower than pKa2, so H2PO4^- is the predominant form, meaning that the second dissociation is not favored, so the HPO4^2- is a minor species.

Wait, but we already have HPO4^2- in solution from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, so it's not negligible. So, perhaps the [PO4^3-] comes from the HPO4^2- via the third dissociation.

But what about H2PO4^- losing two H+ to become PO4^3-? That would involve two dissociation steps. Let me think about that.

The overall reaction would be H2PO4^- → 2 H+ + PO4^3-.

The equilibrium expression for this would be:

Ka2 * Ka3 = [H+]^2 [PO4^3-] / [H2PO4^-]

Wait, yeah, because each dissociation step contributes. So, the combined dissociation would have an equilibrium constant of Ka2 * Ka3.

So, using this, the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.

Hmm, that's another way to calculate [PO4^3-], considering both dissociation steps.

Wait, but would that give a comparable or smaller value?

Let me compute that.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, Ka2*Ka3 = (6.2e-8)(1.8e-12) = 1.116e-19.

[H+] is 8.12e-8 M, so [H+]^2 = (8.12e-8)^2 ≈ 6.59e-15.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * [H2PO4^-]) / 6.59e-15.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

So, plugging in:

(1.116e-19 * 0.036715) / 6.59e-15.

Calculate numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.036715 ≈ 4.10e-21.

Denominator: 6.59e-15.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈ (4.10e-21)/(6.59e-15) ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Wait, that's the same as the previous result. Interesting.

So, whether I consider the contribution from HPO4^2- or from H2PO4^-, I end up with the same [PO4^3-], which is about 6.22e-7 M.

So, the answer would be approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

Wait a second, but why are both approaches giving the same result?

Because when I considered the HPO4^2- dissociation, I used [HPO4^2-] * (Ka3 / [H+]).

In the second approach, using H2PO4^-, I used [H2PO4^-] * (Ka2*Ka3)/( [H+]^2 ).

But looking at the numbers:

Option 1: [HPO4^2-] * (Ka3 / [H+]) = 0.028085 * (1.8e-12 / 8.12e-8) = 0.028085 * (2.216e-5) ≈ 6.22e-7.

Option 2: [H2PO4^-] * (Ka2*Ka3)/[H+]^2 = 0.036715 * (6.2e-8 *1.8e-12 )/( (8.12e-8)^2 )

Wait, let me re-calculate the Option 2.

Ka2*Ka3 = 6.2e-8 *1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19.

[H+]^2 = (8.12e-8)^2 ≈6.59e-15.

So, (Ka2*Ka3)/[H+]^2 = 1.116e-19 /6.59e-15 = 1.694e-5.

Multiply by [H2PO4^-] 0.036715:

0.036715 * 1.694e-5 = approx 6.18e-7.

Which is very close to the first approach's 6.22e-7.

So, in both cases, the [PO4^3-] is about 6.2e-7 M, which matches option A.

But wait, looking back, the options include option D: 3.97e-7. Why is that an option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the math again.

Wait, when I calculated [PO4^3-] from HPO4^2-, I found 6.22e-7 M, and from H2PO4^-, I found ~6.18e-7 M. So, the total would be about the same, around 6.2e-7.

Looking again, the options have A) 6.24e-7 and D) 3.97e-7.

I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation because the options don't have 6.2e-7 except A.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but I don't think that's required here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should not consider both sources, but only the direct one. Because HPO4^2- is already present, and H2PO4^- can only become HPO4^2- and then PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps when I calculated using HPO4^2-, I already included the contribution from H2PO4^- via the second dissociation. No, no. Because the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is a separate source. The H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4.

So, in reality, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present. Each can contribute to PO4^3- through their respective dissociation steps.

Wait, but when I calculated using the HPO4^2-, I accounted for their contribution. When I calculated using H2PO4^-, I accounted for their contribution. But perhaps the correct approach is to sum both contributions.

Wait, that makes sense. Because any HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-, and any H2PO4^- can lose two protons (but through two steps) to become PO4^3-.

So, the total [PO4^3-] would be the sum of [PO4^3-] from HPO4^2- and [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^-.

So, let me calculate both separately.

First, [PO4^3-] from HPO4^2-:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

As before, (1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ) / (8.12e-8 )=5.0553e-14 /8.12e-8=6.226e-7 M.

Second, [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^-:

The overall reaction is H2PO4^- → 2 H+ + PO4^3-.

The equilibrium constant for this is Ka2 * Ka3 = (6.2e-8)(1.8e-12)=1.116e-19.

Equilibrium expression: [PO4^3-][H+]^2 / [H2PO4^-] =1.116e-19.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.

[H+]=8.12e-8, [H2PO4^-]=0.036715.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * 0.036715 ) / ( (8.12e-8)^2 )

Calculate numerator: 1.116e-19 *0.036715 ≈4.10e-21.

Denominator: (8.12e-8)^2=6.59e-15.

So, [PO4^3-] =4.10e-21 /6.59e-15 ≈6.22e-7 M.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if I sum both contributions, I would get (6.22e-7 +6.22e-7)=1.24e-6 M, which is way higher than the options.

But that's not possible, because the PO4^3- concentration can't be higher than either of the parent species.

Ah, I see. I must have made a mistake here. Because the PO4^3- can't come from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- independently. The way I calculated it for H2PO4^- already includes the effect of the second deprotonation.

Wait, because the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which can then lose another to become PO4^3-. So, in reality, the total [PO4^3-] is the sum of the PO4^3- from both paths. But wait, no, because the HPO4^2- already includes the contribution from H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of charge balance.

The solution must satisfy the charge balance. The major cations are K+ and Na+, which are from the salts.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Let me approach it differently.

The phosphate species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

The majority are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they're the buffer components.

But the amount of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation step, regardless of which species it comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model all the possible species using the dissociation constants.

But that might get too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach, considering only HPO4^2- dissociating, gives the correct answer.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration is about 6.2e-7, which is option A.

But the options include a D option. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

HPO4^2- concentration: 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L =0.028085 M.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

pH=7.09 → [H+]=8.12e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.12e-8 )

= (5.055e-14) / (8.12e-8 )

= 6.227e-7.

So, about 6.23e-7 M, which is 6.23e-7. So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But why is there an option D with 3.97e-7? Maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution's solution includes contributions from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but I should model the total concentration using the third dissociation.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The correct approach is to consider that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation.

So, the correct calculation is 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles. Let me recheck.

KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007345 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005617 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005617 /0.2 = 0.028085 M.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Hmm. So the answer should be option A, but the initial thinking led me there. But why is option D present?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the pH calculation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([A2-]/[HA])

Where A2- is HPO4^2-, and HA is H2PO4^-.

pKa2=7.2076.

Ratio [A2-]/[HA] =0.028085 /0.036715≈0.765.

Log(0.765)= approx -0.115.

So, pH=7.2076 -0.115=7.0926, which is correct.

So, [H+]=10^-7.0926.

Let me compute 10^-7.0926 precisely.

Since 10^7.0926 = 10^7 * 10^0.0926.

10^0.0926 ≈1.236 (since 10^0.1≈1.258, but 0.0926 is a little less, so around 1.236).

So, 10^7.0926=1.236e7, so 10^-7.0926=1/(1.236e7)= approx 8.1e-8 M.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the [H+] is 8.1e-8 M.

So, when I compute [PO4^3-], it's (1.8e-12 * 0.028085)/8.1e-8= (5.055e-14)/(8.1e-8)=6.24e-7 M.

Which is option A.

But wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial assumption is that the solution's pH is 7.09, but perhaps I should adjust for activity coefficients or other factors. But since the problem doesn't mention that, I think it's safe to ignore.

So, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) at 25 °C. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
- **KH₂PO₄ dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻**:  
  Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into HPO₄²⁻**:  
  Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005617}{0.2} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208\).  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.028085}{0.036725}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 \approx 7.093
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]
The equilibrium constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).  
The relationship is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  
- Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0553 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
