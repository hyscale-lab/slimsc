Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors with complex numbers, right? Oh wait, maybe these are just real numbers for simplicity. I'll proceed with that assumption.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. So, matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Matrix Q has elements (1,0,0) in the first row, (0,0,0) in the second, and (0,0,-1) in the third.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We're to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Hmm, so in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, you get one of its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, this is only the case if the operator is measured. So, the measurement of P affects the state, and then Q is measured on this new state.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let's outline the steps.

First, I need to find the possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Then, when we measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, with this new state, we measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, wait. But wait, the initial state is given. So the first step is to express this initial state in terms of the eigenstates of P. Because when we measure P, the state will collapse into one of the eigenstates of P, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenstate in the current state.

But wait, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Let me structure this properly.

Step 1: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

Step 2: Express the initial state vector as a combination of the eigenvectors of P. The coefficients will give the probabilities when measuring P.

Step 3: The probability of getting eigenvalue 0 for P is the square of the modulus of the coefficient corresponding to that eigenvector in the initial state.

Step 4: Once P is measured as 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. Then, we need to compute the probability of measuring Q as -1 on this new state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a two-step process, but I might have to consider the state after the first measurement for the second.

But wait, let's start with step 1.

First, finding the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix, so it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Let me attempt to find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix (P - λI) is:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Calculating the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] + 0 * [...] 

Wait, maybe it's easier to expand along the first row.

So, determinant = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ] ] ) - (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0.

Calculating each minor:

First minor: det of the 2x2 matrix. (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 = λ² - (1/2)

Second minor: the 2x2 matrix is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2); 0, -λ]. The determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ/sqrt(2)

So putting it together:

det = -λ [λ² - 1/2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -λ/sqrt(2) ) 

Simplify:

= -λ³ + (λ/2) ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ/sqrt(2)) )

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ (1/2) )

Because (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2))= 1/2.

So the terms are (-λ³) + (λ/2) + (λ/2) ) = -λ³ + λ.

Set determinant to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(-λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ(1 - λ²) =0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ= -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but wait, when I expand the determinant, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]

[d e f]

[g h i]

So for our matrix:

a= -λ, b=1/sqrt(2), c=0

d=1/sqrt(2), e= -λ, f=1/sqrt(2)

g=0, h=1/sqrt(2), i= -λ

So determinant = a*(e i - f h) - b*(d i - f g) + c*(d h - e g)

Compute each part:

a*(e i - f h) → (-λ) [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] → (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

- b*(d i - f g) → -(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] → -(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ/sqrt(2)) ] → -(1/sqrt(2))*(-λ/sqrt(2)) → (λ)/(2)

+ c*(d h - e g) → 0 * [ ... ] → 0

So overall determinant → (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) 

Which is -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) → -λ³ + λ.

So yes, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So for P, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Similarly, for each eigenvalue, we can find the eigenvectors.

Let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

First, for λ=0:

We need to solve (P - 0I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → equation: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) → (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 =0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0. Then from row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are [v1, 0, v3] where v1 = -v3.

We can write the eigenvector as any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). Because v1 = -v3, setting v3 =1, v1=-1.

So, normalized, what's the eigenvector? Wait, the state might not be normalized, but for the purposes of finding the projection, perhaps it's okay.

Wait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me think: So, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0,1,-1.

But in this problem, we're looking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, I need to compute the probability of getting 0 for P, then, given that, compute the probability of -1 for Q.

But to find the initial probability, I need the initial state expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P.

Wait, but the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me see if I can express this as a combination of the eigenvectors of P.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvectors of P.

Because the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The eigenvector for P=0 is (1,0,-1), but perhaps not normalized. Let me compute the normalized eigenvector.

The vector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, we need to find the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1.

Let's proceed.

For λ=1:

Solve (P - I) v = 0.

Matrix P-I:

Row1: -1, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row2: 1/sqrt(2), -1, 1/sqrt(2)

Row3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -1.

Let me write the equations:

- v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Row2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 - v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Substituting v1 from row1: (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Which is (1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → (-1/2 v2) + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Row3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 - v3 =0 → v3 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

So substituting v3 into row2 equation:

- (1/2) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2) v2 ) =0 → - (1/2) v2 + (1/2) v2 =0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent. Let me express the variables in terms of v2.

v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

v3 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

So the eigenvector is [ (1/sqrt(2)), 1, (1/sqrt(2)) ] scaled by v2. Let's choose v2=1 for simplicity, so the vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, when λ=1:

The equations from row1: v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

From row3: v3 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

So the vector is ( (1/sqrt(2)) v2, v2, (1/sqrt(2)) v2 ).

Choosing v2= sqrt(2), then the vector is (1, sqrt(2), 1).

But to normalize it, let's compute the norm.

The vector (1, sqrt(2), 1) has components squared: 1 + 2 +1 =4. So the norm is 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

Wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the eigenvector.

Wait, when v2 is 1, the vector is (1/sqrt(2),1,1/sqrt(2)).

The norm squared is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) )= 1/2 +1 +1/2 = 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2))? No, wait:

Wait, [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)] has elements 1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2). Squared, each term is 1/2, 1, 1/2. Sum is 2.

So to normalize, divide by sqrt(2):

So |v1> = (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2) ) ?

Wait, 1/sqrt(2) divided by sqrt(2) is (1/sqrt(2)) / (sqrt(2)) ) = 1/(2). Similarly, 1/sqrt(2) is the middle term. Wait, no: the initial vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)), and to normalize, we divide each component by sqrt(2). So each component:

(1/sqrt(2))/sqrt(2) = 1/(2), 

1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2 ).

Wait, no, wait: 1/sqrt(2) divided by sqrt(2) is 1/(2). And 1 divided by sqrt(2) is sqrt(2)/2.

So |v1> is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

Wait, that seems correct.

Similarly, for λ=-1, let's find the eigenvector.

Solve (P + I) v =0.

Matrix P + I:

Row1: 1, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row2: 1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)

Row3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 1.

Set up equations.

Row1: v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v1 = - (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Row2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Substitute v1 from row1: (1/sqrt(2)) (-1/sqrt(2) v2 ) + v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → (-1/2 v2 ) + v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → (1/2 v2) + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Row3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + v3 =0 → v3 = - (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Substitute v3 into row2 equation: (1/2) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) (-1/sqrt(2) v2 ) =0 → (1/2) v2 - (1/2) v2 =0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent. Thus, we can express v1 and v3 in terms of v2.

v1 = - (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

v3 = - (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

So the eigenvector is [ -1/sqrt(2) v2, v2, -1/sqrt(2) v2 ].

Choosing v2 =1, the vector is (-1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2)).

The norm is sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (-1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the components after normalization:

Each component of the eigenvector is (-1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2)).

Divide by sqrt(2): [ (-1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2) ) ].

Wait: -1/sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) = -1/(2), same with the third component.

So |v-1> is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the initial vector for λ=-1 is (-1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2)). The norm squared is (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= 2. So norm is sqrt(2). So normalization is dividing each component by sqrt(2).

So each component becomes (-1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2)).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write the three eigenvectors:

|v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) → for P=0.

|v1> = (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2) → for P=1.

|v-1> = (-1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2) → for P=-1.

Wait, wait. Let me check that.

Wait, the eigenvector for P=-1 was found as [ -1/sqrt(2),1, -1/sqrt(2) ], but when normalized, each component is divided by sqrt(2). So:

-1/sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) = (-1)/(2) 

1 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, -1/sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) = -1/2.

So the normalized vector is [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ].

But wait, wait, the middle term in the eigenvector for λ=-1 is 1, right? Because earlier, when I set v2=1, the vector is (-1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2)).

So when v2=1, the vector is (-1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2)).

So, when normalized, each component is divided by sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= sqrt(2).

So each component becomes:

-1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))= -1/2,

1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2,

-1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))= -1/2.

So yes, the normalized eigenvector is [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ].

Wait, but wait, the middle term was 1, so when divided by sqrt(2), it's 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

We can express |ψ> as a linear combination of |v0>, |v1>, and |v-1>.

That is, |ψ> = a |v0> + b |v1> + c |v-1>.

The coefficients a, b, c are the projections of |ψ> onto each eigenvector.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure that the eigenvectors are orthonormal. Because if they are, the coefficients can be found by taking inner products.

So, let's check orthonormality.

|v0> ⋅ |v1> : (1/sqrt(2))(1/2) + 0*(sqrt(2)/2) + (-1/sqrt(2))(1/2) → (1/(2sqrt(2))) + 0 + (-1/(2sqrt(2))) = 0.

Similarly, |v0> ⋅ |v-1> : (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/2) + 0*(sqrt(2)/2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1/2) → (-1/(2sqrt(2))) + 0 + (1/(2sqrt(2))) = 0.

|v1> ⋅ |v-1> : (1/2)(-1/2) + (sqrt(2)/2)(sqrt(2)/2) + (1/2)(-1/2) → (-1/4) + (2/4) + (-1/4) → (−1 +2 −1)/4 = 0.

So yes, they are orthonormal.

Thus, the coefficients a, b, c are given by:

a = <v0 | ψ>,

b = <v1 | ψ>,

c = <v-1 | ψ>.

Compute each:

a = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 → (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) → (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait. Because |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). So:

a = [1/sqrt(2)]*(-1) + 0*2 + [ -1/sqrt(2) ]*1 → (-1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2)/sqrt(2) → which is -sqrt(2).

Similarly, b = <v1 | ψ> = (1/2)*(-1) + (sqrt(2)/2)*2 + (1/2)*1.

Compute each term:

(1/2)*(-1) = -1/2,

(sqrt(2)/2)*2 = sqrt(2),

(1/2)*1 = 1/2.

Sum: (-1/2) + sqrt(2) + (1/2) = sqrt(2). So b = sqrt(2).

c = <v-1 | ψ> = (-1/2)*(-1) + (sqrt(2)/2)*2 + (-1/2)* (1).

Compute each term:

(-1/2)*(-1) = 1/2,

(sqrt(2)/2)*2 = sqrt(2),

(-1/2)*1 = -1/2.

Sum: 1/2 + sqrt(2) - 1/2 = sqrt(2).

So, a = -sqrt(2), b= sqrt(2), c= sqrt(2).

But wait, the initial state is |ψ> = a |v0> + b |v1> + c |v-1>.

So to find the probability of measuring P=0, we take |a|^2.

a is -sqrt(2), so |a|^2 is ( sqrt(2) )^2 = 2.

But wait, the state |ψ> must have a norm squared equal to the sum of the squares of the coefficients, which is |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2.

Compute:

|a|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2,

|b|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2,

|c|² = (sqrt(2))²=2.

Total: 2+2+2=6. So the norm is 6, which suggests that the initial state is not normalized.

Wait, because the state is given as (-1,2,1), let's compute its norm.

sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1 +4 +1 )= sqrt(6).

So the state is not normalized; it's a vector of length sqrt(6).

So, to correctly find the probabilities, we should normalize |ψ> first.

Wait, that's an important point.

So, the given state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2,1 ]^T, with norm sqrt(6).

So, the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Then, the coefficients a, b, c are computed as:

a = <v0 | ψ_normalized>,

b = <v1 | ψ_normalized>,

c = <v-1 | ψ_normalized>.

Wait, because when computing probabilities, the state must be normalized.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier by not normalizing the initial state.

Let me correct that.

So, |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Now, compute a = <v0 | ψ_normalized>:

v0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So a = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So a = (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3))= (-1)/sqrt(3).

Similarly, compute b = <v1 | ψ_normalized>.

v1 is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

So <v1 | ψ> = (1/2)*(-1/sqrt(6)) + (sqrt(2)/2)*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/2)*(1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

(1/2)(-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(2 sqrt(6)),

(sqrt(2)/2)(2/sqrt(6))= (sqrt(2)*2)/(2 sqrt(6)) )= sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) )= sqrt(2)/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) ))= 1/sqrt(3),

(1/2)(1/sqrt(6))= 1/(2 sqrt(6)).

So sum: (-1/(2 sqrt(6))) + (1/sqrt(3)) + (1/(2 sqrt(6))).

The first and third terms cancel: (-1/(2 sqrt(6)) +1/(2 sqrt(6))) =0.

So b= 1/sqrt(3).

Similarly, compute c = <v-1 | ψ_normalized>.

v-1 is ( -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ).

So <v-1 | ψ> = (-1/2)*(-1/sqrt(6)) + (sqrt(2)/2)*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/2)*(1/sqrt(6)).

Each term:

(-1/2)(-1/sqrt(6)) = 1/(2 sqrt(6)),

(sqrt(2)/2)(2/sqrt(6))= (sqrt(2)*2)/(2 sqrt(6)) )= sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) )= 1/sqrt(3),

(-1/2)(1/sqrt(6))= -1/(2 sqrt(6)).

So sum: 1/(2 sqrt(6)) + 1/sqrt(3) - 1/(2 sqrt(6)).

First and third terms cancel again. So c= 1/sqrt(3).

So now, the coefficients are:

a = -1/sqrt(3),

b = 1/sqrt(3),

c=1/sqrt(3).

The probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

Compute |a|² = (1/sqrt(3))²= 1/3,

|b|²=1/3,

|c|²=1/3.

So each eigenvalue 0,1,-1 has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, that's interesting. So the initial state, when measured for P, has a 1/3 chance of each outcome: 0,1,-1.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

But the question is about the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1. So, given that P is measured as 0, the state collapses to |v0>, which is the eigenvector for P=0.

Now, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting Q=-1.

So, the state after P=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, operator Q is given by the matrix:

[1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 -1 ]

So, Q is a diagonal matrix, which makes things easier because its eigenvalues are 1 (with eigenvector (1,0,0)), 0 (eigenspace includes (0, y, 0) for any y), and -1 (eigenvector (0,0,1)).

So, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1.

We need to find the probability that Q=-1 when the state is |v0>.

So, first, express |v0> in the eigenbasis of Q.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value or the probabilities directly.

Alternatively, perhaps Q acts on |v0> as follows.

|v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Applying Q to |v0>:

Q |v0> = [1*(1/sqrt(2)), 0, (-1)*(-1/sqrt(2)) ].

Wait, no. Wait, Q is diagonal, so each component is multiplied by the diagonal element.

Wait, no, the matrix Q is diagonal, so Q |v0> = [ (1)(1/sqrt(2)), 0, (-1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) ] → [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ) ].

Wait, wait, no. The third component of |v0> is -1/sqrt(2), and the third diagonal element is -1.

So Q |v0> = [1*(1/sqrt(2)), 0, (-1)*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) ].

Wait, that would give [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].

But wait, that's not an eigenvector, because Q |v0> isn't a scalar multiple of |v0>.

Wait, but |v0> is an eigenvector of P, not of Q. So when we measure Q on |v0>, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvectors.

So, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are:

For Q=1: (1,0,0),

For Q=0: any vector in the y-z plane with x=0,

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix Q is diagonal with 1,0,-1 on the diagonal. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So, the eigenvectors are:

|e1> = (1,0,0) → eigenvalue 1,

|e2> = (0,1,0) → eigenvalue 0,

|e3> = (0,0,1) → eigenvalue -1.

So, to find the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the state is |v0>, we compute the projection of |v0> onto |e3>.

The projection amplitude is <e3 | v0>.

Which is the third component of |v0>.

So, |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The third component is -1/sqrt(2).

So the probability is | -1/sqrt(2) |² = (1/2).

So the probability is 1/2.

Wait, but wait: the state after P=0 is |v0> which is (1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)).

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is (0,0,1).

The inner product between |v0> and |e3> is (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(2).

So the probability is | -1/sqrt(2) |² = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0 (which is 1/2).

Wait, no. Because the outcomes are sequential. So, the total probability is P(P=0) multiplied by P(Q=-1 | P=0).

Which is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait, what about the state after P=0? It's |v0>, which is an eigenvector of P. But when measuring Q on that state, the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2, as computed.

So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

To solve the problem, we analyze the quantum system step-by-step:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Operator \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:
- For \( \lambda = 0 \):  
  \[
  |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\ 0 \\ -1
  \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
- For \( \lambda = 1 \):  
  \[
  |v_1\rangle = \frac{1}{2} 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1
  \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
- For \( \lambda = -1 \):  
  \[
  |v_{-1}\rangle = \frac{1}{2} 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1
  \end{bmatrix}.
  \]

### Step 2: Express the Initial State in Terms of Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The initial state is given as \( |\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]  
This state is not normalized. Its norm is \( \|\psi\| = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:
\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The coefficients of \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( P \) are calculated as:
- \( a = \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \),
- \( b = \langle v_1 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \),
- \( c = \langle v_{-1} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \).

The probabilities of measuring \( P = 0, 1, -1 \) are the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(P=0) = |a|^2 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(P=1) = |b|^2 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(P=-1) = |c|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \) After \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:
\[
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding normalized eigenvectors:
- For \( Q = 1 \): \( |e_1\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]
- For \( Q = 0 \): \( |e_2\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 1 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]
- For \( Q = -1 \): \( |e_{-1}\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\) The probability of subsequently measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( |v_0\rangle \) onto \( |e_{-1}\rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \langle e_{-1} | v_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Combined Probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
