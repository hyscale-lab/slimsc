Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The NMR data is given: the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The products' NOESY NMR shows a cross-peak in the major but not in the minor.

I need to find which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product's 1H NMR.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, the starting material: a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. So, the structure of the anhydride is probably a cyclic anhydride because when dicarboxylic acids lose water, they form cyclic anhydrides, especially if they're conjugated.

The NMR of the anhydride: 1H has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably aromatic protons. Wait, but 7 ppm can also be from carbonyl adjacent protons, but in an anhydride, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about typical 13C shifts. 165 ppm is probably an oxygenated carbon, like a carbonyl (maybe an anhydride carbonyl). 137 ppm is around where sp² carbons are, perhaps in a double bond. So the anhydride might have a double bond because the starting material had a cis-alkene.

So, the anhydride has a ring structure, perhaps a six-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic anhydride, with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows only a single peak at 7 ppm. So if the anhydride has aromatic protons, but the starting acid was a dicarboxylic acid, perhaps the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride with conjugated double bonds, but without any protons attached. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has an aromatic ring, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride might have an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That could explain the 137 ppm (the sp² carbon next to carbonyl) and the 165 ppm (carbonyl). The single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR might be from the vinylic protons.

Wait, an alpha,beta-unsaturated anhydride would have vinylic protons. But if the starting material is a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a trans-alkene in the anhydride? Or maybe the same configuration? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a conjugated diene, but that might complicate things.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests all the protons in that environment are equivalent. So maybe it's a pair of protons that are deshielded and equivalent, like a trans double bond.

Wait, let me think. If the anhydride has a structure like:

O=C-O-C-O=C
But that's a simple cyclic anhydride, but without any double bonds. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's a maleic anhydride type structure, which is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. The structure would be a five-membered ring with an oxygen and a double bond.

Wait, maleic anhydride is a good example. Its structure is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond between the two carbonyls. The 1H NMR of maleic anhydride actually doesn't have any protons because the double bond is between two carbonyl groups. So where are the protons?

Wait, if the starting acid was a diacid with a cis-alkene, perhaps the anhydride is formed by losing a water from the diacid. So, the diacid would have the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. Wait, no, wait: the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH become HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's without a double bond. Wait, maybe the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, but that would be a four-carbon diacid with a double bond. So, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH upon dehydration. No, wait, the dehydration of a diacid would form an anhydride, so the structure would be a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, for example, if the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, but where would the double bond come into play? Maybe the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → when dehydrated, becomes a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → when dehydrated, forms an anhydride. But if the original had a cis-alkene, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double between the CH₂ groups, like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → upon dehydration, becomes a cyclic anhydride with a double bond, possibly a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is a five-membered ring, where the oxygen is part of the ring, and the double bond is between two carbons adjacent to the carbonyls. So, in the anhydride, the structure would be O=C-O-C-O=C, but with a double bond in the ring. So that would make it something like a cyclic structure with an ester-like linkage and a double bond.

Wait, so the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is probably a carbonyl carbon (anhydride carbonyl), and 137 is a sp² carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, maybe the anhydride has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So the structure is similar to maleic anhydride, which is a cyclo-o-structure with a double bond.

In maleic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond. The protons are on the double bond, but in maleic anhydride, the double bond is between two carbons that are each connected to an oxygen. So the protons would be on the double bond, but in that case, the 1H NMR would have a peak for those protons. However, in maleic anhydride, the double bond is between two carbonyl groups, so there are no hydrogens because each carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and another carbon. So in that case, the 1H NMR would have no peaks from the double bond. Hmm, but the question says the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which might be from some protons elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride has another double bond elsewhere, not part of the ring. Or maybe the diacid is not just a simple four-carbon, but longer. Suppose the diacid is HOOC-(CH₂)n-CH₂-COOH with a cis double bond. Dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond.

But in any case, let me think about the reaction between the anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene. So, the reaction is likely a Diels-Alder reaction between the anhydride's dienophile and the cyclopentadiene as the diene.

Wait, the dienophile would be the anhydride, which is an electron-deficient dienophile, like maleic anhydride. The diene is the cyclopentadiene.

So the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring with substituents from the dienophile and diene.

The product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps, and the adduct would have substituents from the diene.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the diene is a cyclopentadiene substituted with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So, when it reacts in a Diels-Alder reaction, the endo rule might be in play, leading to the major product.

So, the Diels-Alder adduct would have two new sigma bonds formed between the diene and the dienophile. The product would have the substituents from the diene (the four methyl groups) and the substituents from the dienophile (the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride).

Wait, but the anhydride is a dienophile. So the reaction would form an adduct where the anhydride becomes part of a six-membered ring, and the cyclopentadiene becomes part of the same ring.

The molecular formula of both products is C13H16O3. Let me calculate the molecular formulas.

The anhydride would come from a diacid. Let's assume the diacid is something like HOOC-(CH₂)2-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle. Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. Wait, but that's four carbons. Dehydration would form a five-membered cyclic anhydride, which would be a five-membered ring (O=C-O-C-O=C), but that's four carbons in the ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, that's a five-carbon diacid, but with a double bond somewhere. Maybe the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a cis double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → when dehydrated, becomes a cyclic anhydride with the double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → dehydration gives a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe the anhydride has some aromatic protons. But that seems unlikely because anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids are typically not aromatic. Alternatively, the 7 ppm peak could be from vinylic protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, if the anhydride is a substituted maleic anhydride, like with some substituents, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is a substituted compound. But maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the Diels-Alder adduct. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene with four methyl groups.

So when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (cyclopentadiene) would attack the dienophile (the anhydride). The product would have a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

The substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) would be two carbonyl groups attached to the ring. The substituents from the diene would be the four methyl groups.

So the product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps with the four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentane ring that's part of the Diels-Alder adduct.

But wait, the molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let me compute.

The dienophile (anhydride) would have molecular formula CnH2nO3? Wait, no. Let's think: the diacid is CnH2n-2O4, since it's HOOC-(CH2)m-COOH, so for each COOH group, we have two oxygens. So the diacid would have the formula HOOC-(CH2)m-COOH, which is C(m+2)H(2m+2)O4.

When dehydrated to form the anhydride, it would lose H2O, so the anhydride would be (m+2) carbons, formula C(m+2)H(2m)O3.

Then, the dienophile is that anhydride, and the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The structure of the diene is cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups.

The molecular formula of the diene: cyclopentadiene is C5H6, and with four methyl groups (each -CH3), it becomes C5 + 4*(C1) = C9, and H: 6 + 4*3 = 18 → so the diene is C9H18?

Wait, no. Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The parent structure is cyclopentadiene: C5H6. Each substituent is a methyl group.

Each methyl adds one carbon and three hydrogens. Four methyl groups add 4*(CH3), so total carbons: 5 + 4 = 9. Hydrogens: 6 + 4*3 = 18. So the diene is C9H18.

Wait, but wait: the cyclopentadiene is 1,3-diene. So, when it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions. But if the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, then it's actually a conjugated diene. But with methyl groups at 1,2,3,4 positions. So each of those positions (atoms 1,2,3,4) has a methyl group.

So, molecular formula: C9H14? Wait, wait, let me recalculate. The cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Each methyl group is -CH3, which adds 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens. So four methyl groups add 4 carbons (5+4=9 C) and 12 H (since 4*3=12). The diene without substituents has 6 H. Adding 12 gives 18 H. So formula is C9H18.

Wait, but the molecular formula of the adduct is C13H16O3. The dienophile (anhydride) is, as I thought, CnH2nO3. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Original diacid is HOOC-(CH2)m-COOH, which is C(m+2)H(2m+2)O4. When it loses H2O to form the anhydride, formula becomes C(m+2)H(2m)O3.

So, if m is 2, then the diacid is C4H6O4. Anhydride would be C4H4O3.

Then, the dienophile is C4H4O3.

The diene is C9H18.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (4 π electrons) and dienophile (2 π electrons) combine, so the product's molecular formula is (C4H4O3) + (C9H18) → C13H22O3. But the product is C13H16O3. So that suggests loss of four hydrogens, which would mean two rings are formed, perhaps, or some other loss.

Wait, but the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring and typically involves two new sigma bonds, with four hydrogens lost (because the diene has four H's in the double bonds, and the dienophile has none). Wait, the dienophile (anhydride) is an electron-deficient species, so it doesn't have hydrogens on the double bond. So the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with substituents. The molecular formula should be (C4H4O3) + (C9H18) = C13H22O3. But the product is C13H16O3. So that's a loss of 6 H. Wait, maybe I missed some steps.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is part of a ring and when it reacts, some rings are formed. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a cyclic diene, so the product includes the ring from the diene and forms another ring from the Diels-Alder reaction, leading to a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is not the cyclic anhydride but a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is a different part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is the dienophile, and when it reacts with the diene, the product is a six-membered ring with substituents from both. The substituents would include the four methyl groups from the diene and the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the products.

The reaction produces two products, major and minor. The molecular formula is C13H16O3. So the product's molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let's calculate the possible rings and double bonds.

The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated. For C13H16O3: each degree is a ring or double bond.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*13 +2 -16)/2= (28-16)/2=6. So six degrees: could be three rings and no double bonds, or a combination.

But the starting materials (anhydride and cyclopentadiene) have some double bonds. The Diels-Alder product typically has a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds and a conjugated diene converted into a single bond. So the product would have two rings (from the cyclopentadiene and the new six-membered ring) and perhaps some double bonds.

Wait, but for the molecular formula, let's think of the product as derived from the Diels-Alder reaction.

The diene (C9H18) plus dienophile (C4H4O3) would form C13H22O3. But the product is C13H16O3, so loss of 6 H. That suggests two rings are formed (each ring loses two H) and perhaps a double bond remains.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic structure with two rings, and an exo double bond.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible structures.

The major and minor products result from different stereochemical outcomes of the Diels-Alder reaction. The diene is symmetric, perhaps, leading to different diastereomers.

Wait, but the problem is about the NOESY NMR. A cross-peak in the major product but not the minor. NOESY detects through-space proximity, so if two protons are close in space (i.e., in a certain conformation), they will show a cross-peak.

In the major product, the cross-peak is present between two specific protons. The options give different possibilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So, the cross-peak connects these two sets of protons.

In the major product, perhaps the protons are in a certain configuration where they are close in space, leading to a cross-peak.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would place substituents on the same face. So, the endo transition state leads to the major product, which has substituents on the same face.

In the major product, perhaps the protons from the dienophile (anhydride) are on the same face as the protons from the diene, leading them to be close in space.

Alternatively, the cross-peak connects a set of protons that are on adjacent carbons in a ring, or perhaps in a substituent that is in close proximity due to the ring structure.

Looking at the options, the 6H singlet at ~1 ppm could be from methyl groups attached to something, perhaps the cyclopentane ring. The 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm could be a CH2 or CH group adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be on the six-membered ring as endo substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure where the substituents from the dienophile are in a certain position relative to the substituents from the diene.

Wait, another approach: the NOESY cross-peak in the major product indicates that two protons are close in space, which occurs when they are on adjacent carbons (vicinal) and in a certain conformation.

So, for example, in a chair conformation, axial protons can be close to equatorial protons on adjacent carbons.

But the product here is probably a bicyclic structure, so the arrangement of substituents would influence which protons are near each other.

The dicarboxylic anhydride after Diels-Alder would have the two carbonyl groups as substituents on the six-membered ring. The diene's substituents (four methyl groups) would be on the adjacent positions.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure where the two carbonyl groups are in a certain position, and the methyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons.

If the major product has a certain conformation, like a chair, the protons on the oxygen-bearing carbons could be in proximity to protons on adjacent carbons.

But perhaps it's easier to think of the coupling in the product. Let's consider the possible NMR signals.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. Six hydrogens each as singlets. That could be two sets of methyl groups. Maybe two methyl groups each with three H, but as singlets they must be in a symmetric environment.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the four methyl groups from the diene might be split into two sets. Because the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, when it reacts, the substituents would be in positions 1,2,3,4 of the cyclopentane ring.

Wait, but in the adduct, the substituents would be on the six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentane ring becomes part of a bicyclic structure, with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the four methyl groups from the diene are in positions that make two sets of equivalent protons. For example, two methyl groups on one face and two on the other.

Wait, but in the major product, perhaps the endo transition state leads to a specific arrangement where some methyl groups are on the same side, leading to a singlet.

Wait, perhaps the four methyl groups are in such a symmetric position that their protons are split into two sets of singlets. Like two methyl groups each giving a singlet at 1 ppm and another two at 1.7 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the six hydrogens at ~1 ppm are from the diene's substituents, and the six at ~1.7 are from the dienophile's substituents, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the six H singlet at ~1 ppm is from the methyl groups attached to the cyclopentane ring, and the six H at ~1.7 ppm are from the endo substituents from the anhydride.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options again.

The cross-peak in the major product connects two groups of protons. The options suggest either different types of protons or the same type.

Option C connects two singlets, each 6H. That might suggest that both are methyl groups. For example, two separate sets of methyl groups that are in close proximity.

But in the product, the four methyl groups from the diene would be in specific positions. If two are on adjacent carbons and in a certain conformation, their protons could be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Wait, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which suggests that in the cyclopentane ring, each of the four adjacent positions has a methyl group. So when the Diels-Alder happens, the substituents would be arranged in a certain way.

In the adduct, perhaps the four methyl groups are in such a position that two of them are adjacent and their protons are close in space, leading to a NOESY cross-peak.

Wait, but with four methyl groups, perhaps two are on one side and two on the other. But that may not lead to a cross-peak unless their protons are close.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two sets of equivalent methyl groups. For example, two methyl groups on the same carbon (but that's not the case as it's tetramethyl on four adjacent carbons).

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two substituents from the anhydride, each with three equivalent protons, but that's not the case as the anhydride doesn't have protons attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's the substituents from the diene. The four methyl groups on the cyclopentane ring. If the ring is in a certain conformation, some of the methyl groups' protons could be close.

Wait, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, so when it reacts, the substituents would be at positions 1,2,3,4 of the cyclopentane ring. In the Diels-Alder adduct, the ring would be fused with the six-membered ring.

So, the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be at positions adjacent to each other on the cyclopentane ring.

In the major product, perhaps two of the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons in such a way that their protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak.

If the four methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,4 on the cyclopentane ring, then in the bicyclic structure, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the methyl groups at 1 and 2 would be on adjacent carbons, and their protons could be close.

But wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents are in a certain arrangement. So perhaps in the major product, the two methyl groups (say, at positions 1 and 2) are in proximity.

So, each methyl group has three equivalent protons (as they're in the same environment), leading to a singlet. So, the cross-peak would be between a proton from the methyl group at 1 and a proton from the methyl group at 2.

But wait, each methyl group has three H. So, in the NOESY, any H from methyl 1 would show a cross-peak with any H from methyl 2 if they are close in space.

So, in the major product, which has a particular conformation, these protons are close, but in the minor product, they are not.

Looking at the options, the cross-peak in the major product is between two groups. Let me see which option connects a group that's a singlet and another that's a singlet or a doublet.

Option C: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. So, two methyl groups, each with six H? Wait, but 6H would be two methyl groups (each 3H) added together. So, perhaps it's two separate singlets.

Wait, but in the product, the four methyl groups would account for 4*(3H) =12 H. So, how does that fit into the options?

The product's formula is C13H16O3. So, 16 H in total. Let's see:

The Diels-Alder product would have four CH2 groups from the diene and dienophile, but perhaps in a bridged structure.

Alternatively, the four methyl groups (from the diene) contribute 12 H. So, the remaining 4 H would be from the rest of the structure.

But the options refer to groups of H, like 6H, which suggests that H are split into singlets due to symmetry.

So, if the product has two sets of equivalent methyl groups: perhaps two methyl groups are equivalent and another two are as well. Each set would contribute 6 H (2 groups *3 H each).

So, option C connects a 6H singlet at 1 ppm and a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm.

This would happen if the product has two separate environments for the methyl groups, each with two groups of three H, giving two singlets. So, perhaps due to the symmetry, the methyl groups are in two different environments.

But why would the cross-peak exist between 1 ppm and 1.7 ppm? If the two sets of methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, their protons would be close in space, leading to a cross-peak.

In the major product, which follows the endo rule, the substituents would be arranged in a way that brings these methyl groups close. So, their protons would be adjacent and show a cross-peak.

In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are arranged differently, making the methyl groups not as close, so the cross-peak is weak or absent.

So, the cross-peak in the major product would connect the two sets of methyl groups (each a singlet) at 1 ppm and 1.7 ppm. That would correspond to option C.

Alternatively, could it be option B? Option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

But 6H as a singlet would imply two methyl groups, and 2H as a singlet could be a CH2 group. But why would a CH2 and two methyls be close?

Alternatively, the 2H at 3.5 ppm could be from an oxygen-bearing CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl.

In the adduct, the oxygen from the anhydride would be part of the ring, perhaps as two ketone groups or ester groups.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder adduct, the anhydride's carbonyl groups would become part of the six-membered ring as ketones or esters.

Wait, the anhydride is O=C-O-C-O=C. So, after Diels-Alder, the structure would have two ester or ketone groups attached.

Wait, but in the adduct, the oxygen from the anhydride would form ester groups, perhaps. So, the product would have two ester groups attached to the six-membered ring.

So, perhaps the two carbonyls from the anhydride become ester groups in the adduct, which would be part of the ring.

In the adduct, the substituents on the ring would be the two ester groups and the four methyl groups from the diene.

So, in the major product, the substituents would be arranged in an endo fashion, which brings the substituents closer to the center.

So, the four methyl groups would be on adjacent carbons of the cyclopentane ring. The two ester groups would be on the six-membered ring.

The NOESY cross-peak would be between two protons that are in close proximity due to the ring's conformation.

If the product has two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, their protons would be close. But in the options, the cross-peak connects which protons?

Looking back, option C connects two singlets (6H each), which would correspond to two methyl groups. So, perhaps in the major product, two methyl groups are in a close arrangement, leading their protons to be close, thus showing a cross-peak.

In the minor product, perhaps the conformer is such that the methyl groups are not as close, so no cross-peak.

So, the correct answer would be option C: a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form a cyclic anhydride. This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The key distinction between the products lies in their NOESY NMR spectra, where a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. The task is to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is formed by dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Its ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, likely due to vinylic protons, and its ¹³C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, consistent with sp² carbons (likely from a double bond) and a carbonyl group, respectively.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride acts as the dienophile, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. The reaction forms a bicyclic product with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The major product follows the endo rule, where substituents are positioned on the same face of the six-membered ring, leading to specific spatial arrangements of protons.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   NOESY detects through-space proximity between protons. In the major product, the cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are spatially close due to the product's conformation. This is likely due to the proximity of methyl groups from the diene in the bicyclic structure.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H singlet could correspond to an oxygen-bearing CH₂ group, but this does not explain the proximity required for a strong cross-peak.  
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two sets of methyl groups, each contributing 6H (two methyl groups per set). In the major product, these methyl groups are in close proximity due to the bicyclic structure and endo arrangement, leading to a strong cross-peak.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product connects two sets of methyl groups, each contributing 6H, as indicated by the 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. This is consistent with the spatial arrangement of protons in the bicyclic structure formed via the Diels-Alder reaction.
