Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we're asked to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the state |alpha> is given up to a proportionality constant. So I need to normalize it because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes. The normalization is important because probabilities must sum to 1.

So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor. The squared magnitude of each coefficient will contribute to the normalization.

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So adding these, 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Thus, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, no, wait. Because the original statement says it's proportional, so we can write |alpha> = C*(1+i)|up> + C*(2-i)|down>, where C is a normalization constant. Wait, no, that's not right. The state is proportional, so the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), but it's not normalized yet. So I should compute the norm as |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Which is (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + (4+1)= 2+5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So the state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7) and b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix is A_ij. So the matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal basis states, the operator A has a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the indices are i and j—so for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:

A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1), A_12 = hbar/2 (i=1, j=2), A_21 = hbar/2 (i=2, j=1), and A_22 =0. So the matrix looks like:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. It resembles the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1], [1 0]], so A = (hbar/2) * X.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are usually defined with sigma_x, sigma_y, etc. So, the operator in question is A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But wait, in the problem statement, the operator is defined with A_ij = 0 when i=j and hbar/2 otherwise. So yes, that's correct. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. Because any scalar multiple of a matrix has the same eigenvectors.

So the eigenstates of A will be the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the superposition states |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are such that sigma_x |+x> = |+x> and similarly for |-x>. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |-x>), and then the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

So I need to compute the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors of the operator A and express |alpha> in that basis.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, maybe we can compute the probabilities by using the matrix elements and the state vector.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, let me write |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Then, the state |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

To find c1 and c2, I can compute the inner products < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

So, let's compute c1 = < +x | alpha >.

c1 = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) * |alpha> 

= [ (alpha_up)* + (alpha_down)* ] / sqrt(2)

Where alpha_up is the coefficient of |up> in |alpha>, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and alpha_down is (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c1 = [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^* + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )^* ] / sqrt(2)

Compute the complex conjugates:

(1+i)* = 1 - i

(2 - i)* = 2 + i

So,

c1 = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

Combine terms:

(1 - i + 2 + i) / sqrt(7) = (3 + 0i) / sqrt(7) = 3/sqrt(7)

So,

c1 = (3/sqrt(7)) / sqrt(2) = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14))

Similarly, c2 = < -x | alpha >.

Which is [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2) acting on |alpha>

So,

c2 = [ alpha_up* - alpha_down* ] / sqrt(2)

Substituting:

alpha_up* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7)

alpha_down* = (2 + i)/sqrt(7)

So,

c2 = [ (1 - i) - (2 + i) ] / sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator:

(1 -i) - (2 + i) = 1 - i -2 -i = (1-2) + (-i -i) ) = -1 - 2i

So,

c2 = ( (-1 -2i ) / sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) ) = ( (-1 -2i) ) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = (-1 - 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, but we can compute the probabilities by taking the squared magnitude of c1 and c2.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue corresponding to |+x> is |c1|^2, and for |-x> it's |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Compute |c2|^2: [ (-1 -2i)/sqrt(14) ]^2 = ( ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the squared magnitude of a complex number a + ib is a^2 + b^2. So for c2:

c2 = (-1 - 2i)/sqrt(14)

So |c2|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (-2)^2 ] / (14) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357. But 9+5=14, so it sums to 1. That's correct.

Wait, but the options given are 0.64, 0.36, etc. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So the first part of the answer is probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A, B, C, D. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, but the operator's eigenvalues would be related to the average value.

Wait, but the question also asks for the average value of the operator.

Wait, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i!=j, else 0. So the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(1) )= hbar/2 and (hbar/2)(-1) )= -hbar/2.

So the average value is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, but perhaps it's easier to compute using the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps express |alpha> in the computational basis (|up> and |down>) and compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me compute that.

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

A is the matrix:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = [a*, b*] * A * [a; b]

Which is a* [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0 ] * [a; b]^T.

Wait, more precisely, it's (a* a A_11 + a* b A_12) + (b* a A_21 + b* b A_22 )

But A_11 = 0, A_22=0.

So,

= a* * (A_12) * b + b* * (A_21) * a

But A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2.

So,

= (a* b + b* a ) * (hbar/2 )

Wait, because A_12 and A_21 are both hbar/2, so their sum is 2*(hbar/2) )=hbar?

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Compute each term:

First, the product A * |alpha> is:

A |alpha> = [0 a; b 0 ] * [a; b] ?

Wait, no, matrix multiplication.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector [a; b]. So A times |alpha> is [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ] * [a; b] = [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is [a*, b* ] * [ (hbar/2) b; (hbar/2) a ].

Which is a* (hbar/2) b + b* (hbar/2) a.

So,

= (hbar/2) [ a* b + b* a ].

But a* b is ( (1+i)/√7 )^* * ( (2 -i)/√7 ) = (1-i)(2 -i)/7.

Similarly, b* a is (2 + i)(1 + i)/7.

Let me compute a* b:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i + i².

Which is 2 +3i -1 = 1+3i.

So b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding a* b + b* a: (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So,

Expectation value = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar /7.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the a* b and b* a.

Wait, a is (1+i)/√7, so a* is (1-i)/√7.

b is (2 -i)/√7, so b* is (2 +i)/√7.

Compute a* b:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, b* a is (2 +i)(1+i) = 2*(1) + 2*i +i*(1) +i*i.

Which is 2 +2i +i + (-1) = (2 -1) + (2i +i) )=1 +3i.

So when we add a* b + b* a: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )/7 = 2/7.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So the probabilities are 0.64 (9/14 ≈0.6428) and 0.36 (5/14≈0.357), and average is hbar/7.

So the options for probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

But wait, the question says the operator's matrix has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, which is what I used. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value. Another approach: since A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times <sigma_x>, which is (hbar/2) times (2 Re(a b* )) / (||a||^2 + ||b||^2 ).

Wait, perhaps I can compute <sigma_x> directly. Sigma_x is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so <sigma_x> is <up| + <down| times sigma_x times |alpha>.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute <sigma_x> as (alpha_up alpha_down* + alpha_down alpha_up* ) / (|alpha|^2 )

Because |alpha> is a normalized state, |alpha|^2=1.

So,

<sigma_x> = (a b* + b a* ) 

Which is (a b* + a* b ) /1.

Which is 2 Re(a b* ) = (a b* + a* b )

Wait, let me compute a b*:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

a b* = (1+i)(2 +i) /7.

Multiply it out: 1*2 + 1*i + i*2 +i*i = 2 +i +2i +i².

i² is -1, so 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So a b* = (1 +3i)/7.

Similarly, a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i)/7.

Which is 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² =2 -3i -1=1-3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

So a b* + a* b = (1+3i +1 -3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Therefore, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So the average value is hbar/7, which is option A's answer.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me check the probabilities again. The probabilities were 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities match option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves an electron state |α⟩ proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation A, where A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state is given as |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5

The total norm is √(2 + 5) = √7. Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of A
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, expand |α⟩ in this basis:
\[
|α⟩ = c_1|+x⟩ + c_2|-x⟩
\]
The coefficients \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are computed as:
\[
c_1 = \langle +x|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)^* + (2-i)^*}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1-i + 2+i}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
\[
c_2 = \langle -x|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)^* - (2-i)^*}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1-i - (2+i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1-2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \(c_1\) and \(c_2\):
\[
P(+x) = |c_1|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{-1-2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The operator A has eigenvalues \(\pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\). The average value is the expectation value of A in the state |α⟩:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α|A|α⟩
\]
Using the matrix representation of A, compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\langle up|down⟩ + \langle down|up⟩\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively, and the average value of the operator is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). These results match **Option A**.

Answer: A
