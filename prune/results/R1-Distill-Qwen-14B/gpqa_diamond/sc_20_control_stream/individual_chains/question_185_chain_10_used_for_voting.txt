Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, so this must be related to spin angular momentum.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product with n, which is a unit vector, means that H is a combination of these three matrices multiplied by components of n. So H is essentially proportional to the spin operator in the direction of n.

I think the general form of the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. Oh wait, right. So the Hamiltonian here would be like H = ε (σ · n). But wait, in the standard spin Hamiltonian, it's often H = ω S · n, where ω is some frequency or energy scale. So in that case, the eigenvalues would be ± (ω ħ/2), right?

Wait, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is ε times the Pauli vector dotted with n. So perhaps the eigenvalues are related to ε and the Pauli matrices' properties. Since σ · n is a matrix, when you find its eigenvalues, what do you get?

I remember that for any vector in the space, the dot product with σ is a Hermitian matrix. And the eigenvalues of σ · n should be ±1 because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and they are combined in a direction specified by n. So σ · n is a matrix whose trace is 0 (since it's Hermitian and each Pauli matrix has trace 0), and its eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

Wait, so if H is ε multiplied by σ · n, then the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. So that would make the eigenvalues ± ε * 1, which is ± ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the eigenvalues of any 2x2 Hermitian matrix like σ · n can be found by solving the characteristic equation. Let me think.

The matrix σ · n is n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. The Pauli matrices have the form of [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]] respectively. So when you take a linear combination with n_x, n_y, n_z, you get a 2x2 matrix. The trace of this matrix is n_z times (1) because only σz contributes to the trace. The trace is the sum of eigenvalues, so sum is n_z * 1, but wait, the trace of σ · n would be Tr(σ · n) = n_z * Tr(σz) + n_x Tr(σx) + n_y Tr(σy). But Tr(σx) and Tr(σy) are zero, and Tr(σz) is 1. So trace is n_z.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ1 + λ2 = n_z. Also, since the determinant of σ · n is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) (because (σ · n)^2 = I since n is a unit vector), wait no, that's not right. Let me compute (σ · n)^2.

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2.

Expanding this, each σi squared is I, and the cross terms are anti-commutators, but when you square, they'll involve terms like σi σj + σj σi which, for i≠j, equals 2 δij I. So the square would be (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I, which is I because n is a unit vector. So (σ · n)^2 = I.

So the eigenvalues of (σ · n) must satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1.

Thus, the eigenvalues of H = ε σ · n would be ε * (±1) → ±ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

Looking again at the options, option B matches. So the correct answer is B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant. The eigenvalues of \( H \) can be determined by analyzing the properties of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The Pauli matrices (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) are Hermitian, and their linear combination \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \) is also Hermitian. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), as this operator represents a spin component in the direction of \( \vec{n} \), and the spin matrices have eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

Since \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as shown above.  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as there is no factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in the eigenvalues.  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as this does not involve \( \varepsilon \).
