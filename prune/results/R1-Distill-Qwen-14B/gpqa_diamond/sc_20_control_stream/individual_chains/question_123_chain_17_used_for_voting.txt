Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this. Let me read the question again.

The problem states that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, and we're told to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so those factors don't come into play here.

Wait, so the key here is probably about relative motion and maybe time dilation or length contraction due to special relativity. Because if the frames are moving relative to each other, their measurements of time and distance can differ.

Let me think about the frames. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, these are two inertial frames moving at a relative velocity.

Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Like, if you're in a train moving at v relative to the platform, and you throw a ball at u relative to the train, the platform's speed of the ball isn't u + v. Instead, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

But wait, in this case, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s as well. Or is that correct? Wait no, no. Because in one frame, the object is moving at velocity v, in the other frame, it's moving at u, which depends on the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relative velocity between the two frames. Let me denote Gamma as the Galaxy's frame and E as the ejecta's frame.

In E's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards E at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative velocity between E and Gamma is 60,000 km/s. So, the speed is v = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at some speed. Let me think about how to relate the two frames. Because when you switch frames, velocities transform.

So, in Gamma (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity u. In E's frame, the Galaxy is moving at velocity u' = -u (since if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, the Galaxy appears to move towards the ejecta). But according to the problem, in E's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards E at 60,000 km/s, so u' = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but according to the velocity transformation formula in special relativity, u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²), where v is the relative speed between the frames. Wait, no, wait, I think I have the formula wrong. Let me get it right.

The velocity transformation formula is: u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but if E is moving at velocity v relative to Gamma, then from Gamma's frame, the object (ejecta) is moving at u. From E's frame, the object's speed is u'.

But in this problem, the object's speed in E's frame is 60,000 km/s. So, u' = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but what's v here? Because if E is moving at velocity v relative to Gamma, then in Gamma's frame, E is moving at v, and in E's frame, Gamma is moving at -v.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me restate: Let's say that in Gamma's frame, the ejecta (E) is moving at velocity u. Then, in E's frame, Gamma is moving at velocity u', which is not necessarily equal to -u, because of relativity.

Wait, from E's frame, Gamma is moving towards E at 60,000 km/s. So, u' = -60,000 km/s (assuming u' is the velocity of Gamma in E's frame). Wait, no, I'm getting confused with directions. Let me pick a direction convention.

Let's define positive direction as the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy's center. So, in Gamma's frame, the ejecta's velocity is u. In E's frame, the Galaxy's velocity is u', which is towards E, so u' = -60,000 km/s.

Wait, but no. If in E's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards E, that would be in the opposite direction. Let me think again.

Let me make it more precise. Let's say that in the Gamma frame (the Galaxy), the ejecta (E) is moving at velocity u towards the center, which is in the positive direction. So, from Gamma's perspective, E is moving at u = 60,000 km/s towards the center. Alternatively, maybe not, because the problem says in E's frame, the center is moving towards E at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. Because in E's frame, Gamma is moving at 60,000 km/s, so from E's frame, the speed of Gamma is 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between E and Gamma is 60,000 km/s.

But in Gamma's frame, what is E's speed?

Wait, according to special relativity, the relative speed between two inertial frames is v, so if E is moving at v in Gamma's frame, then in E's frame, Gamma is moving at v as well, but in the opposite direction. Because the relative speed is symmetric in that sense. But wait, that's not exactly correct because of the velocity transformations.

Wait, no, the relative speed isn't symmetric in that way because of the velocity addition formula. For instance, if you're on a train moving at 0.8c relative to the platform, you can't just say that the platform is moving at 0.8c relative to you. Wait, no, actually, velocity transformations show that if one frame moves at v relative to another, the reverse is also v, but when adding velocities, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to find the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame. Because the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame over a certain time.

But the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, we have to consider time dilation perhaps.

Wait, here's the setup: in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. What is the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame? Because time will dilate due to the relative motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is straightforward, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about how time and distance transform between the two frames.

In the ejecta's frame (E), it's stationary, and the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, in E's frame, the center moves 60,000 km/s * t_E, where t_E is 50 seconds.

So, distance in E's frame is 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km. But that's not the question. The question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in Gamma's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the distance would be u * t_Gamma, where t_Gamma is the time in Gamma's frame.

But how is t_Gamma related to t_E?

Because of time dilation. Since the two frames are moving relative to each other at speed v, the time intervals will differ.

Wait, from E's frame, Gamma's clock runs slower. So, if 50 seconds pass in E's frame, how much time passes in Gamma's frame?

We can use the time dilation formula: delta t_Gamma = delta t_E * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative speed. But wait, in this case, v is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but c is about 300,000 km/s. So v is 0.2c.

Wait, let me calculate the Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.

So, v²/c² = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.

So, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, the time in Gamma's frame, delta t_Gamma = delta t_E * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 50 s * sqrt(0.96) ≈ 50 * 0.9798 ≈ 48.99 seconds.

So, the time in Gamma's frame is approximately 48.99 seconds.

Wait, but wait, that's the time in Gamma's frame. So, the ejecta is moving at what speed in Gamma's frame?

Wait, in Gamma's frame, the ejecta is moving at u. From the problem, in E's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s, which would be the same as the ejecta's speed in Gamma's frame, correct? Because if E is the ejecta's frame, and Gamma is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to E, then in Gamma's frame, E is moving at 60,000 km/s towards Gamma.

Wait, so u = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, so in Gamma's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

So, the distance the ejecta travels in Gamma's frame is u * t_Gamma.

We have t_Gamma ≈ 48.99 seconds.

So, distance = 60,000 km/s * 48.99 s ≈ 60,000 * 48.99.

Calculating that: 60,000 * 48.99 = let's compute 60,000 * 49 = 2,940,000. But 48.99 is slightly less than 49, so 60,000 * (49 - 0.01) = 2,940,000 - 600 = 2,939,400 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2,940,000 km, which is 60,000 *49, which would be the case if the time were exactly 49 seconds. But the time is about 48.99, so the distance would be a little less than 2,940,000 km.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the exact gamma factor.

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.

So, v²/c² = 0.04.

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = let me compute that accurately.

0.96^0.5: Let me see, 0.9798 squared is approximately (0.98 * 0.98) = 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.

So, delta t_Gamma = 50 * 0.9798 = 48.99 s.

So, time in Gamma's frame is approximately 48.99 seconds.

So, ejecta's velocity is 60,000 km/s.

Distance = 60,000 * 48.99 = ?

60,000 * 48 is 2,880,000.

60,000 * 0.99 = 59,400.

So total distance is 2,880,000 + 59,400 = 2,939,400 km. So approximately 2,939,400 km.

Looking at the options, option A is 2,940,000 km, which is very close. So perhaps it's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Wait, let's compute 60,000 * 48.99:

= 60,000 * (48 + 0.99)
= 60,000 *48 + 60,000 * 0.99
= 2,880,000 + 59,400
= 2,939,400 km.

But none of the options exactly match 2,939,400.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2,880,000 km, which would be the 48 seconds distance (60,000 *48 = 2,880,000). Option A is 2,940,000, which is 60,000 *49.

But our calculation is 48.99, which is about 48.99 seconds, so 48.99 *60,000 = 2,939,400 km.

Hmm, perhaps the question is intended to use a different approach, perhaps not using relativity, but just classical mechanics. But that seems unlikely, because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20% c), so relativistic effects are non-negligible.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. We need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during that time, and then compute the distance.

Wait, using time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame is delta t = delta t_e * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, because from the moving frame's perspective (E), the stationary frame's (Gamma) time runs slower.

Wait, no, I think I had it inverted. The time dilation formula is: in a frame moving relative to you, their clocks run slower. So, if E is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to Gamma, then from E's frame, Gamma's clocks are moving, so in E's frame, Gamma's time runs slower.

Wait, but the time in E's frame (delta t_e) is 50 seconds. So, the time in Gamma's frame (delta t) is delta t_e * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, no. Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. If the ejecta is moving, then perhaps the proper time is in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait, proper time is the time measured in the frame where both events occur at the same position. So, if we have two events (e.g., the start and end of the 50 seconds) happening at the same spot in E's frame, then delta t_e is the proper time, and the time in Gamma's frame (delta t) would be longer than delta t_e.

Wait, but in this case, in E's frame, the 50 seconds pass between two events (say, the start of the timer and the end of the timer) that are at the same place in E's frame. So, this is the proper time. Therefore, the time in Gamma's frame would be delta t = delta t_e / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, because in Gamma's frame, the events are not at the same place, so time dilation applies. Let me clarify.

The time dilation formula says that the time between two events in a frame S' (the moving frame) is delta t' = delta t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where delta t is the time in S (the stationary frame).

Wait, no, wait: Suppose S is the stationary frame, and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then, if two events occur at the same place in S', then the time between them in S' is the proper time, tau. The time in S would be delta t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But in our case, the 50 seconds in E's frame are the proper time because in E's frame, the two events (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same location. So, the corresponding time in Gamma's frame would be longer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that delta t_Gamma is shorter than delta t_e, but that's incorrect because if the proper time is in E's frame, then Gamma's frame would see a longer time.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

So, the proper time tau is the time in the frame where the events are at the same place. So, if in E's frame, the two events (start and end of time) happen at the same place, then tau = 50 s.

In Gamma's frame, which is moving relative to E, the time delta t would be longer.

The formula is tau = delta t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → delta t = tau / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, no, wait, correct formula is:

In S (Gamma's frame), the time between two events is longer than the proper time in S' (E's frame). So, delta t = gamma * tau.

Where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, tau is the proper time, 50 s.

So, delta t = 50 s / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.02 s.

Wait, that's different from before. So, in Gamma's frame, the time that passes is approximately 51.02 seconds.

So, the ejecta is moving at u = 60,000 km/s in Gamma's frame.

Wait, but wait, is u the same as v? Because v is the relative speed between the frames. Hmm, yes, because u is the speed of the ejecta in Gamma's frame, and since E is moving at v=60,000 km/s relative to Gamma, the ejecta's speed in Gamma's frame is 60,000 km/s.

So, the distance the ejecta travels in Gamma's frame is u * delta t = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.02 ≈ 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because I thought the proper time was 50 seconds, but earlier I thought delta t_Gamma was shorter. So which approach is correct?

Wait, let me think again. The question is, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. What is the time in the Galaxy's frame during that period?

In the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of the timer) happen at the same place, so tau is 50 s. In Gamma's frame, the same events are moving (since the ejecta is moving relative to Gamma), so the time in Gamma's frame is longer.

So, delta t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 51.02 seconds.

So, the ejecta moves at u = 60,000 km/s for delta t = ~51.02 seconds.

Distance = 60,000 * 51.02 ≈ 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the velocity u was 60,000 km/s in Gamma's frame. But I'm not entirely sure, perhaps I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the frames. Let me try a different approach.

Let me use the Lorentz transformations. Let's say that in E's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards E at velocity v. So, in E's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between E and Gamma is v = 60,000 km/s.

In E's frame, the time between the two events (start and end) is tau = 50 s.

In Gamma's frame, the coordinates are different. Let's use the Lorentz transformation to find the time and position.

The Lorentz transformation equations are:

t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c² )

x' = gamma (x - v t )

But I think it's easier to think in terms of proper time. Alternatively, perhaps using the velocity and time dilation correctly.

Wait, another approach: the distance the ejecta travels in Gamma's frame is u * t, where u is the velocity of the ejecta in Gamma's frame, and t is the time in Gamma's frame.

Wait, but in this case, u is the same as v, because the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center in Gamma's frame. So, u = 60,000 km/s.

So, the key is to find t, the time in Gamma's frame. How is t related to the 50 seconds in E's frame?

As before, t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈51.02 s.

So, distance is 60,000 * 51.02 ≈ 3,061,200 km.

Which matches option D: 3,060,000 km.

So, the answer would be D.

But wait, earlier I thought the time in Gamma's frame would be shorter, but that's when the events are not in the same place in the moving frame. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it this way: In E's frame, 50 seconds pass, and during that time, the center of the galaxy (Gamma) moves closer. But what is the corresponding time in Gamma's frame?

If I'm in Gamma's frame, the ejecta is moving towards me at 60,000 km/s. So, from my perspective, the ejecta is moving, and my time runs normally. But according to E, I (Gamma) am moving towards E at 60,000 km/s.

So, the time experienced by E (the proper time) is 50 s. So, in Gamma's frame, the same duration would be longer, because E's clock is moving relative to me.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The proper time is the shortest time between two events. So, if E is moving relative to Gamma, the time in Gamma's frame is longer than the proper time.

So, in Gamma's frame, the time that passes is longer than 50 seconds.

But earlier, using the Lorentz factor, I found t ≈51.02 seconds, which is correct. So, the distance is 60,000 *51.02 ≈3,061,200 km, so option D is 3,060,000, which is the closest.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought that when the proper time is 50, the time in the other frame would be longer, but I'm not 100% confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a classical approach, simply using v = d/t, without considering relativity. But 60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light, so relativistic effects are significant and can't be ignored. So the answer must involve relativity.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the distance in the Galaxy frame, given that in the Ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. Without considering relativity, the distance would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. So, option B is 3,000,000 km.

But that ignores time dilation, which would change the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame, leading to a longer time and thus a longer distance.

I think the correct approach is to use the relativistic time dilation and find the distance as approximately 3,061,200 km, so the correct option is D) 3,060,000 km.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame, considering relativistic effects due to the high relative velocity between the two frames (60,000 km/s, or 0.2c). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Velocity and Time Dilation**:  
   The problem specifies that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (\(t_{\text{Galaxy}}\)) is longer than the proper time (\(t_{\text{ejecta}}\)) by a factor of the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)). The Lorentz factor is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c\):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  
   The time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Galaxy}} = \gamma \cdot t_{\text{ejecta}} = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a constant velocity of \(u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\). The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   d = u \cdot t_{\text{Galaxy}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(t_{\text{Galaxy}} \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}\):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\(3,061,800 \, \text{km}\)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during intermediate steps.

Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.

Answer: D
