Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So, a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer. That makes sense.

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is constant in all directions. So, if I consider a spherical shell at a certain distance from us, there should be a certain number of stars on that shell.

Wait, how does the number of stars relate to parallax? Parallax plx is related to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So, distance d = 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars per unit volume should be the same everywhere because of uniform distribution. But since we're looking at a range of plx, which translates to a range of distances, we need to find how the number of stars in a thin shell (at a particular plx) relates to plx.

Consider a thin spherical shell at distance d (so plx = 1/d). The volume of a thin shell is approximately the surface area multiplied by the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and the thickness in distance terms is dd. But wait, we're dealing with parallax, so how does a change in plx relate to a change in d?

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, let's see: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So, the thickness in terms of distance is inversely proportional to plx squared times the change in plx.

But wait, I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit plx. Let me think in terms of number density. The number of stars per unit volume is n, which is constant. So, the number of stars in a shell is n multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, but the shell's volume is approximately 4πd² * dd. So, number of stars in the shell, N = n * 4π d² * dd.

But since we want it per unit plx, we need to express this in terms of plx.

We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Substitute that into the equation.

N ≈ n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But wait, what's dd in terms of d plx?

From plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx. So, substituting that into N:

N ≈ n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-d² d plx).

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx².

So, substituting:

N ≈ n *4π * (1/plx^2) * ( (1/plx^2) ) * d plx.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express that:

N ≈ n * 4π * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) ) * d plx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me redo the substitution.

Wait, dd is in terms of d plx. So:

dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

Because from plx = 1/d, taking derivative: d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx.

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx)^2.

So, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π d² * dd.

Substitute d² and dd:

N = n *4π * (1/plx²) * [ - (1/plx²) d plx ].

So,

N = n *4π * (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but N is the number of stars in a shell of parallax range d plx. So, the number per unit plx (d plx = 1) is N = 4π n / (plx^4).

Hmm, that's a 1/plx^4 dependence. So, the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/(plx)^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + d plx is N = n * volume.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² * dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. Now, how much is dd in terms of d plx?

As before, d plx is the change in parallax, which is small. Since plx = 1/d, dd = (d plx) * (d plx/ d plx) = ?

Wait, the derivative of d with respect to plx is:

dd/d plx = d(1/plx)/d plx = -1/(plx^2).

So, dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So, plugging into volume:

Volume = 4π (d)^2 * dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx ) = -4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But volume can't be negative, so the magnitude is 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Number of stars N = n * volume = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number per unit plx (d plx = 1) is N = (4π n ) / (plx^4).

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases with plx^4. So the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, wait. I think I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, not the number as a function. So if I'm in a range of plx, say from plx to plx + d plx, how does the number of stars (N) in that range vary with plx?

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. So, the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^4 times d plx. So for a fixed d plx, say 1 unit of plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance to the star in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\), the number of stars \(N\) in the shell is proportional to the volume of the shell and the number density of stars \(n\), which is constant due to the uniform distribution of stars. The volume of the shell is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 \, dd,
\]

where \(dd\) is the thickness of the shell in distance. To express the number of stars in terms of parallax, we note that \(d = 1/\text{plx}\), so \(dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\). Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\) into the volume expression, we get:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change in distance, but the magnitude of the volume is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in the shell is then:

\[
N = n \cdot \text{Volume} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

For a unit range of parallax (\(d\text{plx} = 1\)), the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with \(\text{plx}^4\). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4.**
