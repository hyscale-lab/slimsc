Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again. 

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. These planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They all have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for that involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since all have the same albedo, that part cancels out, so I don't need to worry about it.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, wait. Or is it T = T_star * (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again.

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature (assuming it's a blackbody) would be T = T_s * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). But since all the planets orbit the same star, T_s and L are the same for all. The albedo affects the temperature as well, but since they're the same, it cancels. So the temperature ratio depends on the square of the distance.

Wait, more accurately, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but wait, no, period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. Oh wait, the period ratio is given, so I can relate their distances using Kepler's law.

Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming the same star. So for any two planets, P² = (a³)/(M_star), but since M_star is same for all, P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). So if I have two planets, Planet 2 and Planet 4, their distances a2 and a4 are proportional to (P2)^(2/3) and (P4)^(2/3), respectively.

So the ratio a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Then, since the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a (since T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4) ), wait no, let me correct that.

Wait, no. The equilibrium temperature T is given by the formula T = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ a^2) )^(1/4 ), but since A (albedo) is the same for all, and L and T_star are the same, it simplifies to T ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), because 1/a² is under a square root when you take the fourth root. Wait, let's think step by step.

Equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_s * ( (1 - A)/(2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ a^2) )^(1/4 )

But since A, L, and T_s are the same for all planets, T_eq is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = (1/a)^(1/2). So T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Alternatively, T_eq ∝ 1/a^0.5.

So the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). So their ratio is sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, let me see: T4/T2 = [ (1/a4)^(1/2) ] / [ (1/a2)^(1/2) ] = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2/a4).

So I need to find the ratio of a2 to a4, take its square root, and that's the temperature ratio.

Now, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

But wait, the periods are given in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So the planets are Planet_1 through Planet_5, with periods in ratios 1, 2, 2.5,3.5,5.

So Planet_2 has period P2 = 2, Planet_4 has P4=3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈0.5714.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3). So (4/7) is approximately 0.5714.

Wait, but wait, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 is sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) ) = x^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, a2 is (2)^(2/3), a4 is (3.5)^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

And then T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

So (4/7)^(1/3) is cube root of (4/7).

Let me compute that. 4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714.

I know that cube root of 1 is 1. Cube root of 0.512 is 0.8 because 0.8^3=0.512. Cube root of 0.729 is 0.9.

Wait, 0.5714 is between 0.512 and 0.729. Let me think.

What is 0.8^3? 0.512.

0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889, multiplied by 0.83: approx 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.571. Oh wait, wow, that's exactly our number.

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. I thought earlier that the ratio would be T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused about which planet is which. Let me make sure.

Wait, the question is the ratio of Planet_4's temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2. Earlier, we found T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Which is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck. Let's make sure I didn't make any mistake in the setup.

Another way to approach: T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). And a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So T is proportional to 1/(P^(2/3 * 1/2)) ) = 1/(P^(1/3)).

So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because T4 = constant * P4^(-1/3) and T2 = constant * P2^(-1/3).

So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Ah, that's an alternative way to see it.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, as before.

So yeah, that's correct.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), we find that \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of distances \( a_2/a_4 \) is proportional to \( (P_2/P_4)^{2/3} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we identify \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio \( P_2/P_4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \approx 0.5714 \). Therefore, \( a_2/a_4 = (4/7)^{2/3} \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is proportional to \( \sqrt{a_2/a_4} \), so:

\[
T_4/T_2 = \sqrt{(4/7)^{2/3}} = (4/7)^{1/3}.
\]

To compute \( (4/7)^{1/3} \), we approximate \( 4/7 \approx 0.5714 \). The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \), as \( 0.83^3 \approx 0.571 \).

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), corresponding to option C.

The albedo affects the temperature as well, but since they're the same, it cancels. So the temperature ratio depends on the square of the distance.

Wait, more accurately, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but wait, no, period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. Oh wait, the period ratio is given, so I can relate their distances using Kepler's law.

Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming the same star. So for any two planets, P² = (a³)/(M_star), but since M_star is same for all, P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). So if I have two planets, Planet 2 and Planet 4, their distances a2 and a4 are proportional to (P2)^(2/3) and (P4)^(2/3), respectively.

So the ratio a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Then, since the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a (since T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4) ), wait no, let me correct that.

Wait, no. The equilibrium temperature T is given by the formula T = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ a^2) )^(1/4 ), but since A (albedo) is the same for all, and L and T_star are the same, it simplifies to T ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), because 1/a² is under a square root when you take the fourth root. Wait, let's think step by step.

Equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_s * ( (1 - A)/(2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ a^2) )^(1/4 )

But since A, L, and T_s are the same for all planets, T_eq is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = (1/a)^(1/2). So T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Alternatively, T_eq ∝ 1/a^0.5.

So the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). So their ratio is sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, let me see: T4/T2 = [ (1/a4)^(1/2) ] / [ (1/a2)^(1/2) ] = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2/a4).

So I need to find the ratio of a2 to a4, take its square root, and that's the temperature ratio.

Now, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

But wait, the periods are given in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So the planets are Planet_1 through Planet_5, with periods in ratios 1, 2, 2.5,3.5,5.

So Planet_2 has period P2 = 2, Planet_4 has P4=3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈0.5714.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3). So (4/7) is approximately 0.5714.

Wait, but wait, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 is sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) ) = x^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, a2 is (2)^(2/3), a4 is (3.5)^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

And then T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

So (4/7)^(1/3) is cube root of (4/7).

Let me compute that. 4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714.

I know that cube root of 1 is 1. Cube root of 0.512 is 0.8 because 0.8^3=0.512. Cube root of 0.729 is 0.9.

Wait, 0.5714 is between 0.512 and 0.729. Let me think.

What is 0.8^3? 0.512.

0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889, multiplied by 0.83: approx 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.571. Oh wait, wow, that's exactly our number.

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. I thought earlier that the ratio would be T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused about which planet is which. Let me make sure.

Wait, the question is the ratio of Planet_4's temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2. Earlier, we found T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Which is approximately 0.83.

So T is proportional to 1/(P^(2/3 * 1/2)) ) = 1/(P^(1/3)).

So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because T4 = constant * P4^(-1/3) and T2 = constant * P2^(-1/3).

So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Ah, that's an alternative way to see it.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, as before.

So yeah, that's correct.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we identify \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio \( P_2/P_4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \approx 0.5714 \). Therefore, \( a_2/a_4 = (4/7)^{2/3} \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is proportional to \( \sqrt{a_2/a_4} \), so:

\[
T_4/T_2 = \sqrt{(4/7)^{2/3}} = (4/7)^{1/3}.
\]

To compute \( (4/7)^{1/3} \), we approximate \( 4/7 \approx 0.5714 \). The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \), as \( 0.83^3 \approx 0.571 \).

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), corresponding to option C.
