Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks right for the expected molecule, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, it's not a splitting due to coupling because the coupling is ruled out by the coupling pattern. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity at elevated temperature. Both have the same mass as expected. So, the same molecular weight but two peaks. 

The options are:
A) Contaminated with a precursor
B) Mixture of enantiomers
C) Double coupling during amide bond formation
D) Mixture of diastereoisomers

Hmm, so what's going on here. Let's start with the NMR part. The same alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Why would that happen? Well, in an NMR, each proton environment should give a unique signal. If the same alpha-proton is split into two, it could mean that the proton isn't in the same environment every time. 

Wait, but the integrals add to 1H. And the chemical shifts are similar. So maybe the molecule is in two different environments, causing the same proton to resonate slightly differently. But why would that be?

If it's a diastereomer, then the same proton would be in a different environment. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR signals would split. Enantiomers, on the other hand, have identical NMR signals because they're mirror images. So in that case, the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So maybe the diastereomer option (D) is possible.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the compound shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So, for example, if there's a stereocenter, and the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, then the same proton would be in different environments, leading to different shifts. But in that case, the two peaks would perhaps integrate to 1H each? Or would they add up? Let me think.

Hmm, if it's a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each with their own environment for that alpha-proton, then the integral would each be 0.5H, adding up to 1H. That matches the question. And the shifts would be similar but not identical. So diastereomers could be the cause. 

What about enantiomers? If it's a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same alpha-proton environment. So their NMR signals would overlap as one peak. So option B is not likely here.

Option A: contamination with a precursor. If that's the case, the NMR would show peaks from the precursor. But the question says the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule, except for the two alpha-proton peaks. So maybe the peaks are from the same compound, not another substance.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure what that refers to. Maybe during the reaction, two couplings happened, causing multiple signals. But I'm not familiar with 'double coupling' as a term. Alternatively, perhaps it's some kind of coupling in the NMR, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not the issue.

Looking at the LC-MS part: two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight, same retention time? Or different? Wait, LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So same molecular weight but different structures? Or same structure but different conformations? No, same mass and same structure would be same compound, but different conformations wouldn't split peaks in LC-MS. 

Wait, no. In LC-MS, if it's same molecular weight, but different structures, but same mass? Wait, no. Wait, same mass would imply same molecular weight. So two peaks with same mass but different structures. But that's impossible unless they're isobars, which is rare. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the same compound but in different conformations, but LC-MS wouldn't split peaks based on that.

Wait, but wait. If the compound is a diastereomer, then the structures are different. But would they have same molecular weight? Yes, because diastereomers have same molecular formula. So the mass spec would show same mass. So the LC would separate them because they have different physical properties, leading to different retention times. Hence, two peaks of same mass but different structures. 

So, in the LC-MS analysis, if the compound is a diastereomer mixture, you would see two peaks with same mass but different retention times. That fits the description, where there are two peaks of equal intensity. But wait, what about the temperature? The question says elevated temperature. So maybe the compounds are melting or something? Not sure, but perhaps the temperature affects the separation.

So putting this together: The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same integral, same shift ish. The LC-MS shows two same mass peaks. The options point to D, diastereomers. 

Wait, but why would the NMR show two peaks? Because in diastereomers, the environment is different. So if the alpha-proton is in a different environment, like if the configuration around a stereocenter affects it, then each diastereomer would have a different shift for that proton. 

So if the crude compound is a racemic mixture, you wouldn't get two peaks for the same proton. But if it's a diastereomer mixture, then you would. 

So the most likely explanation is diastereomers. So the answer is D.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **NMR Observations**:
   - The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggests that the proton is in two distinct environments. 
   - The integrals add up to 1H, and the chemical shifts are similar but not identical, indicating a mixture of compounds with slightly different physical environments for the proton.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause of the splitting.

2. **LC-MS Observations**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass are observed. This suggests the presence of two compounds with the same molecular weight but different structures.
   - Elevated temperature may affect separation but does not explain the presence of two distinct peaks.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **(A) Contamination with a precursor**: This would result in additional peaks in the NMR corresponding to the precursor's protons and a different mass in the LC-MS. However, the question specifies that the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule, making this unlikely.
   - **(B) Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers have identical physical properties, so their NMR signals would overlap as a single peak. This does not match the observation of two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.
   - **(C) 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation**: This term is unclear, but the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the splitting, making this explanation unlikely.
   - **(D) Mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereomers have different physical properties, leading to distinct NMR signals for the same proton in different environments. This explains the two peaks in the NMR spectrum. Additionally, diastereomers have the same molecular weight, which aligns with the LC-MS observations of two peaks with the same mass.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations.
