Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Right, metathesis breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. The Grubbs catalyst, especially the first-generation one, is good for ring-closing metathesis and some cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's double-check. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on the third carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure is probably CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, wait. Let me think about the structure again.

Pent-1-ene is five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on C3. So structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, that's not possible because C3 would be the third carbon. Let me number: 1 2 3 4 5. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. 3-methyl would be a CH(CH3) group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it:

For pent-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3.

But when it's 3-methyl, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the methyl is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So correct structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, pent has five carbons.

So the correct structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Let me count: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 has five carbons? Let's count them as 1,2,3,4,5.

1: CH2= 
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH2
5: CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene, right. So the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Now, it's racemic, so it's a 50-50 mixture of two enantiomers. But wait, can 3-methylpent-1-ene have geometric isomerism? Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on either side are CH3 (on C2) and CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (on C1). Wait, actually, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So on C1, we have CH2 and on C2, CH. The groups on each carbon are CH2- and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, the substituents on each carbon: Carbon 1 has two CH2 groups (from CH2=CH-...), and carbon 2 has a CH group attached to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the structure as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 has a methyl group.

Now, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis. The reaction involves the breaking of the double bond and the redistribution of the substituents. Grubbs can induce different types of metathesis, such as ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis.

In this case, the starting molecule is a mono-olefin, so the metathesis would likely lead to a ring formation if possible, or perhaps other products. Alternatively, it might undergo a cross metathesis if there are other alkenes, but since it's just this one, perhaps it's a ring-closing reaction.

Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mono-olefin. So, when Grubbs is used, it can cause the olefin to undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let me think: Grubbs catalyst can facilitate the exchange of substituents across the double bond, leading to new alkenes.

But wait, another possibility is that the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a ring. Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's imagine the two ends of the molecule (the CH2=CH- and the CH2-CH3) reacting. If the Grubbs catalyst facilitates a metathesis between the two ends, perhaps forming a ring.

But wait, let me think about the possible products. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross metathesis, but without another alkene, that's not possible. So more likely, it's a ring-closing metathesis.

Let me imagine that the ends of the molecule undergo metathesis. So, the CH2=CH- group and the CH2-CH3 group could exchange. So, the double bond would break, and the two ends would swap partners.

So, the original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, and then recombining. The possible products would form a ring if the molecule is long enough. Let me count the carbons between the ends for possible ring size.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The other end is CH2-CH3. So, if a ring forms, how many atoms would the ring have?

The chain from C1 to the end is: C1 (CH2-), C2 (CH-), C3 (CH(CH3)-), C4 (CH2-), C5 (CH3). Wait, but actually, the chain is from the double bond end (C1 and C2) to the other end (C5). So, the distance is four carbons apart. Let's see: the double bond is between C1 and C2. The other end is C5. So, the chain from C2 to C5 is three carbons (C3, C4, C5). So, if the catalyst causes a metathesis between the two ends, the ring formed would be a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe. Let's see: when the CH2=CH- part and the CH2-CH3 part undergo metathesis, the double bond would form a new ring. So, the structure would be a cyclopentane derivative.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a bicyclic structure? Or maybe a five-membered ring. Let me draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to think about the possible alkenes formed. The metathesis can produce different alkenes, so the question is about how many different products are possible.

Wait, the question specifies "excluding ethene," so any ethene produced would not count. But in a ring-closing metathesis, ethene might be a byproduct. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to undergo a cross metathesis with itself, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, another approach: The Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene, and it can facilitate the exchange of substituents across the double bond. So, the process can lead to different alkenes based on how the substituents rearrange.

Let me think about the structure. The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Structure: CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3.

When Grubbs is added, it can cause the olefin to undergo metathesis. The possible products would be different alkenes. But considering it's a racemic mixture, how does that affect the outcome?

Wait, Grubbs is a chiral catalyst? No, wait, Grubbs catalyst is typically achiral. So, it would not induce asymmetry in the product beyond what is present in the starting material.

Wait, wait, the starting material is racemic, meaning that it's a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. But I'm not sure if the chirality affects the number of products.

Wait, in this case, the molecule is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. When Grubbs catalyst is used, it can cause the olefin to form a new double bond by breaking the existing one and rearranging.

But perhaps more importantly, since the starting molecule is a racemic mixture, the metathesis could lead to both possible diastereomers or enantiomers, but since the catalyst is achiral, perhaps the products would also be a racemic mixture if any new chiral centers are formed.

Wait, but in this problem, we are just considering the number of different possible products, regardless of their stereochemistry. Or perhaps the question counts stereoisomers as separate products.

Wait, the question asks for the number of possible products, so I need to consider all possible structures, including stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because there are multiple sites where metathesis can occur.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting alkene can undergo different metathesis pathways. For example, the double bond could break in different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopentene or other ring structures, or maybe cross metathesis with itself, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all possible products that can form. Let me think about possible metathesis products.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two ends of the molecule would meet, forming a ring and releasing ethylene. So, in this case, the molecule has five carbons with a double bond at the first position.

If the ends are the CH2=CH and the CH2CH3 parts, then connecting those could form a ring. Let's imagine the double bond breaking and the two ends (CH2- and CH3) recombining.

Wait, perhaps the chain is longer. Let me count the carbons between the double bond ends.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the chain from the double bond (C1 and C2) to the end (C5) is four carbons long (C3 and C4 are in between). So, if the Grubbs catalyst causes the two ends to form a ring, the ring size would depend on where the metathesis occurs.

Wait, the possible rings that can form: if the metathesis occurs between C1 and C5, the ring would have four members (since there are four carbons between the ends, but including the double bond, perhaps I'm getting this wrong).

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formed would have five members. Let me think: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the metathesis occurs between the CH2=CH and the CH2-CH3 ends, the ring would be a five-membered ring: the new double bond would be between C1 and C5, but that doesn't make sense because that's a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the two ends (CH2=CH and CH2CH3) would form a new double bond, creating a ring.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible new alkenes formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis will break the double bond and form a new one. So, the original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the possible new alkenes would be:

1. CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with the new double bond somewhere else. Wait, no, metathesis doesn't form single bonds; it swaps substituents.

Wait, metathesis cleaves the double bond and recombines the substituents. So, for each olefin, the catalyst can exchange the groups on each end.

So, the general reaction is R1-R2 double bond R3-R4 → R1-R4 double bond R2-R3, along with the exchange of substituents.

So, in this case, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's denote this as R1=CH2-, R2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the possible products. So, the Grubbs catalyst would allow the olefin to undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let's see:

The molecule is long enough to form a five-membered ring. The structure would be:

After metathesis, the double bond would be between C3 and C4 perhaps, but wait, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when Grubbs is used on a mono-olefin, it can cause ring-closing metathesis if the molecule is long enough. Let me think about the chain length. The molecule here is five carbons, so the end groups are CH2=CH- and CH2-CH3.

If the metathesis occurs between the CH2=CH group and the CH2-CH3 group, the molecule would form a ring. The new double bond would be between C1 and C5. Wait, that would form a five-membered ring with a double bond, making it a cyclopentene derivative.

So, the product would be cyclopentene with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents would be arranged differently. Let me visualize:

The original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the ends (CH2=CH- and -CH2-CH3) undergo metathesis, they could form a ring. The new structure would be a cycloalkene, specifically a cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene with a methyl group and another substituent. So, the structure would be:

The ring would be five-membered, with a double bond. Let me think about the substituents. The original groups on each end are CH2 and CH3. So, after metathesis, the ring would have substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the process leads to the formation of two different alkenes. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Another possibility is that the Grubbs catalyst could cause the olefin to form a new alkene by rearrangement, leading to different possible alkenes. Let me think about all possible alkenes that could form.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. After metathesis, the possible alkenes would depend on the positions where the double bonds can form.

The molecule has five carbons. Possible alkenes after metathesis could be 2-methylpent-2-ene, maybe other isomers.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible alkenes depends on the possible positions of the double bonds that can form.

Wait, but Grubbs tends to favor the formation of more substituted alkenes, due to the stability of the transition state.

Alternatively, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst tends to form the most stable rings, which are typically five or six-membered rings.

So, in this case, the molecule is five carbons, so a five-membered ring would be formed.

Wait, but how does that translate into the structure of the product? The product would be a cyclic alkene with substituents.

Wait, let's try to draw it.

Original structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the double bond is between C1 and C5, but that's not possible since the molecule is linear. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a ring where the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new alkene in a different position, leading to different structural isomers.

Wait, but without considering stereochemistry, perhaps the number of possible structural isomers is limited.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When Grubbs catalyst is used, the possible products are the result of the olefin metathesis, which can lead to different alkenes.

The reaction could produce two different alkenes, each as a pair of enantiomers. But since the starting material is racemic, how does that affect the products?

Wait, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to products that are themselves racemic, but the problem is about the number of possible products, not considering stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait, the question says 'how many possible products are there (excluding ethene)'.

So, perhaps the major product is a single cycloalkene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to two different products. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting molecule is a mono-olefin, so the Grubbs catalyst will facilitate a ring-closing metathesis, resulting in a cyclic alkene. So the product would be a single structure, but perhaps if there are multiple possible ring sizes, but in this case, the molecule is five carbons, so it can only form a five-membered ring.

Wait, but maybe the ring can form in different ways, leading to different substituents.

Wait, maybe the substituents could be arranged in different positions, leading to different isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is unique, so the number of products is 1, but that's not one of the options. The options are 4, 8, 6, or 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the starting material can undergo more than one type of metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to shift, leading to different alkenes. So, the reaction can produce multiple alkenes.

Wait, let me think: The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When treated with Grubbs, the possible products could be different alkenes.

The possible alkenes that can form:

1. 2-methylpent-2-ene.

2. 3-methylpent-2-ene.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about possible metathesis products.

In olefin metathesis, the catalyst can cause the breaking and reforming of the double bond in a way that swaps the substituents on each carbon.

So, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In metathesis, the two R groups on each side of the double bond can exchange. So, the left side is CH2- and the right side is CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

After metathesis, the product could be CH2-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but wait, that's not possible because that would form a single bond, but metathesis forms new double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis forms a new double bond elsewhere. Let me think about possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two new alkenes: one where the double bond is between C1 and C2 (original), and another where the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, but that's not correct because metathesis doesn't just shift the double bond; it breaks and reforms it.

Wait, perhaps the process is more about the redistribution of substituents. So, for the starting molecule, the groups on each end of the double bond are CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but in metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and allow the groups to exchange. So, the new products would have the substituents swapped.

But wait, in this case, the groups on the double bond are CH2- and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps after metathesis, the two ends swap their substituents. So, the new structure would have a double bond, but the substituents on each end would be different.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a new alkene where the substituents are CH(CH3)CH2CH3 and CH3.

But I'm not quite getting it. Let me think of metathesis as a [2+2] cycloaddition followed by breaking and re-forming. So, the catalyst brings two olefins together, but in this case, it's the same olefin undergoing ring-closing.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic alkene. Let me think about the number of carbons in the ring. The starting molecule is five carbons, so the ring would be five-membered.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. The substituents would be a methyl group and the rest would be CH2 groups.

Wait, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, when it forms a five-membered ring, the structure would have a double bond and a methyl substituent.

The ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3 perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentene with a methyl group on one carbon and a propyl group on another. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single cyclopentene isomer, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead forms a different alkene. Let me think. The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. After metathesis, possible alkenes could be 3-methylpent-2-ene or 2-methylpent-2-ene.

Wait, but can Grubbs cause that? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different alkenes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The starting molecule: 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

The possible sites for metathesis would be the existing double bond. But Grubbs can also induce cross-metathesis if another alkene is present, but in this case, it's just one. So, it's probably a ring-closing metathesis.

The product would be a cyclic alkene. The possible rings are 5-membered in this case.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

Let me try to count the substituents. The starting molecule has a methyl group on C3. So, when the ring forms, the substituents would be at certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single compound, so the number of products is 1, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible diastereomers, leading to two products.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible products are there (excluding ethene)".

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst could cause the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a racemic mixture, but the metathesis leads to the formation of both E and Z isomers, but since the starting material is racemic, maybe the product is a mixture of different stereoisomers.

But I'm not sure if the question counts stereoisomers as separate products.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different alkenes, leading to two possible products.

Wait, maybe the ring can form in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, but with a five-carbon chain, I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in two different positions, but I don't think so because the chain length is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst can lead to the formation of different ring sizes, but in this case, the molecule is five carbons, so only a five-membered ring is possible.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single compound, which is a cyclopentene derivative, so only one product.

But that contradicts the options given. The options suggest more than one product.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility of different stereoisomers.

Wait, the Grubbs catalyst is not chiral, so it won't induce asymmetry. But the starting material is racemic, which might lead to products that are also racemic.

But the question is about the number of possible products, which may include all possible stereoisomers and structural isomers.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to two different alkenes, each with their own possible stereoisomers.

Wait, so let me think: if the product is a cyclopentene with substituents, how many stereoisomers would that have?

If the cyclopentene has a substituent that can be on either side, leading to cis and trans isomers, then each would have two possibilities. But if the substituents are in symmetric positions, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structural isomer, so only one product is formed.

But the options don't include 1. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst can cause the metathesis to occur in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, considering that the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, perhaps the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to two different alkenes.

Let me think: the molecule has substituents beyond the double bond. Metathesis can occur either between the CH2=CH- and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, or maybe between other parts.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can occur at two different positions, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst can cause the ring to form in two different positions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products.

If the ring closes between the CH2=CH- and the CH2-CH3 end, the product would be a cyclopentene. Then, considering the substituents, how many different cyclopentene structures can form?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single cyclopentene with a methyl substituent and another substituent.

Wait, but how many different substituent arrangements are possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to two different products, each with a different substituent arrangement. So, number of products would be 2.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2.

But wait, another thought: the starting material is a racemic mixture. So when the metathesis occurs, perhaps each enantiomer leads to the same product, but if the product has a new chiral center, then each enantiomer would form a different product.

Wait, but the Grubbs catalyst is achiral, so if the product has a chiral center, the products would be racemic. But the question is about the number of possible products, regardless of their enantiomeric form.

Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer of the starting material leads to a different product.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because the catalyst is the same for both. So, perhaps the number of products is the same regardless of the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to two possible products, each with a different structure.

But then why would the options have 2 as an option? Looking back, option D is 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structural isomer, leading to only one product. But the options don't have 1.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis leads to two different products, each with their own set of stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene with substituents in different positions, leading to multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead forms an alkene in a different position, leading to two different products.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me think about the possible products.

The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When Grubbs is used, perhaps the product is a mixture of different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

So if there are two structural isomers, the number of products would be 2. So option D is 2.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to more than two products.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two double bonds? No, it's mono-olefin.

Wait, another thought: the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to two different alkenes. So, the number of products would be 2.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl group is attached to C3. Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis, which involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. In this case, the reaction likely proceeds via ring-closing metathesis, as the molecule is long enough to form a five-membered ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is a racemic mixture, meaning it contains both enantiomers of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl group is on C3.

2. **Grubbs Catalyst and Metathesis**:  
   Grubbs catalyst is achiral and facilitates the exchange of substituents across the double bond. In this case, the reaction likely involves ring-closing metathesis, where the CH₂=CH- group and the CH₂-CH₃ group at the ends of the molecule undergo metathesis to form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - The reaction can produce a cyclopentene derivative. Depending on how the substituents (the methyl group and other carbons) are arranged, different stereoisomers or structural isomers may form.  
   - However, the question specifies "possible products" excluding ethene, and the analysis suggests that the reaction primarily leads to a single cyclopentene product.  
   - The racemic nature of the starting material does not increase the number of distinct products, as the catalyst is achiral and does not induce new stereochemistry.

4. **Elimination of Other Options**:  
   - **Option A (4)** and **Option C (6)** are too high, as the reaction does not produce this many distinct products.  
   - **Option B (8)** is also incorrect, as it overestimates the number of possible outcomes.  
   - **Option D (2)** is plausible if the reaction produces two distinct products, such as two stereoisomers or structural isomers. However, the analysis suggests that only one product is formed.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst primarily produces one cyclopentene derivative. While there is some ambiguity in the reasoning, the most consistent answer based on the options provided is **Option D (2)**, assuming two possible products are formed under the reaction conditions.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Right, metathesis breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. The Grubbs catalyst, especially the first-generation one, is good for ring-closing metathesis and some cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's double-check. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on the third carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure is probably CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, wait. Let me think about the structure again.

Pent-1-ene is five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on C3. So structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, that's not possible because C3 would be the third carbon. Let me number: 1 2 3 4 5. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. 3-methyl would be a CH(CH3) group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it:

For pent-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3.

But when it's 3-methyl, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the methyl is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So correct structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, pent has five carbons.

So the correct structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Let me count: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 has five carbons? Let's count them as 1,2,3,4,5.

1: CH2= 
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH2
5: CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene, right. So the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Now, it's racemic, so it's a 50-50 mixture of two enantiomers. But wait, can 3-methylpent-1-ene have geometric isomerism? Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on either side are CH3 (on C2) and CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (on C1). Wait, actually, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So on C1, we have CH2 and on C2, CH. The groups on each carbon are CH2- and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, the substituents on each carbon: Carbon 1 has two CH2 groups (from CH2=CH-...), and carbon 2 has a CH group attached to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the structure as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 has a methyl group.

Now, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis. The reaction involves the breaking of the double bond and the redistribution of the substituents. Grubbs can induce different types of metathesis, such as ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis.

In this case, the starting molecule is a mono-olefin, so the metathesis would likely lead to a ring formation if possible, or perhaps other products. Alternatively, it might undergo a cross metathesis if there are other alkenes, but since it's just this one, perhaps it's a ring-closing reaction.

Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mono-olefin. So, when Grubbs is used, it can cause the olefin to undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let me think: Grubbs catalyst can facilitate the exchange of substituents across the double bond, leading to new alkenes.

But wait, another possibility is that the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a ring. Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's imagine the two ends of the molecule (the CH2=CH- and the CH2-CH3) reacting. If the Grubbs catalyst facilitates a metathesis between the two ends, perhaps forming a ring.

But wait, let me think about the possible products. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross metathesis, but without another alkene, that's not possible. So more likely, it's a ring-closing metathesis.

Let me imagine that the ends of the molecule undergo metathesis. So, the CH2=CH- group and the CH2-CH3 group could exchange. So, the double bond would break, and the two ends would swap partners.

So, the original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, and then recombining. The possible products would form a ring if the molecule is long enough. Let me count the carbons between the ends for possible ring size.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The other end is CH2-CH3. So, if a ring forms, how many atoms would the ring have?

The chain from C1 to the end is: C1 (CH2-), C2 (CH-), C3 (CH(CH3)-), C4 (CH2-), C5 (CH3). Wait, but actually, the chain is from the double bond end (C1 and C2) to the other end (C5). So, the distance is four carbons apart. Let's see: the double bond is between C1 and C2. The other end is C5. So, the chain from C2 to C5 is three carbons (C3, C4, C5). So, if the catalyst causes a metathesis between the two ends, the ring formed would be a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe. Let's see: when the CH2=CH- part and the CH2-CH3 part undergo metathesis, the double bond would form a new ring. So, the structure would be a cyclopentane derivative.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a bicyclic structure? Or maybe a five-membered ring. Let me draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to think about the possible alkenes formed. The metathesis can produce different alkenes, so the question is about how many different products are possible.

Wait, the question specifies "excluding ethene," so any ethene produced would not count. But in a ring-closing metathesis, ethene might be a byproduct. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to undergo a cross metathesis with itself, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, another approach: The Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene, and it can facilitate the exchange of substituents across the double bond. So, the process can lead to different alkenes based on how the substituents rearrange.

Let me think about the structure. The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Structure: CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3.

When Grubbs is added, it can cause the olefin to undergo metathesis. The possible products would be different alkenes. But considering it's a racemic mixture, how does that affect the outcome?

Wait, Grubbs is a chiral catalyst? No, wait, Grubbs catalyst is typically achiral. So, it would not induce asymmetry in the product beyond what is present in the starting material.

Wait, wait, the starting material is racemic, meaning that it's a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. But I'm not sure if the chirality affects the number of products.

Wait, in this case, the molecule is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. When Grubbs catalyst is used, it can cause the olefin to form a new double bond by breaking the existing one and rearranging.

But perhaps more importantly, since the starting molecule is a racemic mixture, the metathesis could lead to both possible diastereomers or enantiomers, but since the catalyst is achiral, perhaps the products would also be a racemic mixture if any new chiral centers are formed.

Wait, but in this problem, we are just considering the number of different possible products, regardless of their stereochemistry. Or perhaps the question counts stereoisomers as separate products.

Wait, the question asks for the number of possible products, so I need to consider all possible structures, including stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because there are multiple sites where metathesis can occur.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting alkene can undergo different metathesis pathways. For example, the double bond could break in different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopentene or other ring structures, or maybe cross metathesis with itself, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all possible products that can form. Let me think about possible metathesis products.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two ends of the molecule would meet, forming a ring and releasing ethylene. So, in this case, the molecule has five carbons with a double bond at the first position.

If the ends are the CH2=CH and the CH2CH3 parts, then connecting those could form a ring. Let's imagine the double bond breaking and the two ends (CH2- and CH3) recombining.

Wait, perhaps the chain is longer. Let me count the carbons between the double bond ends.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the chain from the double bond (C1 and C2) to the end (C5) is four carbons long (C3 and C4 are in between). So, if the Grubbs catalyst causes the two ends to form a ring, the ring size would depend on where the metathesis occurs.

Wait, the possible rings that can form: if the metathesis occurs between C1 and C5, the ring would have four members (since there are four carbons between the ends, but including the double bond, perhaps I'm getting this wrong).

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formed would have five members. Let me think: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the metathesis occurs between the CH2=CH and the CH2-CH3 ends, the ring would be a five-membered ring: the new double bond would be between C1 and C5, but that doesn't make sense because that's a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the two ends (CH2=CH and CH2CH3) would form a new double bond, creating a ring.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible new alkenes formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis will break the double bond and form a new one. So, the original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the possible new alkenes would be:

1. CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with the new double bond somewhere else. Wait, no, metathesis doesn't form single bonds; it swaps substituents.

Wait, metathesis cleaves the double bond and recombines the substituents. So, for each olefin, the catalyst can exchange the groups on each end.

So, the general reaction is R1-R2 double bond R3-R4 → R1-R4 double bond R2-R3, along with the exchange of substituents.

So, in this case, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's denote this as R1=CH2-, R2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the possible products. So, the Grubbs catalyst would allow the olefin to undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let's see:

The molecule is long enough to form a five-membered ring. The structure would be:

After metathesis, the double bond would be between C3 and C4 perhaps, but wait, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when Grubbs is used on a mono-olefin, it can cause ring-closing metathesis if the molecule is long enough. Let me think about the chain length. The molecule here is five carbons, so the end groups are CH2=CH- and CH2-CH3.

If the metathesis occurs between the CH2=CH group and the CH2-CH3 group, the molecule would form a ring. The new double bond would be between C1 and C5. Wait, that would form a five-membered ring with a double bond, making it a cyclopentene derivative.

So, the product would be cyclopentene with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents would be arranged differently. Let me visualize:

The original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the ends (CH2=CH- and -CH2-CH3) undergo metathesis, they could form a ring. The new structure would be a cycloalkene, specifically a cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene with a methyl group and another substituent. So, the structure would be:

The ring would be five-membered, with a double bond. Let me think about the substituents. The original groups on each end are CH2 and CH3. So, after metathesis, the ring would have substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the process leads to the formation of two different alkenes. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Another possibility is that the Grubbs catalyst could cause the olefin to form a new alkene by rearrangement, leading to different possible alkenes. Let me think about all possible alkenes that could form.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. After metathesis, the possible alkenes would depend on the positions where the double bonds can form.

The molecule has five carbons. Possible alkenes after metathesis could be 2-methylpent-2-ene, maybe other isomers.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible alkenes depends on the possible positions of the double bonds that can form.

Wait, but Grubbs tends to favor the formation of more substituted alkenes, due to the stability of the transition state.

Alternatively, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst tends to form the most stable rings, which are typically five or six-membered rings.

So, in this case, the molecule is five carbons, so a five-membered ring would be formed.

Wait, but how does that translate into the structure of the product? The product would be a cyclic alkene with substituents.

Wait, let's try to draw it.

Original structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the double bond is between C1 and C5, but that's not possible since the molecule is linear. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a ring where the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new alkene in a different position, leading to different structural isomers.

Wait, but without considering stereochemistry, perhaps the number of possible structural isomers is limited.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When Grubbs catalyst is used, the possible products are the result of the olefin metathesis, which can lead to different alkenes.

The reaction could produce two different alkenes, each as a pair of enantiomers. But since the starting material is racemic, how does that affect the products?

Wait, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to products that are themselves racemic, but the problem is about the number of possible products, not considering stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait, the question says 'how many possible products are there (excluding ethene)'.

So, perhaps the major product is a single cycloalkene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to two different products. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting molecule is a mono-olefin, so the Grubbs catalyst will facilitate a ring-closing metathesis, resulting in a cyclic alkene. So the product would be a single structure, but perhaps if there are multiple possible ring sizes, but in this case, the molecule is five carbons, so it can only form a five-membered ring.

Wait, but maybe the ring can form in different ways, leading to different substituents.

Wait, maybe the substituents could be arranged in different positions, leading to different isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is unique, so the number of products is 1, but that's not one of the options. The options are 4, 8, 6, or 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the starting material can undergo more than one type of metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to shift, leading to different alkenes. So, the reaction can produce multiple alkenes.

Wait, let me think: The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When treated with Grubbs, the possible products could be different alkenes.

The possible alkenes that can form:

1. 2-methylpent-2-ene.

2. 3-methylpent-2-ene.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about possible metathesis products.

In olefin metathesis, the catalyst can cause the breaking and reforming of the double bond in a way that swaps the substituents on each carbon.

So, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In metathesis, the two R groups on each side of the double bond can exchange. So, the left side is CH2- and the right side is CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

After metathesis, the product could be CH2-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but wait, that's not possible because that would form a single bond, but metathesis forms new double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis forms a new double bond elsewhere. Let me think about possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two new alkenes: one where the double bond is between C1 and C2 (original), and another where the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, but that's not correct because metathesis doesn't just shift the double bond; it breaks and reforms it.

Wait, perhaps the process is more about the redistribution of substituents. So, for the starting molecule, the groups on each end of the double bond are CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but in metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and allow the groups to exchange. So, the new products would have the substituents swapped.

But wait, in this case, the groups on the double bond are CH2- and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps after metathesis, the two ends swap their substituents. So, the new structure would have a double bond, but the substituents on each end would be different.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a new alkene where the substituents are CH(CH3)CH2CH3 and CH3.

But I'm not quite getting it. Let me think of metathesis as a [2+2] cycloaddition followed by breaking and re-forming. So, the catalyst brings two olefins together, but in this case, it's the same olefin undergoing ring-closing.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic alkene. Let me think about the number of carbons in the ring. The starting molecule is five carbons, so the ring would be five-membered.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. The substituents would be a methyl group and the rest would be CH2 groups.

Wait, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, when it forms a five-membered ring, the structure would have a double bond and a methyl substituent.

The ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3 perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentene with a methyl group on one carbon and a propyl group on another. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single cyclopentene isomer, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead forms a different alkene. Let me think. The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. After metathesis, possible alkenes could be 3-methylpent-2-ene or 2-methylpent-2-ene.

Wait, but can Grubbs cause that? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different alkenes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The starting molecule: 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

The possible sites for metathesis would be the existing double bond. But Grubbs can also induce cross-metathesis if another alkene is present, but in this case, it's just one. So, it's probably a ring-closing metathesis.

The product would be a cyclic alkene. The possible rings are 5-membered in this case.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

Let me try to count the substituents. The starting molecule has a methyl group on C3. So, when the ring forms, the substituents would be at certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single compound, so the number of products is 1, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible diastereomers, leading to two products.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible products are there (excluding ethene)".

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst could cause the formation of two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a racemic mixture, but the metathesis leads to the formation of both E and Z isomers, but since the starting material is racemic, maybe the product is a mixture of different stereoisomers.

But I'm not sure if the question counts stereoisomers as separate products.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different alkenes, leading to two possible products.

Wait, maybe the ring can form in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, but with a five-carbon chain, I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in two different positions, but I don't think so because the chain length is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst can lead to the formation of different ring sizes, but in this case, the molecule is five carbons, so only a five-membered ring is possible.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single compound, which is a cyclopentene derivative, so only one product.

But that contradicts the options given. The options suggest more than one product.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility of different stereoisomers.

Wait, the Grubbs catalyst is not chiral, so it won't induce asymmetry. But the starting material is racemic, which might lead to products that are also racemic.

But the question is about the number of possible products, which may include all possible stereoisomers and structural isomers.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to two different alkenes, each with their own possible stereoisomers.

Wait, so let me think: if the product is a cyclopentene with substituents, how many stereoisomers would that have?

If the cyclopentene has a substituent that can be on either side, leading to cis and trans isomers, then each would have two possibilities. But if the substituents are in symmetric positions, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structural isomer, so only one product is formed.

But the options don't include 1. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst can cause the metathesis to occur in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, considering that the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, perhaps the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to two different alkenes.

Let me think: the molecule has substituents beyond the double bond. Metathesis can occur either between the CH2=CH- and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, or maybe between other parts.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can occur at two different positions, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst can cause the ring to form in two different positions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products.

If the ring closes between the CH2=CH- and the CH2-CH3 end, the product would be a cyclopentene. Then, considering the substituents, how many different cyclopentene structures can form?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single cyclopentene with a methyl substituent and another substituent.

Wait, but how many different substituent arrangements are possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to two different products, each with a different substituent arrangement. So, number of products would be 2.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2.

But wait, another thought: the starting material is a racemic mixture. So when the metathesis occurs, perhaps each enantiomer leads to the same product, but if the product has a new chiral center, then each enantiomer would form a different product.

Wait, but the Grubbs catalyst is achiral, so if the product has a chiral center, the products would be racemic. But the question is about the number of possible products, regardless of their enantiomeric form.

Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer of the starting material leads to a different product.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because the catalyst is the same for both. So, perhaps the number of products is the same regardless of the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to two possible products, each with a different structure.

But then why would the options have 2 as an option? Looking back, option D is 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structural isomer, leading to only one product. But the options don't have 1.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis leads to two different products, each with their own set of stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene with substituents in different positions, leading to multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead forms an alkene in a different position, leading to two different products.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me think about the possible products.

The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When Grubbs is used, perhaps the product is a mixture of different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

So if there are two structural isomers, the number of products would be 2. So option D is 2.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to more than two products.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two double bonds? No, it's mono-olefin.

Wait, another thought: the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to two different alkenes. So, the number of products would be 2.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D) 2.


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl group is attached to C3. Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis, which involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. In this case, the reaction likely proceeds via ring-closing metathesis, as the molecule is long enough to form a five-membered ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is a racemic mixture, meaning it contains both enantiomers of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl group is on C3.

2. **Grubbs Catalyst and Metathesis**:  
   Grubbs catalyst is achiral and facilitates the exchange of substituents across the double bond. In this case, the reaction likely involves ring-closing metathesis, where the CH₂=CH- group and the CH₂-CH₃ group at the ends of the molecule undergo metathesis to form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - The reaction can produce a cyclopentene derivative. Depending on how the substituents (the methyl group and other carbons) are arranged, different stereoisomers or structural isomers may form.  
   - However, the question specifies "possible products" excluding ethene, and the analysis suggests that the reaction primarily leads to a single cyclopentene product.  
   - The racemic nature of the starting material does not increase the number of distinct products, as the catalyst is achiral and does not induce new stereochemistry.

4. **Elimination of Other Options**:  
   - **Option A (4)** and **Option C (6)** are too high, as the reaction does not produce this many distinct products.  
   - **Option B (8)** is also incorrect, as it overestimates the number of possible outcomes.  
   - **Option D (2)** is plausible if the reaction produces two distinct products, such as two stereoisomers or structural isomers. However, the analysis suggests that only one product is formed.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst primarily produces one cyclopentene derivative. While there is some ambiguity in the reasoning, the most consistent answer based on the options provided is **Option D (2)**, assuming two possible products are formed under the reaction conditions.

Answer: D
