Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Hmm, let's see. So Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But even then, some gas molecules are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them, so he knows they're present.

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and volume, right? I remember that the mean free path (λ) is given by λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule diameter, and p is pressure. But wait, if the pressure is really low, the mean free path should be longer because the molecules don't hit each other as often.

So, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, what's the relationship between λ2 and λ1? The temperature is the same, so T is constant. Oh, but wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The gas molecules might interact with the electrons, which could cause scattering.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are energetic. At 1000 kV, that's a lot of energy. High-energy electrons can cause various effects like ionization and excitation of the gas molecules. So maybe the gas starts to act differently. Could this affect the mean free path?

In the initial state without the electron beam, the mean free path λ1 is determined by the gas's thermal motion and the vacuum conditions. But when the electrons are firing, the gas molecules might get charged. If the electrons collide with the gas molecules, the molecules might become ionized. Charged particles in a vacuum behave differently. They might stick to the walls of the compartment or get accelerated by the electric fields, but more importantly, their interactions with each other and the beam would change.

Wait, but how does ionization affect the mean free path? If gas molecules become ions (charged), their effective diameter might change. Also, the way they scatter from each other or from the beam changes because the Coulomb forces come into play. But wait, in a vacuum, collisions between charged particles are more likely because they attract or repel each other. So the mean free path would decrease because they collide more frequently.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the gas is ionized, the ions might have different interaction cross-sections. For instance, ionized particles can have larger effective sizes because of their electron charge distribution. This would increase the cross-section, leading to more frequent collisions, thereby reducing the mean free path.

Alternatively, if the gas is neutral, the main collisions are due to kinetic (elastic) interactions. When the gas is ionized, the ions could either stick to the walls (pumping more effectively) or collide more. But in this case, Mike is probably observing the change in electron scattering, which suggests that the gas is causing more scattering events.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves, or the mean free path of the electrons? Wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Because Mike determined λ1 based on gas properties, and then when the electron beam is on, he observes λ2 for the gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas ionization. Ionized gas (plasma) behaves differently. Charged particles in the gas might have different collision rates. But wait, in a plasma, the mean free path could be longer or shorter? I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, think about electron scattering. The electrons in the beam are high-energy and can cause the gas molecules to ionize. Now, when the gas is ionized, the mean free path for the gas ions or electrons might change.

But wait, the mean free path is for the gas molecules. So if the gas becomes ionized, the neutral molecules are less, so collisions between them are less. But wait, the ions might interact more with each other or with the electrons. Hmm, but the mean free path is for each gas molecule. So if the gas is neutral, λ1 is based on neutral molecules. When the beam is on, and the gas is ionized, perhaps the mean free path for the ions is different.

Wait, but the question says that Mike is observing the mean free path based on electron scattering. So maybe he's measuring the electron's mean free path, not the gas's? Or maybe the gas's mean free path changes because of the electron beam.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up. But the temperature is the same, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another angle. The initial mean free path λ1 is for the gas molecules when the system is at rest (ultra-high vacuum). When the electron beam starts, the beam might cause the gas molecules to be excited or ionized. So, the gas is now a plasma.

In a plasma, the mean free path can be different. For electrons in a plasma, the mean free path is determined by collisions with ions or other electrons. In a high-energy beam scenario, the electrons could have a longer mean free path because they're moving so fast that they don't collide as much. But wait, that's the electrons. The question is about the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, when the gas becomes ionized, the effective pressure might change. Ions might have different collision properties. For example, their cross-section for collision could be larger, so the mean free path λ decreases. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think about the physics. In a vacuum, the main loss mechanism for the electron beam is scattering by gas molecules. The mean free path for the electrons is the average distance they travel before scattering. But Mike is talking about the gas's mean free path, not the electrons'.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the scenario. Initially, the gas is neutral, and Mike measures λ1 as the mean free path for the gas molecules. Then, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized, so now they carry a charge.

Charged particles (ions) in a vacuum can behave differently. In an ultra-high vacuum, charged particles may stick to the walls of the compartment because there's very little gas to support them. So, if the gas becomes ionized, the ions may quickly reach the walls, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment.

If the number of gas molecules decreases because they are sticking to the walls, what happens to the mean free path λ? Well, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure (or density) of the gas. So if the pressure effectively drops (because ions are being pumped out), the mean free path λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-low. So when the gas becomes ionized, the ions could either stay in the gas phase or be pumped away. If the ionized gas is more likely to stick to the walls (due to lower pressure allowing them to hit the walls more frequently), then the number of gas molecules (including ions) would decrease. This would cause the effective pressure to drop, increasing the mean free path.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1. Then, looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22... Hmm, but why 1.22? That's the factor for de Broglie wavelength or something else?

Wait, another approach. The initial mean free path λ1 is for neutral gas. When the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized. Ions have different properties. The cross-section for collisions between ions and the walls could be larger, but perhaps the cross-section for collisions between ions themselves is different.

Alternatively, in high vacuum, the dominant loss mechanism for ions is due to the walls because the mean free path for ions is longer than that of neutrals, but wait, no. Let me think about it: in a vacuum, a neutral molecule's mean free path is determined by collisions with other molecules. For ions, in a vacuum without a strong electric field, the mean free path would be determined by collisions with the walls. But the walls are at a lower potential, so ions would be attracted and hit the walls more quickly.

So, the mean free path for ions would be shorter than that for neutral molecules because they have a higher chance of hitting the walls. Wait, no, the mean free path is the average distance between collisions. For ions, the collision rate would be higher if the compartment is smaller, but in this case, the compartment's volume hasn't changed.

But wait, if the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, their number in the gas phase would decrease. So the pressure effectively drops, which increases the mean free path. So the gas molecules (including ions) have a longer mean free path than before.

Wait, but Mike is measuring the mean free path based on electron scattering. So perhaps the electron's mean free path is what's being considered. Oh, that's a different approach.

The electron's mean free path would be the distance they travel before scattering. In the initial state (without the beam), the electron's mean free path would be much shorter because they're not moving. But when the beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The presence of gas molecules causes scattering. So the electron's mean free path is inversely proportional to the scattering rate.

But in reality, when the electron beam is on, the gas is bombarded by high-energy electrons, which can cause ionization. So the gas becomes charged. So, the mean free path for the electrons would change based on the gas's ionization state.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the electrons in the beam are more likely to interact with the ions, which have a different cross-section. Maybe the cross-section for electron-ion scattering is larger than for electron-neutral scattering. So the electron's mean free path would be shorter because they're scattering more often.

But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. So perhaps we should think about the gas's own mean free path. If the gas is ionized, the neutral molecules have decreased in number, but the ions might have a different mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas has a lower effective pressure since the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, thereby reducing the number of particles. So the mean free path for the gas would be longer.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules (as per Mike's initial calculation) is λ1, and upon electron beam initiation, it becomes λ2. So the question is: how does λ2 compare to λ1?

If the presence of the electron beam leads to ionization of the gas, which makes the gas molecules stick to the walls more, then the effective pressure decreases. Because some gas molecules are now stuck on the walls as ions, the number of free gas particles in the compartment decreases. Since mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure (higher pressure means more particles, shorter mean free path), a lower effective pressure would mean a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, which is a significant increase. Option C says λ2 < λ1 which would be a decrease.

So if the mean free path increases, then λ2 > λ1. The possible options are A, B, D.

But why would λ2 be equal to 1.22 times λ1? 1.22 is approximately sqrt(1.5), but I'm not sure what factor that comes from. Alternatively, maybe it's the factor when considering the change in cross-section due to ionization.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the collision cross-section increases, causing the mean free path to decrease. Wait, if the cross-section increases, the mean free path (λ) would decrease, because λ is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section.

So, if gas is ionized, and the cross-section for collisions increases, then λ would decrease. So λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But earlier, I thought that ionization would cause the gas to stick to the walls, thus reducing the pressure, which would lead to a longer mean free path.

Hmm. Now I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify.

The mean free path for gas molecules is given by λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if either n decreases or σ increases, λ increases.

If the gas is ionized, n could decrease because some ions stick to the walls. So n goes down, causing λ to go up.

But σ could also change. For charged particles, the cross-section for collisions (elastic or inelastic) might be larger because the ions have a larger effective size (due to their charge cloud), leading to more frequent collisions. So σ increases, making λ decrease.

So which effect dominates? If ionization leads to a decrease in n, but an increase in σ, which effect is stronger?

In a high vacuum, where n is very low, the effect of n decreasing might be minor. Because even if a fraction of the gas sticks to the walls, the total number of free particles is still very low. But the cross-section increase could be more significant.

Wait, but when the gas is ionized, more of the molecules are ions. So the number density of neutral gas molecules is lower. Let's say that the ionization fraction is f, then n = n0 (1-f), where n0 is the original number density. So if f is 0.5, n becomes half.

But the cross-section between ions and other ions or neutrals might be higher. Suppose σ' = 2σ. Then, the new mean free path λ' = 1/(n σ') = 1/(n0*(1-f)*2σ) ) = (1/(n0 σ)) ) * 1/(2(1-f)) ) = λ1 (1/(2(1-f)) )

Wait, so if f is 0.5, then (1-f)=0.5, so λ' is λ1/(1) → λ' = λ1/(2 * 0.5) )= λ1/(1) → same as λ1. Hmm, but that's a specific case. It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the gas is ionized, making the molecules more likely to stick to the walls, thereby reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. Thus, the pressure effectively decreases, leading to an increase in the mean free path.

In that case, λ2 > λ1. So which option fits that? Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

But why 1.22? Hmm, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2) * something. Alternatively, perhaps it's the factor when considering the change in the effective cross-section due to ionization.

Wait, another approach: when the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section for scattering increases. For example, if the gas is neutral, the cross-section is σ. When ionized, it's σ', which is larger than σ. So λ = 1/(n σ') < 1/(n σ) = λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but if n decreases because some ions are stuck on the walls, then n is less. The net effect depends on how n and σ change.

Let me model this mathematically. Let's suppose that some fraction of the gas is ionized, so the number density is n = n0 (1 - f), where f is the ionization fraction.

The cross-section for scattering increases to σ' = k σ, where k >1. Then, the new mean free path is λ' = 1/(n σ') = 1/(n0 (1-f) k σ) ) = (1/(n0 σ)) * 1/(k (1-f)) ) = λ1 * 1/(k (1-f)).

If k*(1-f) >1, then λ' < λ1.

If k*(1-f) <1, then λ' > λ1.

It depends on the values of k and f. Without knowing exact values, it's hard to say. But in the scenario, the presence of the electron beam is causing ionization, so f is significant.

In an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already long. If the gas is ionized, the mean free path could either increase or decrease, depending on which effect dominates.

Wait, but the question states that Mike accurately determined λ1. Then, upon starting the beam, he found λ2. So he's measuring the mean free path of the gas, perhaps through some scattering method.

Another possibility is that when the beam is on, the gas is better pumped out because the ions are more easily captured by the walls. So the effective pressure is lower, leading to a longer mean free path.

In that case, λ2 > λ1. So looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, option C is λ2 < λ1.

But why would it be at least 1.22 times longer? Maybe because the gas is ionized and the cross-section for collisions is larger.

Wait, no, if the cross-section increases, λ decreases. But if the pumping is more efficient, n decreases, leading to λ increasing.

So perhaps the main effect is that the number of gas particles in the compartment decreases because the ions are being lost to the walls. So n is lower, leading to a longer λ.

In that case, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

But why 1.22? Maybe because the effective cross-section increases due to ionization, but the main effect is that the number of particles (n) decreases. Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation (λ1) didn't account for the presence of the electron beam, which affects the gas dynamics.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam introduces additional effects, like heating, which could cause the gas to expand, but the temperature is stated to remain the same.

Wait, the question says the sample compartment temperature remained the same, so that rules out temperature changes affecting λ. So the only factors are related to the gas state.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path is also affected by the pressure. Since the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be ionized, which are then more likely to adhere to the walls. So the effective pressure in the compartment is lower than before. Lower pressure leads to a longer mean free path.

So λ2 is longer than λ1. Thus, λ2 > λ1. Among the options, that's either option A or D. But option A says λ2 >= 1.22 *λ1, and D says λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1.

So why would λ2 be at least 1.22 times longer? Maybe because the ionization changes the collision cross-section in a way that the mean free path increases by a factor of 1.22.

Alternatively, perhaps 1.22 is a standard factor when considering the transition from neutral to ionized gas, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The original mean free path is for neutral gas, and when the gas is ionized, the effective collision cross-section increases. But if the number density decreases more significantly (due to sticking to walls), the overall effect could be an increase in λ2.

Assuming that the number density decreases by a factor x and the cross-section increases by a factor y. Then λ2 = λ1 * (x/y). If x/y >1, then λ2>λ1.

But without knowing x and y, it's hard to say. However, in the options, the only one that suggests λ2 is larger than λ1 is option A and D (for A and D, λ2 is larger). So the question is, is it larger than 1.22 times, or just more than λ1 but less than 1.22 times.

Hmm. Another approach: I recall that in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer than in a neutral gas because, for electrons, the mean free path is determined by collisions with ions, which, in certain conditions, can be less frequent than collisions in neutral gas. Wait, but that's for electrons in a plasma.

Wait, no. Let me think. In a plasma, the electrons are already moving freely, so their mean free path is longer. But for ions, their mean free path might be shorter due to Coulomb collisions.

But Mike is measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules. So if they're neutral, λ1 is based on their collisions. If they're ionized, their collisions might change.

Wait, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions between molecules is larger, so the mean free path decreases. But if ionization leads to more loss (molecules sticking to walls), the number density decreases, which would increase the mean free path. So it's a trade-off.

But which effect is stronger? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more likely that the cross-section change has a bigger impact. If the cross-section increases, then λ decreases, so λ2 < λ1 (option C). But earlier reasoning suggested the opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the mean free path of the gas's neutral molecules remains λ1, but the ionized gas has a different mean free path. But the question says Mike is talking about the same gas, just under the influence of the beam.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam's presence causes gas molecules to be ionized, and thus, their mean free path decreases. Because charged particles (ions) would scatter more due to Coulomb forces, so their mean free path is shorter.

But wait, if the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, their mean free path would be shorter because they collide with the walls more often. So λ2 would be shorter than λ1.

Wait, but then why would Mike observe λ2 as the mean free path? Because the beam is on, and he's measuring scattering, which is affected by the gas's mean free path.

So if the gas's mean free path is shorter, there are more collisions, so more scattering. So the electron beam would be more scattered, which would imply that Mike's measurement indicates a shorter mean free path.

In that case, λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But earlier I thought that ionization reduces the number of gas molecules, leading to longer λ. But perhaps that's not the case because the scattering is measured based on electron interactions, which could be more frequent if the gas's cross-section is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the gas's temperature, but the question states that the temperature remains the same.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Let's think about what the mean free path represents in the context of electron microscopy.

In electron microscopy, the mean free path is a critical parameter because it determines how far the electrons travel before scattering. A longer mean free path allows the electrons to travel farther without scattering, which is good for imaging. But in this question, Mike is observing the gas's mean free path, not the electrons'.

Wait, but Mike is using the electron beam to observe the scattering. So perhaps he's indirectly measuring the gas's mean free path based on the scattering rate.

If the gas's mean free path is shorter, that implies more frequent collisions, leading to more scattering, which the beam would detect. So if λ2 is shorter, the gas is more scattering, hence more scattering events detected.

So, how does the gas's mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

If the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path could be shorter because the cross-section for collisions is higher. So λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But earlier I considered that the number density might decrease, leading to longer λ. But that's a competing effect.

Wait, perhaps the dominant effect here is the change in collision cross-section due to ionization. So, the collision cross-section σ increases, leading to a shorter mean free path λ, so λ2 < λ1.

So the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the opposite could be true.

Let me look for another angle. The problem says that when the electron beam is on, Mike finds that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but λ2. How does the electron beam affect the gas? It could cause ionization, which might change the gas's properties.

In a neutral gas, the mean free path is determined by elastic collisions between molecules. In an ionized gas (plasma), collisions can be between ions, electrons, and neutral atoms. The cross-sections for these collisions are different. For example, the cross-section for electron-ion collisions is much larger than for neutral-neutral collisions because of the electric charges.

So, in the ionized state, the effective cross-section for collisions increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. Thus, λ2 < λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum state in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecule interactions. He calculated the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1 under these conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a new mean free path, λ2, which deviated from λ1.

The mean free path (λ) is influenced by factors such as the number density of gas molecules (n), the collision cross-section (σ), and the effective pressure. Initially, λ1 was determined under ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the electron beam is activated, high-energy electrons interact with the gas molecules, causing ionization. Ionization alters the gas's properties:

1. **Ionization Effects**: Ionized gas molecules (ions) have different collision dynamics compared to neutral molecules. The collision cross-section (σ) increases due to the presence of charged particles, as Coulomb forces dominate. This increase in σ leads to more frequent collisions, reducing the mean free path.

2. **Number Density (n)**: While ionization may reduce the number density of neutral gas molecules (as some ions stick to the walls), this effect is secondary to the increase in collision cross-section. The dominant factor is the change in σ, which significantly impacts the mean free path.

3. **Temperature**: The temperature of the sample compartment remains constant, so thermal effects do not influence the comparison between λ1 and λ2.

Given these considerations, the ionization of gas molecules caused by the electron beam increases the collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path (λ2 < λ1). Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1.
