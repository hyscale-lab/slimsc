Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star that's being studied by astronomers. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. Let's unpack this. So, the key here is understanding how the ratio of populations in two energy levels changes with temperature. Since the photosphere is in LTE, I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, with E2 > E1.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio of n2 to n1 depends on the temperature. Let's denote this ratio as R = n2/n1. Without spots, the effective temperature is higher (6000 K), and when spots are present, it's lower (5500 K). But wait, the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff decreases, so the star is cooler overall. But how does that affect the energy levels of Ti?

Wait, actually, the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff becomes 5500K. So the photosphere as a whole is now at a lower temperature. So the Ti atoms in the photosphere are in a lower temperature environment when spots are present.

So the ratio R (n2/n1) will change based on the temperature. Let's think about how R changes when T changes. The exponential term is the key here. When the temperature increases, the exponential term becomes less negative, which means R increases. So, when the star is hotter (no spots), R should be higher than when it's cooler (spots present). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That makes sense because the temperature is lower, so R would decrease.

So when there are no spots (T=6000 K), R is higher, and when there are spots (T=5500 K), R is lower. The question is asking for the factor by which R changes. That is, factor = R_no_spots / R_spots.

Wait, no. Wait the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R_spots = R(T=5500 K) is lower than R_no_spots = R(T=6000 K). So the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots.

So, I need to compute the ratio of R at 6000K to R at 5500K.

But let's get the exact equation. The ratio R is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether g2 and g1 change. Oh, I think in this case, we can assume that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same regardless of the star's temperature. Because g depends on the quantum states, not the temperature. So, g2/g1 is a constant, let's call it 'Q'. So R = Q * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, the ratio R when there are no spots is R0 = Q * exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )

And when there are spots, it's R1 = Q * exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

So the factor is R0/R1 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Simplify this:

R0/R1 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract exponents.

Wait, because:

[exp(a)] / [exp(b)] = exp(a - b)

So in this case, a = -ΔE/(k*6000), and b = -ΔE/(k*5500)

So:

a - b = [ -ΔE/(6000k) ] - [ -ΔE/(5500k) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So R0/R1 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Wait, but 1/5500 is bigger than 1/6000, so the exponent is positive. So exp of a positive number, which is greater than 1. So R0 is bigger than R1, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

But how do I find ΔE? The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon emitted or absorbed during the transition.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. Since the transition is between two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE is equal to the photon's energy.

So, ΔE = hc / λ

But wait, photons emitted when an electron drops from higher to lower energy have energy E = ΔE. So that's correct.

So, let's compute ΔE.

h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 2.99792458e8 m/s

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, plugging in:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 2.998e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Let me compute that:

First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = approx 1.985e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE = 1.985e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx (1.985 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J

1.985 / 1.448 ≈ 1.371

So ΔE ≈ 1.371e-18 J per photon.

But wait, each photon's energy is ΔE. So the energy per photon is 1.371e-18 J.

But wait, when calculating the exponent in the Boltzmann equation, it's ΔE/(k T), so let's compute that.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K

So ΔE/(k T) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T )

Compute this for each T.

Wait, but since we have two temperatures, 6000 K and 5500 K, we can compute the value for each.

Wait, but in the exponent, we have (ΔE / (k T)).

Wait, but let me compute x = ΔE/(k T) for T=6000 and T=5500.

So:

x6000 = (1.371e-18) / (1.38e-23 * 6000 )

Compute denominator first: 1.38e-23 *6e3 = 8.28e-20

So x6000 = (1.371e-18) / (8.28e-20) = approx (1.371 / 8.28) * 1e2 ≈ (0.1655) * 100 ≈ 16.55

Similarly, x5500:

x5500 = (1.371e-18) / (1.38e-23 *5500 )

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20

x5500 = (1.371e-18)/(7.59e-20) = (1.371 /7.59) * 1e2 ≈ 0.1807 *100 ≈ 18.07

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, 1.371e-18 divided by 7.59e-20 is (1.371 /7.59) * 1e2. Let me compute 1.371 /7.59.

7.59 goes into 1.371 approximately 0.18 times, so 0.18 times 100 is 18. So x5500 is approximately 18.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.371e-18 / 7.59e-20 = (1.371 / 7.59) * 1e2

Calculating 1.371 / 7.59:

7.59 is about 7.59. Let me do 1.371 ÷7.59.

7.59 * 0.18 is about 1.3662, which is close to 1.371. So approximately 0.18, so x5500≈18.

Similarly, x6000 is (1.371e-18)/(8.28e-20) = (1.371/8.28) *1e2.

1.371 /8.28 is approximately 0.1655. So x6000 ≈16.55.

Wait, but wait, actually, the exponent in the ratio R0/R1 is (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this term directly.

So, let me compute the term inside the exponent:

(ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ]

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Compute 1/5500 ≈1.818e-4

1/6000≈1.667e-4

Difference: (1.818e-4 -1.667e-4)= 0.151e-4=1.51e-5.

So,

(ΔE/(k)) * (1.51e-5) 

We have ΔE=1.371e-18 J.

So,

(1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * 1.51e-5 = 

First, compute 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approx 9.935e4 = 9.935e4 K.

Wait, because J/(J/K) = K. So 1.371e-18 /1.38e-23 = (1.371/1.38) * 1e5 = approx 0.993 *1e5 ≈99300 K.

Then multiply by 1.51e-5:

99300 * 1.51e-5 = 99300 * 0.0000151 ≈

Let me compute 99300 *0.0000151.

Multiply 99300 by 1.51e-5.

99300 = 9.93e4.

9.93e4 * 1.51e-5 = 9.93 *1.51 * 1e-1 = (approx 15.00) *0.1 = 1.5.

Wait, 9.93 *1.51: let's compute that.

1.51 *10 is 15.1, but since it's 9.93, maybe 15.1 * (993/1000) ≈15.1 *0.993 ≈15.0.

So 9.93 *1.51 ≈15.02

So 15.02 * 1e-1 = 1.502.

So the exponent is approximately 1.502.

Wait, so the exponent is about 1.5. So the factor R0/R1 is exp(1.5) ≈4.48.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because that's a crucial step.

So:

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Let me calculate more accurately.

1/5500 = (1/5500) = (approx) 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So 1.5151e-5.

Compute (ΔE)/(k) * (1.5151e-5).

ΔE is 1.371e-18 J.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/k = 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.371/1.38) * 1e5 ≈0.993 *1e5=99300 K.

Multiply by 1.5151e-5:

99300 * 1.5151e-5 = (99300) * (0.000015151)

Compute 99300 *0.000015151.

Let me compute 99300 * 1.5151e-5.

We can write 99300 =9.93e4.

So 9.93e4 * 1.5151e-5 = 9.93 *1.5151 * (1e4 * 1e-5) )= 9.93 *1.5151 *0.1.

Compute 9.93 *1.5151:

1.5151 *10=15.151, so 1.5151 *9.93 ≈ (15.151 *0.993)

Let me compute 15.151 *0.993:

Approximately, 15.151*(1-0.007)=15.151 - 0.106=15.045.

So 15.045 *0.1 =1.5045.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5045.

Thus, exp(1.5045) ≈4.49.

Which is about 4.5, so option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( T \) is the temperature, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio (assumed constant here). The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Energy difference \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / (kT) \) for \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} \approx 16.55.
\]

For \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} \approx 18.07.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor \( R_0 / R_1 \)
The factor is:

\[
\frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now compute:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.502.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp(1.502) \approx 4.49.
\]

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star that's being studied by astronomers. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. Let's unpack this. So, the key here is understanding how the ratio of populations in two energy levels changes with temperature. Since the photosphere is in LTE, I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, with E2 > E1.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio of n2 to n1 depends on the temperature. Let's denote this ratio as R = n2/n1. Without spots, the effective temperature is higher (6000 K), and when spots are present, it's lower (5500 K). But wait, the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff decreases, so the star is cooler overall. But how does that affect the energy levels of Ti?

Wait, actually, the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff becomes 5500K. So the photosphere as a whole is now at a lower temperature. So the Ti atoms in the photosphere are in a lower temperature environment when spots are present.

So the ratio R (n2/n1) will change based on the temperature. Let's think about how R changes when T changes. The exponential term is the key here. When the temperature increases, the exponential term becomes less negative, which means R increases. So, when the star is hotter (no spots), R should be higher than when it's cooler (spots present). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That makes sense because the temperature is lower, so R would decrease.

So when there are no spots (T=6000 K), R is higher, and when there are spots (T=5500 K), R is lower. The question is asking for the factor by which R changes. That is, factor = R_no_spots / R_spots.

Wait, no. Wait the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R_spots = R(T=5500 K) is lower than R_no_spots = R(T=6000 K). So the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots.

So, I need to compute the ratio of R at 6000K to R at 5500K.

But let's get the exact equation. The ratio R is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether g2 and g1 change. Oh, I think in this case, we can assume that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same regardless of the star's temperature. Because g depends on the quantum states, not the temperature. So, g2/g1 is a constant, let's call it 'Q'. So R = Q * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, the ratio R when there are no spots is R0 = Q * exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )

And when there are spots, it's R1 = Q * exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

So the factor is R0/R1 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Simplify this:

R0/R1 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract exponents.

Wait, because:

[exp(a)] / [exp(b)] = exp(a - b)

So in this case, a = -ΔE/(k*6000), and b = -ΔE/(k*5500)

So:

a - b = [ -ΔE/(6000k) ] - [ -ΔE/(5500k) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So R0/R1 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Wait, but 1/5500 is bigger than 1/6000, so the exponent is positive. So exp of a positive number, which is greater than 1. So R0 is bigger than R1, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

But how do I find ΔE? The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon emitted or absorbed during the transition.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. Since the transition is between two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE is equal to the photon's energy.

So, ΔE = hc / λ

But wait, photons emitted when an electron drops from higher to lower energy have energy E = ΔE. So that's correct.

So, let's compute ΔE.

h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 2.99792458e8 m/s

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, plugging in:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 2.998e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Let me compute that:

First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = approx 1.985e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE = 1.985e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx (1.985 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J

1.985 / 1.448 ≈ 1.371

So ΔE ≈ 1.371e-18 J per photon.

But wait, each photon's energy is ΔE. So the energy per photon is 1.371e-18 J.

But wait, when calculating the exponent in the Boltzmann equation, it's ΔE/(k T), so let's compute that.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K

So ΔE/(k T) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T )

Compute this for each T.

Wait, but since we have two temperatures, 6000 K and 5500 K, we can compute the value for each.

Wait, but in the exponent, we have (ΔE / (k T)).

Wait, but let me compute x = ΔE/(k T) for T=6000 and T=5500.

So:

x6000 = (1.371e-18) / (1.38e-23 * 6000 )

Compute denominator first: 1.38e-23 *6e3 = 8.28e-20

So x6000 = (1.371e-18) / (8.28e-20) = approx (1.371 / 8.28) * 1e2 ≈ (0.1655) * 100 ≈ 16.55

Similarly, x5500:

x5500 = (1.371e-18) / (1.38e-23 *5500 )

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20

x5500 = (1.371e-18)/(7.59e-20) = (1.371 /7.59) * 1e2 ≈ 0.1807 *100 ≈ 18.07

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, 1.371e-18 divided by 7.59e-20 is (1.371 /7.59) * 1e2. Let me compute 1.371 /7.59.

7.59 goes into 1.371 approximately 0.18 times, so 0.18 times 100 is 18. So x5500 is approximately 18.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.371e-18 / 7.59e-20 = (1.371 / 7.59) * 1e2

Calculating 1.371 / 7.59:

7.59 is about 7.59. Let me do 1.371 ÷7.59.

7.59 * 0.18 is about 1.3662, which is close to 1.371. So approximately 0.18, so x5500≈18.

Similarly, x6000 is (1.371e-18)/(8.28e-20) = (1.371/8.28) *1e2.

1.371 /8.28 is approximately 0.1655. So x6000 ≈16.55.

Wait, but wait, actually, the exponent in the ratio R0/R1 is (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this term directly.

So, let me compute the term inside the exponent:

(ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ]

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Compute 1/5500 ≈1.818e-4

1/6000≈1.667e-4

Difference: (1.818e-4 -1.667e-4)= 0.151e-4=1.51e-5.

So,

(ΔE/(k)) * (1.51e-5) 

We have ΔE=1.371e-18 J.

So,

(1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * 1.51e-5 = 

First, compute 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approx 9.935e4 = 9.935e4 K.

Wait, because J/(J/K) = K. So 1.371e-18 /1.38e-23 = (1.371/1.38) * 1e5 = approx 0.993 *1e5 ≈99300 K.

Then multiply by 1.51e-5:

99300 * 1.51e-5 = 99300 * 0.0000151 ≈

Let me compute 99300 *0.0000151.

Multiply 99300 by 1.51e-5.

99300 = 9.93e4.

9.93e4 * 1.51e-5 = 9.93 *1.51 * 1e-1 = (approx 15.00) *0.1 = 1.5.

Wait, 9.93 *1.51: let's compute that.

1.51 *10 is 15.1, but since it's 9.93, maybe 15.1 * (993/1000) ≈15.1 *0.993 ≈15.0.

So 9.93 *1.51 ≈15.02

So 15.02 * 1e-1 = 1.502.

So the exponent is approximately 1.502.

Wait, so the exponent is about 1.5. So the factor R0/R1 is exp(1.5) ≈4.48.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because that's a crucial step.

So:

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Let me calculate more accurately.

1/5500 = (1/5500) = (approx) 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So 1.5151e-5.

Compute (ΔE)/(k) * (1.5151e-5).

ΔE is 1.371e-18 J.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/k = 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.371/1.38) * 1e5 ≈0.993 *1e5=99300 K.

Multiply by 1.5151e-5:

99300 * 1.5151e-5 = (99300) * (0.000015151)

Compute 99300 *0.000015151.

Let me compute 99300 * 1.5151e-5.

We can write 99300 =9.93e4.

So 9.93e4 * 1.5151e-5 = 9.93 *1.5151 * (1e4 * 1e-5) )= 9.93 *1.5151 *0.1.

Compute 9.93 *1.5151:

1.5151 *10=15.151, so 1.5151 *9.93 ≈ (15.151 *0.993)

Let me compute 15.151 *0.993:

Approximately, 15.151*(1-0.007)=15.151 - 0.106=15.045.

So 15.045 *0.1 =1.5045.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5045.

Thus, exp(1.5045) ≈4.49.

Which is about 4.5, so option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( T \) is the temperature, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio (assumed constant here). The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Energy difference \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / (kT) \) for \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} \approx 16.55.
\]

For \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} \approx 18.07.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor \( R_0 / R_1 \)
The factor is:

\[
\frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now compute:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.502.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp(1.502) \approx 4.49.
\]

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
