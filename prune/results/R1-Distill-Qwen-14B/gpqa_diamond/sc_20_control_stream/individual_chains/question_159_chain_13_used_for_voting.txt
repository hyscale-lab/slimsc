Okay, so I've got a question here about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me think. The question is about determining the comoving distance of a quasar based on certain observations. 

Wait, the quasar shows a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. Oh right, that sounds like something related to redshift. Because if the quasar is moving away, its light would be redshifted. So shorter wavelengths (blue) would be shifted to longer (red) wavelengths.

So the peak in the spectrum at 790 nm might be the Lyman-alpha emission line, which normally is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. Because the Lyman-alpha line is a prominent emission line in quasars. If it's observed at 790 nm, that would mean a significant redshift. Let me calculate the redshift factor.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So, 790 / 121 ≈ around 6.528. So z ≈ 5.528? Wait, let me compute that exactly. 790 divided by 121 is... 121 times 6 is 726, 121*6.5 is 786.5. So 790 is 3.5 more than 786.5. So 6.5 + (3.5/121) ≈ 6.5 + 0.029 ≈ 6.529. So z≈6.529.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance is a way to measure cosmic distances taking into account the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters, like the Hubble constant, matter density, dark energy, etc.

The parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0). So the cosmology is Lambda-CDM.

The question is, what's the comoving distance (at a=1, which is today) to the quasar. So I need to calculate the comoving distance for a source at redshift z≈6.529.

Wait, but wait. Comoving distance is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(a H(a)) da, but a is the scale factor. Alternatively, it's expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift. The formula is D_c = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1 / E(z')] dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r(1+z)^4 + Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_k(1+z)^2 + Ω_lambda). Wait, but in our case, dark energy is dominant, so it's E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda).

Wait, but wait, the integral is complicated. Maybe I can find an approximate value for the comoving distance at z≈6.5. Let's think about it.

I remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance increases significantly. For example, at z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 billion light-years or roughly 0.47 Gpc (but not exact, depends on cosmology). But in this case, z is about 6.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can recall that the comoving distance for high redshifts can be approximated using certain formulas or look-up tables based on cosmological parameters.

Wait, another approach: the age of the universe at redshift z is given by the integral from z to infinity of 1/E(z') dz', but wait, no. The age is the integral from 0 to z of 1/(E(z') (1+z')) dz. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate using a calculator or approximate formula. But since I don't have access to a calculator right now, maybe I can think about standard values. 

Wait, I think at z=1, the comoving distance is roughly 2 Gpc for H0=70. But wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the Hubble distance is c/H0, which for H0=70 is about 14 billion light-years, or ~4400 Mpc. So 4.4 Gpc. So comoving distance for z=1 would be about 2 Gpc? Or wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the comoving distance is longer than the Hubble distance for higher z.

Wait, perhaps I should use an online calculator or think of a standard formula. Alternatively, maybe the comoving distance is proportional to the integral of 1/E(z) dz, which for E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7). So for z=6.5, (1+z)=7.5, so (1+z)^3 = 421.875. Multiply by 0.3, gives 126.5625. 0.7 is 0.7, so E(z) = sqrt(126.5625 +0.7) = sqrt(127.2625)≈ 11.28.

Wait no, wait. E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). So at z=6.5, Ω_m*(1+z)^3 = 0.3*(7.5)^3=0.3*421.875=126.5625. Ω_lambda is 0.7. So E(z)=sqrt(126.5625 +0.7)=sqrt(127.2625)=11.28. 

So then, the integrand becomes 1/11.28 ≈ 0.0887. But wait, that's at a particular z. The integral is over dz from 0 to z of 1/E(z) dz.

Wait, but that's only a single point. To get the integral, perhaps I need to use a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate formula or use a table.

I remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance can be approximated. Let's see: at z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 Gpc (approximate, depends on cosmology). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for comoving distance in a flat universe dominated by dark energy (since Ω_lambda=0.7, which is higher than Ω_m=0.3).

The comoving distance is D_c = (c / H0) * f(z), where f(z) is the integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz', and E(z)=sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7).

So for z=6.5, let's approximate f(z). Since E(z) is dominated by the matter term at lower z and dark energy at higher z, but at z=6.5, (1+z)=7.5, so (1+z)^3=421.875. Ω_m*(1+z)^3=0.3*421.875=126.56. So E(z)=sqrt(126.56 +0.7)=sqrt(127.26)=~11.28.

Wait, but E(z) decreases as z increases. So for higher z, the integrand 1/E(z) increases. But since the integral is from 0 to z, and E(z) is high at high z, the integrand is small there. So the integral might be dominated by regions where E(z) is smaller, i.e., lower z.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can use a table or recall some standard values.

Wait, I've heard that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc. But that's when H0 is 70, right? So if I can't remember, perhaps I'll have to think about how the integral behaves.

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance for z=6.5 is around 10 Gpc. Let me check the options: the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So maybe the correct answer is around 8 or 9 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the Hubble distance. H0 is 70, so c/H0 is about 14 billion light-years. But comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * integral [1/E(z') dz']. So if the integral is about, say, 0.5, then D_c would be 7 Gpc (since 14/2 is 7). But for z=6.5, the integral must be larger than that, because at high z, the universe expands more.

Hmm, maybe I can estimate the integral as follows. Let's approximate the integral of 1/E(z) dz from 0 to z=6.5.

But I'm not sure how to proceed without a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for E(z) in a flat universe. Let's think, for a flat universe, E(z)^2 = Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda.

So E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

The integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz' is going to be roughly sqrt(0.7) times some function, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use an online cosmology calculator or recall that at high redshifts, the comoving distance scales approximately with (1 + z) when dark energy dominates. But wait, that's only when the dark energy term is dominant, which occurs when z is large enough that the matter term is small compared to dark energy.

So when (1+z) is large, (1+z)^3 * 0.3 is much smaller than 0.7, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.7) ≈ 0.8366.

Then the integrand 1/E(z) ≈ 1.195. So the integral from some z' to z would be approx 1.195*(z - z'), but that's only if E(z) is roughly constant over that interval.

But for z=6.5, (1+z)=7.5, so (1+z)^3=421.875, 0.3 * 421.875=126.56. So 0.3*(1+z)^3 >> 0.7 at z=6.5? Wait, 0.3*(1+z)^3 =126.56, which is way bigger than 0.7. So E(z)=sqrt(126.56 +0.7)=sqrt(127.26)=≈11.28.

Hmm, so E(z) is dominated by matter at z=6.5. So that approach was wrong. So for z=6.5, E(z) is dominated by matter, so the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7).

Wait, but for z' > around 0.5, the matter term dominates. So the integral from 0 to z=6.5 is going to be dominated by the matter term.

So perhaps I can model E(z) as approximately sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3), which would be sqrt(0.3) * (1+z')^(3/2).

So the integrand becomes 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)).

Then the integral from 0 to z is (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'.

Let me compute that integral:

∫(1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = ∫ u^(-3/2) du, where u = 1+z'.

The integral is (-2) u^(-1/2) + C. So evaluating from 0 to z, it would be [ -2 (1+z)^(-1/2) + 2 (1+0)^(-1/2) ] = 2 [1 - (1+z)^(-1/2)].

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(0.3)) * 2 [1 - (1+z)^(-1/2)].

So for z=6.5, (1+z)=7.5, so (1+z)^(-1/2)=1/sqrt(7.5)≈0.371.

So 1 - 0.371 = 0.629. Multiply by 2: 1.258. Then multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1.826.

So 1.258 * 1.826 ≈ 2.29.

So the integral is approximately 2.29.

Thus, the comoving distance D_c = (c / H0) * integral.

c is 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) )= (3e5 /70) Mpc ≈ 4285.7 Mpc ≈ 4.286 Gpc.

So D_c ≈ 4.286 Gpc * 2.29 ≈ 9.85 Gpc.

Wait, that's about 9.85 Gpc. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 9 Gpc, or option B)8, D)7, etc.

Hmm, but wait, maybe my approximation isn't accurate because I neglected the dark energy contribution. Since at z=6.5, (1+z)^3 is 421.875, and 0.3*421.875=126.56, which is much larger than 0.7, so the dark energy term is negligible in E(z) at that z. So the approximation is perhaps reasonable.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using a better approximation. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the lookback time or age of the universe and relate that to distance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can recall that for high redshifts, the comoving distance for matter-dominated universe (without dark energy) is D_c ≈ (2 c / H0) (1 + 1/(2(1+z)) ). But wait, that's for matter-only universe. But in our case, dark energy is present, so it's different.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with Ω_m and Ω_lambda.

I found a source that says that for a flat universe with Ω_m and Ω_lambda, the comoving distance can be approximated using:

D_c = (c / H0) * [ (2/ (1 + Ω_m)) ) * ( (1 + Ω_m) * (1 + z) + Ω_m )^(1/2) ) / ( (1 + z)^1.5 ) ) ] * some integral. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a table or use a calculator.

Wait, I think in cosmology, the comoving distance for z=6 is around 10 Gpc. So 6.5 would be a bit higher, perhaps 9 or 10 Gpc. So the options give 9 Gpc as option C.

Wait, but wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

Earlier, my approximation gave about 9.85 Gpc, which is close to 10. But the options don't have 10. So perhaps the correct answer is 9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral approximation because I neglected the dark energy contribution. Let me think again.

Wait, let's compute the integral more accurately.

The integral f(z) = ∫ from 0 to z [1 / E(z') ] dz', where E(z') = sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3 + 0.7).

At z'=0, E(0)=sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1. So 1/E(0)=1.

At higher z', E(z') increases, so 1/E decreases.

Hmm, but integrating this accurately would require either numerical methods or a lookup table. Since I can't compute it exactly, perhaps I can estimate it.

Alternatively, I can think about the integral in terms of a function that might be tabulated.

Wait, I remember that for the current cosmology (H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7), the comoving distances at certain redshifts are as follows:

z=0.1: ~0.16 Gpc

z=0.5: ~1.3 Gpc

z=1.0: ~2.1 Gpc

z=2.0: ~4.0 Gpc

z=3.0: ~5.6 Gpc

z=5.0: ~7.6 Gpc

z=6.0: ~8.6 Gpc

z=7.0: ~9.5 Gpc

Wait, if that's the case, then at z=6.5, the distance would be between 8.6 and 9.5 Gpc. So about 9 Gpc.

But looking at the options, option C is 9 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator. But since I can't, I'll proceed with the estimation.

So, the comoving distance for z=6.5 is approximately 9 Gpc. Therefore, the correct answer is C)9 Gpc.

To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth, we analyze the given observations and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, which is redshifted from the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (121 nm). This redshift is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 6.529
\]

The comoving distance \(D_c\) is calculated using the integral:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz',
\]

where \(E(z') = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}\), and the cosmological parameters are \(H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}\), \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7\), and a flat universe (\(\Omega_k = 0\)).

For high redshifts (\(z \gg 1\)), the matter term dominates \(E(z')\) at intermediate redshifts, but dark energy becomes significant at very high redshifts. Approximating the integral numerically or using standard cosmological tables, the comoving distance for \(z \approx 6.5\) is found to be approximately \(9 \, \text{Gpc}\). This aligns with the provided options, where the closest value is \(9 \, \text{Gpc}\).

Thus, the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth is approximately \(9 \, \text{Gpc}\).
