Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. The problem is about the power radiated in the radiation zone as a function of solid angle, and specifically asks for the fraction of the maximum power at a certain angle and the form of the function f.

Wait, right, radiation from oscillating charges. I remember that this is related to the dipole radiation formula. Oh right, the dipole antenna! Because a spheroid with oscillations along the z-axis would act like a dipole.

So dipole radiation has a specific pattern. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta from the dipole's axis. The formula for the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is given by something like (p² omega^4)/(something with c and epsilon_0), multiplied by (1/(4 pi)) and a direction-dependent factor.

Oh wait, the exact formula. The radiated power per unit solid angle for a dipole is ( ( (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/( 12 π c^3 )) ) * ( sin²θ )/(something?), no, wait. Alternatively, I think the intensity is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) times some other terms. Wait, more accurately, the intensity pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin²(theta), because the dipole radiation has a maximum at theta = 90 degrees and zero at theta = 0 and 180 degrees.

But wait, the problem says the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So I need to think about how f depends on lambda.

Wait, lambda is the wavelength, which is related to the frequency. So lambda = c/f, where c is the speed of light and f is the frequency. So as the frequency increases, lambda decreases.

Now, the dipole radiation formula also includes the frequency in the intensity. Let me recall the power formula. The total power radiated by a dipole is ( ( μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/( 12 π c^3 )) * (1/(some factor)).

Wait, no, the total power (P_total) is ( ( μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/( 12 π c^3 )) * (something). But when considering the power per unit solid angle (which is the radiation intensity, I), it's ( ( μ₀ p₀² ω^4 sin^2(theta) )/( 12 π c^3 ) ).

Wait, but I might be mixing some terms. Let me think again. The radiation intensity (I) is given by ( ( (e^2 a^2 ω^4 )/( 6 π ε₀ c^3 )) ) * sin²(theta), where 'a' is the acceleration perhaps. Alternatively, in terms of the dipole moment p, which is p = q a, so maybe p = q a, so a = p/q. So substituting, the intensity I becomes proportional to (p^2 ω^4) sin²(theta) / (something else).

But regardless of the exact constants, the dependence on lambda comes from the frequency. Because the dipole is oscillating, the frequency determines the radiation. Since lambda = c / f, and frequency f is omega/(2 pi), so omega = 2 pi f. So omega is proportional to 1/lambda.

So the intensity I is proportional to (omega^4) * sin²(theta). Since omega is proportional to 1/lambda, omega^4 would be proportional to 1/lambda^4. Therefore, the function f(theta, lambda) would be proportional to (1/lambda^4) * sin²(theta).

Wait, but the function f in the question is the radiated power per unit solid angle. So f would be proportional to 1/lambda^4 multiplied by sin^2(theta). So when the problem asks for the possible form of f, looking at the options, the options list forms like lambda^(-3), lambda^(-4), etc.

So the function f(theta, lambda) is proportional to lambda^(-4) and sin^2(theta). So the f function includes a lambda^-4 term.

Now, the second part is about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at theta=30 degrees. The maximum power would be when sin^2(theta) is maximum. Since sin(theta) is maximum at theta=90 degrees, where sin(theta)=1. So the maximum intensity is when theta=90 degrees, giving sin^2(theta)=1.

At theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2(theta)=0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25 times the maximum. So if the maximum is A, the fraction at theta=30 degrees is A * 0.25, which is (1/4)*A. So the fraction is 1/4.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says 1/4 and lambda^(-4), which matches both the fraction and the dependence on lambda.

Wait, let me check again. The function f is the intensity, which is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum power is A, so the fraction at theta=30 would be (f(theta=30)/f_max) = (sin^2(30)/sin^2(90)) ) * (lambda^something terms).

Wait, no, because the function f already includes the lambda dependence. The maximum f would be when theta=90, so f_max = f(theta=90, lambda) = K * (1/lambda^4) * 1. The f at theta=30 would be K * (1/lambda^4) * (1/4). So the fraction is [ (1/4) K (1/lambda^4) ] / [ K (1/lambda^4) ] ) = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, regardless of lambda. So indeed, the fraction is 1/4.

Looking at the options, option C is fraction 1/4, function f proportional to lambda^-4. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, what about the options? Let me look again.

Option C: 1/4, lambda^(-4). That fits. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates power at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), and the task is to determine the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

For a dipole radiator, the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\) and depends on the frequency (or equivalently, \(\lambda\)). The intensity is proportional to \(\omega^4 \sin^2(\theta)\), where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency. Since \(\omega \propto 1/\lambda\), the intensity is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4} \sin^2(\theta)\). Thus, the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\).

The maximum power radiated occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25\). Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(0.25\), or \(1/4\).

From the options provided:
- Option A: \(1/2, \lambda^{-4}\) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \(1/4\), not \(1/2\).
- Option B: \(1/4, \lambda^{-3}\) — Incorrect, as the function \(f\) depends on \(\lambda^{-4}\), not \(\lambda^{-3}\).
- Option C: \(1/4, \lambda^{-4}\) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the dependence on \(\lambda\).
- Option D: \(3/4, \lambda^{-6}\) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \(1/4\), and the function \(f\) depends on \(\lambda^{-4}\), not \(\lambda^{-6}\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
