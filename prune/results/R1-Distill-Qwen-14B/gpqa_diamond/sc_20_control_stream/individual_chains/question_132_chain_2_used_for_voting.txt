Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what's given.

The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2= 8/2=4. So four degrees, which could be one benzene ring (3 double bonds plus a ring) and one double bond, but more likely, just one benzene ring and maybe some substituents. Wait, benzene is three degrees, so one more, so maybe a double bond elsewhere. Or maybe it's just a mono-substituted benzene with some substituents.

Wait, looking at the options, all the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl. Let's check their molecular formulas.

Tetramethylbenzenes: benzene has 6 C, each methyl is CH3. So 6 +4=10 C. So the formula would be C10H14. Similarly, diethyl would be two ethyl groups on benzene: each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls are 4 C and 10 H. Benzene is 6 C. So total 6+4=10 C, and H: 6*1 (benzene) + 10 (ethyls) = 16 H? Wait, no. Wait, benzene has 6 C and 6 H. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3, so each has 2 C and 7 H (since attached as a substituent, so minus a H each). So two ethyl groups would be 4 C and 12 H. Benzene (6 C, 6 H) plus two ethyl groups: 10 C, 6 +12=18 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14. So 18 H isn't matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. So each ethyl is -CH2CH3. Each ethyl adds 5 H (since the substituent is one point of attachment). So two ethyls give 10 H. Benzene has 6 H. So total H is 6 + (2*5) = 16. But the formula is C10H14, so that's 14 H. So this doesn't match. Hmm, unless I've made a mistake. Wait, wait: the molecular formula given is C10H14.

Looking at diethylbenzene: benzene (C6H5) + two ethyl groups (each C2H5). So total is C8H10. Oh wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Two ethyl groups (each C2H5) would add 4 C and 10 H. So C6+4=10 C, and H:6 +10=16. But the formula is C10H14. So 16 H isn't matching. So diethylbenzene would have C8H10? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So when attached to benzene, each is a substituent. Benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl: the first CH2 is attached to benzene. So each ethyl contributes (3 H from CH3 and 2 H from CH2?), wait no. Let me calculate properly.

Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each has 5 H. Two ethyl groups contribute 10 H. Benzene has 6 H. So total H = 6 + 10 =16. But the molecular formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. So that's a problem. So 1,4-diethylbenzene's formula would be C8H10? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Two ethyl groups (each C2H5) add 4 C and 10 H. So total C is 6+4=10, H is 6+10=16. So the formula would be C10H16, which doesn't match the given C10H14.

So wait, the given compounds have C10H14. So diethyl would require 16 H, which is more. So the diethyl compound isn't in the options? Or perhaps the diethyl is monoethyl? No, the question says 1,4-diethylbenzene.

So that suggests that perhaps the diethylbenzene isn't a candidate, because it would have a higher H count. Wait, but the question includes 1,4-diethylbenzene as an option. So maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait another approach. Let's take 1,4-diethylbenzene: Structure is benzene ring with two ethyl groups in the 1 and 4 positions.

Each ethyl group is CH2CH3. So the molecule is C6H5 (CH2CH3)2. So the molecular formula is C6 + 2*(C2) = C10. H: 6 (benzene) + 2*(5) [each ethyl has 5 H, because the point of attachment is one H, the ethyl group has 2 CH2 and one CH3. Wait, no, each ethyl has 2 CH2 groups? No, ethyl is CH2CH3. So when attached, the benzene has a substituent -CH2CH3. So each substituent contributes 5 H (since CH2CH3 has 5 H). So two substituents contribute 10 H. Benzene has 6 H. Total H is 6+10=16. So formula is C10H16. But the given molecular formula is C10H14. So that can't be. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H16, which doesn't match. So the options with diethylbenzene (option C) would have the wrong formula. So perhaps option C is not the answer.

Wait, but in the question, both compounds have C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene can't be part of the mixture, because it's C10H16. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl is not ethyl but something else. Wait, maybe it's a substituent with fewer H. Or maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed under the assumption that the given options are correct.

So, maybe the diethylbenzene is a typo, but assuming it's correct, perhaps the H count is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl with a double bond elsewhere, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl groups are attached in such a way that they have fewer H. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not ethyl. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl is not in the para position but another arrangement, but that probably doesn't affect H count.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl is part of a ring, but that's unlikely.

Well, perhaps the diethylbenzene isn't the correct option. So looking at the other options.

The options are:

A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.

C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and diethyl.

D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

So, diethyl is only in option C.

But since diethyl would require more H, perhaps option C is incorrect. So the two compounds are both tetramethylbenzenes.

So the two compounds are tetramethyl derivatives of benzene.

Now, looking at the NMR spectrum. The aromatic region shows two singlets, each in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet, and in the mixture, they are present 1:1, so the peaks are 1:1.

Wait, but wait, the NMR has two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. The integration is 1:1 for the two signals.

So each compound has a singlet in the aromatic region, and when mixed in 1:1, each contributes equally. So each aromatic region is a singlet, meaning that the substituents are in such a way that all the aromatic protons are equivalent.

Wait, which tetramethylbenzenes have all equivalent aromatic protons?

Let me think about each option.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. So that's a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. Let me imagine the structure. So positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. Then the remaining positions are 5 and 6, which are H. Wait, but wait, tetra substitution would mean four substituents, so positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl, and the ring is symmetric in some way.

Wait, but for a tetramethyl benzene, the positions can vary. Let's think about 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's a 1,2,3,4 arrangement. So it's a contiguous four substituents. Wait, but that's a possibility. But in such a structure, are the aromatic Hs equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps it's 1,2,3,4 in a square-like arrangement. Let me think about the symmetry. The molecule with four substituents in positions 1,2,3,4 would have a plane of symmetry between positions 5 and 6. So the two remaining Hs (positions 5 and 6) would each be equivalent in their own positions, but are they equivalent to each other? No, because substituents are in 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents on 4 and 1, respectively. Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Alternatively, another approach. Let's consider each tetramethylbenzene structure and their symmetry.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:

Positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups.

So, the ring has substituents in four consecutive positions.

The molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, but the two Hs are in positions 5 and 6, which are adjacent to substituents. So positions 5 and 6 would have different environments. So their Hs would not be equivalent. So their chemical shifts would be different. So the NMR would show two sets of Hs. But in the given NMR, it's two singlets. So each compound's aromatic region is a singlet. So each compound must have all equivalent Hs in the aromatic region.

Wait, so each compound must have all aromatic protons equivalent. So in each case, the substituents arrange in such a way that all H environments are the same.

How can that happen?

If the substituents are in a way that all the aromatic Hs are equivalent. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, such that all remaining Hs are equivalent.

Let me think about each option's substituents.

Looking at 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents are in 1,2,3,5. Let me think about the symmetry. That's positions 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 are H. Are those Hs equivalent? Let me think.

If the substituents are in 1,2,3,5, then the molecule is symmetric along the axis perpendicular to the 1-4 line. So the H at 4 and 6 would be equivalent. So, each would have the same chemical shift, so the NMR would show a singlet.

Wait, no. Because substituents are in 1,2,3,5. The Hs at positions 4 and 6: their environments might be different. Let me think about the substituents around them.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl:

Position 4 is adjacent to substituents at 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps in this arrangement, Hs at 4 and 6 are equivalent. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine rotating the ring so that positions 4 and 6 swap. The substituents would still be in the same positions. So yes, they are equivalent. So their Hs would have the same shift.

So 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl would have two equivalent Hs (4 and 6), giving a singlet.

Wait, but how many Hs are present? Since it's a benzene ring, each substituent is a methyl group. So in 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl, substituents are on four positions, leaving two positions (4 and 6) with H. Each position has one H. So total two Hs. So integrating as a singlet with 2 H. But the NMR shows two singlets, each with 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes a singlet. So each compound has one H environment.

Wait, but in 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl, there are two Hs, which would be as a singlet (same shift). So in the NMR, each compound would contribute a singlet for their aromatic Hs. So when mixed, the two compounds would each contribute their own singlet, but in a 1:1 ratio. So the NMR would show two singlets, each 1:1 (if the two compounds have different shifts). Because the mixture is 1:1, each contributes equally.

Wait, but the problem says that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So each signal has the same integration, so same number of Hs. So for each compound, the aromatic region has the same number of Hs, and each peak is a singlet.

Looking at the options, each of the tetramethylbenzenes would have either one H or two Hs in the aromatic ring.

Wait, for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,3,4.

In this case, the remaining Hs are on positions 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let's think about symmetry. So in 1,2,3,4 substitution, if the molecule is symmetric, perhaps positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. So their Hs would be a singlet.

Another way: considering the molecule's symmetry. If there's a 4-fold symmetry, then all Hs would be equivalent. Or perhaps not.

Wait, wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is sometimes called p-xylene when substituents are 1,2,3,4? No, wait, p-xylene is 1,4-dimethyl, but that's only two substituents.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would have four substituents in a row, making a sort of "square" around the ring. How would the Hs be arranged?

In such a substitution, the two remaining Hs (positions 5 and 6) would each have the same environment. Because the molecule is symmetric through the plane that runs through the center between positions 1 and 4. So, position 5 and 6 are mirror images. So their Hs are equivalent, resulting in a singlet of 2 H.

So in this case, each of the two aromatic compounds would have a singlet in the aromatic region. So when mixed, we'd see two singlets, each corresponding to each compound's Hs.

Similarly, let's think about 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are Hs.

Is there symmetry such that the Hs at 3 and 6 are equivalent? Let me see. The molecule has a center of symmetry. So position 3 and 6 would be mirror images. So their Hs would be equivalent, leading to a singlet of 2 H.

So, in this case, the aromatic region would be a singlet of 2 H.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl has substituents at 1,2,3,5, leaving positions 4 and 6 as Hs, which are equivalent, leading to a singlet of 2 H.

Wait, but in the NMR, each compound would contribute a singlet, and the mixture would have two singlets. So, each compound must have a singlet, but their shifts are different, leading to two singlets.

So, in the NMR, two singlets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 H. Because each compound has 2 H in the aromatic region?

Wait, no, no. Each compound's aromatic Hs are 2 H. So in a 1:1 mixture, each would contribute 2 H, but the total would be 4 H in the aromatic region. But the NMR shows two signals (each a singlet) in a 1:1 ratio. So each peak integrates to 2 H? Or 1 H each?

Wait, the question states that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So the area under each peak is the same. So if each compound contributes 2 H, then each peak would be 2 H, but that would make a 1:1 ratio in the areas (since 2:2 is 1:1). Alternatively, each compound contributes 1 H, making 1:1. Hmm, but that's not possible, because substituents in tetramethyl would only leave two Hs, which would be equivalent, leading to a 2 H singlet. So perhaps each compound's aromatic region has 2 H, and each contributes 2 H, so the NMR shows two 2H singlets, in a 1:1 ratio (so 2:2). But the question says "two signals ... in a 1:1 ratio." So the integration is 1:1. That suggests each compound contributes 1 H, but that's impossible with the structures. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let's think about each structure:

1. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,3,4. The remaining Hs are in positions 5 and 6. These two are equivalent, so the NMR would show a singlet integrating to 2 H.

2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,3,5. Remaining Hs in 4 and 6. They are equivalent, so a singlet of 2 H.

3. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,4,5. Remaining Hs in 3 and 6. Equiv., singlet of 2 H.

4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: substituents on 1 and 4. Remaining Hs in 2,3,5,6. Are these equivalent? Let's see. Structure is para-diethyl. The ring would have Hs in positions 2,3,5,6. Are they all equivalent? No. Because positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituents on 1 and 3. Wait, the substituents are at 1 and 4, so positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituent at 1 and 5? Or wait, substituents are in 1 and 4. So positions 2 is next to 1 and 3; position 3 is next to 2 and 4; position 5 is next to 4 and 6; position 6 is next to 5 and 1.

In such a case, the Hs in positions 2,3,5,6 would not all be equivalent. They would be in different environments, leading to multiple signals. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have more than one peak in the NMR aromatic region, which doesn't match the given data (only two singlets). So 1,4-diethylbenzene is unlikely to be one of the compounds, as its aromatic Hs would split into multiple peaks, not a singlet.

So, given that, the two compounds must be tetramethylbenzenes whose aromatic regions give a singlet. So the options are structures where the remaining Hs are equivalent.

Now, the NMR also shows three singlets at 2.2 ppm, 2:1:1 ratio.

So, these are likely the methyl groups attached to the benzene. Because in tetramethylbenzenes, the substituents are methyl groups, which typically appear around 2.3 ppm as singlets if they are equivalent.

So, the three signals at 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 ratio. The ratio suggests that the three signals come from different types of methyl groups.

Wait, each compound has four methyl groups. So each would have four CH3 groups. But perhaps in some of the structures, some of the methyl groups are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

For example, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, all the methyl groups are in a symmetric position, so perhaps they are all equivalent, giving a single singlet. But that's not possible, because in 1,2,3,4 substitution, the methyl groups are in adjacent positions. Wait, no. 1,2,3,4 substitution would have four methyl groups in a row, so their environments are not all identical.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,2,3,4 substitution would have all four methyl groups adjacent, but in a square-like arrangement. So perhaps each methyl group is in a unique environment, leading to multiple signals.

Alternatively, perhaps in some structures, some methyl groups are equivalent.

Let me think about each option's methyl group environment.

Let's think about each structure:

1. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4.

Each methyl is adjacent to the next. The structure would be symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So in this case, methyl groups at 1 and 4 might be equivalent, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 might be equivalent. So we would have two types of methyl groups: the ones at positions 1 and 4, and the ones at 2 and 3.

Wait, so 1 and 4 are across from each other, so their environment would be the same. Similarly, 2 and 3 are adjacent to 1 and 4, respectively, so their environment would be same. So in this case, the methyl groups would split into two sets: two equivalent methyl groups (positions 1 and 4) giving a singlet, and two equivalent methyl groups (positions 2 and 3) giving another singlet.

So, each 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have two methyl signals: one for positions 1 and 4 (integrate to 2 H?), and another for positions 2 and 3 (2 H). Wait, no, each methyl is a CH3, so each has 3 H. So positions 1 and 4 each have a CH3, so together 6 H, appearing as a singlet. Positions 2 and 3 each have CH3, together 6 H, another singlet.

But wait, the NMR shows three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps in each structure, the methyl groups are in different environments, leading to multiple signals.

Wait, let's think about each option's substituents:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Let's consider 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene first.

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,4,5.

The molecule's symmetry would be such that:

- Positions 1 and 5 are substituents.

- Positions 2 and 4 are substituents.

So, for the methyl groups, the ones at positions 1 and 5 may be in equivalent environments, as may the ones at 2 and 4.

So in this case, the methyl groups would split into two signals: one from 1 and 5 (each CH3, 6 H total), and another from 2 and 4 (each CH3, 6 H total). So two signals.

Similarly, for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:

Substituents at 1,2,3,5.

In this structure, positions 1,2,3,5 are substituted. The remaining Hs are at 4 and 6, which are equivalent.

For methyl groups:

- Methyl at 1: adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (but 6 is H).

Wait, perhaps I should think about symmetry.

In 1,2,3,5 substitution, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent due to symmetry. Similarly, position 2's methyl and position 5's methyl may be equivalent.

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure. If you have substituents at 1,2,3,5, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the plane passing through position 4 and 6. Then, substituents at 1 and 3 would be mirror images, as would substituents at 2 and 5. So, methyl groups at 1 and 3 would be equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 would be equivalent.

So, in this structure, there would be two types of methyl groups: two at 1 and 3 (each CH3, total 6 H), and two at 2 and 5 (each CH3, total 6 H). So two signals.

Wait, but the NMR shows three signals. So perhaps each structure in the mixture contributes two methyl signals, but together they make three.

Wait, the given NMR has three singlets: 2:1:1 ratio.

So, the three signals at 2.2 ppm are probably from three different types of methyl groups.

So, each compound contributes some methyl groups, and when mixed, the total signals sum up to three.

Hmm, perhaps one of the compounds has two types of methyl signals, and the other has one, but that's unlikely because each would have four methyl groups.

Wait, but in the mixture, perhaps each compound has a unique methyl environment. Let's think:

Suppose compound A has two types of methyl groups (say, a and b), each contributing two singlets.

Compound B has three types of methyl groups (a, b, c), but that's not possible as each has four methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't the right way. Let me think about each structure and how many methyl signals they produce.

1. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents in a square. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two signals.

2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents in a way that methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So two signals.

3. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. The methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So two signals.

4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: substituents at 1 and 4. The ethyl groups are in para positions, so their CH3 groups are equivalent. So each ethyl group has a CH3. But since the two ethyls are equivalent, their CH3s would give a single singlet.

Wait, but diethyl has two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is CH2CH3. The CH3 groups in each ethyl are equivalent because of the molecule's symmetry. So the CH3s would appear as a single singlet, integrating to 6 H (2 ethyls * 3 H each).

So, for diethylbenzene, the methyl groups would be a single singlet of 6 H.

Wait, but earlier I thought diethyl would have a different formula, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Diethylbenzene: C6H5(CH2CH3)2. So, each ethyl contributes 2 C and 5 H.

So, C: 6 + 2*2=10. H:5*2=10, plus benzene's 6 H (but benzene is C6H6, so if two ethyl groups are attached, each as -CH2CH3, the H would be 6 (benzene) + 2*(2 (CH2) +3 (CH3)) )= 6 + (2*5)= 16 H.

But the formula is C10H14. So 16 H is more, which doesn't fit. So diethyl is C10H16, which doesn't match. So the diethyl compound isn't part of the mixture. So options that include diethyl (option C) can be eliminated.

So, the remaining options are A, B, D, which are pairs of tetramethylbenzenes.

Now, considering the NMR's methyl signals: three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So, each compound contributes some number of methyl signals, and when they are mixed, the signals combine.

Let me think about each possible pair and how their methyl signals would combine.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Let's analyze each:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Substituents at 1,2,4,5.

As discussed earlier, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent (each CH3), and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So this structure would produce two methyl signals: one for 1 and 5 (6 H), another for 2 and 4 (6 H). So in the NMR, each would contribute two singlets.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5.

Methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So two methyl signals: 6 H and 6 H.

So, when these two compounds are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the NMR would show:

For each compound, two methyl signals. So in total, how do they combine?

For the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl): two signals, say a and b.

For the second compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): two signals, say c and d.

But the NMR shows three signals. So perhaps some of the signals overlap.

Wait, but if the two compounds have one methyl signal in common, then the total would be three.

So, when we mix the two, which signals would be the same?

Let's think about the shifts.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. So the methyl at 1 and 5 have a certain shift, and those at 2 and 4 another.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl, the methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. So their methyl at 1 and 3 would have a certain shift, and methyl at 2 and 5 another.

So perhaps the methyl groups at 2 in both compounds are in similar environments, leading to the same shift. Similarly, perhaps the methyl at 5 in both compounds are in similar environments. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in each structure, the methyl groups have different shifts.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl's methyl at 2 and 4 would be in a different environment than 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl's methyl at 2 and 5.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.

The NMR shows three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. So, assuming each is a singlet of a certain number of H:

The peaks are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So possible:

Singlet A: 6 H (2 parts: but in a 2:1:1, 2 parts would be 8 H? No, wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, which adds up to 4 parts. If each part is 1 H, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the integrations are 4, 2, 2. But the question doesn't specify the actual integration numbers, just the ratio.

Wait, the question says "three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio." So the three signals integrate to 2,1,1 parts.

So, if total is 4 parts, each part is 3 H (since 4 parts = 12 H), but the molecular formula is C10H14. Wait, 10 carbons, 14 H.

Wait, but each compound has four methyl groups, each contributing 3 H, so 4 *3=12 H. Two compounds would contribute 24 H, but the entire molecule is C10H14, which is impossible. Wait, no, the mixture is 1:1 of two aromatic compounds each with C10H14. So each compound has 14 H.

Wait, but each compound is C10H14. So each has 14 H. So in the mixture, each contributes 14 H. But the NMR shows three singlets in the aliphatic region, which are the methyl groups.

Wait, each aromatic compound has four methyl groups (each CH3), so 4 *3=12 H in methyl groups. The remaining 2 H are in the aromatic ring. So each compound has 12 H in methyl and 2 H in aromatic.

So in the mixture, each contributes 12 H in methyl and 2 H in aromatic. The NMR shows the methyl signals, which are 12 H from each compound, but when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the total is 24 H.

But the NMR shows three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the three signals have a total of 24 H, and the ratio is 2:1:1. So 2+1+1=4 parts. So each part is 6 H. So the three signals would be 12 H, 6 H, 6 H.

So, for the three signals, each corresponds to 12, 6, 6 H.

How can this happen?

If one type of methyl group in both compounds is identical, then their signals would combine. So, for example, if one of the methyl groups in both compounds is the same, the integration would be the sum of both.

But each compound has four methyl groups, each possibly in different environments.

So, let's imagine that in one of the compounds, two methyl groups are equivalent, and in the other, one methyl group is equivalent, but perhaps some methyl groups overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound contributes two methyl signals, and when mixed, they produce three distinct signals.

Wait, for example:

If compound X has two methyl signals: 6 H and 6 H.

Compound Y has two methyl signals: 6 H and 6 H.

But, one methyl signal from X and one from Y are the same, leading to a combined 12 H, and the others are separate.

But in that case, the NMR would have two signals: 12 H and 6+6=12 H? No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound contributes two methyl signals, but one signal is present in both, leading to three signals in total.

For example, if both compounds have a methyl group in a certain environment, their signals would combine.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Perhaps I should think of each option and see which combination leads to three methyl signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Option D: compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl (let's call it D1) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl (D2).

D1: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

Methyl groups: 1, 2,4,5.

The methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent (so 6 H, singlet).

Methyl groups at 2 and 4 are equivalent (6 H, singlet).

So D1 contributes two signals: 6 H and 6 H.

D2: substituents at 1,2,3,5.

Methyl groups: 1,2,3,5.

Methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent (6 H, singlet).

Methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent (6 H, singlet).

So D2 contributes two signals: 6 H and 6 H.

When mixed in a 1:1 ratio, each contributes 6 H to each signal.

So, D1 has signals A (6 H) and B (6 H).

D2 has signals C (6 H) and D (6 H).

If any of these signals are the same, their integrations add.

But in reality, the structures are different, so the shifts may be different.

So, the NMR would show four signals. But the given data has three signals, so option D can't be the answer.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider option B.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl (B1) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl (B2).

B1: substituents 1,2,4,5.

Methyl groups at 1 and 5 (equivalent), 2 and 4 (equivalent). So two signals: 6 H and 6 H.

B2: substituents 1,2,3,4.

Methyl groups at 1 and 4 (equivalent), 2 and 3 (equivalent). So two signals: 6 H and 6 H.

So when mixed, each contributes two signals. If any of the signals are the same, then the total would be three.

For example, if B1's 1,5-methyl and B2's 1,4-methyl are in the same environment, their signals would combine. Similarly, if B1's 2,4 and B2's 2,3 are in the same environment, their signals would combine.

But this would depend on the structures' symmetry and substituent positions.

Alternatively, perhaps in B1, the methyl groups at 2 and 4 are in a different environment than those in B2's 2 and 3.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps one of the structures leads to a single methyl signal, and the other leads to two, but that's not likely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in one structure, some methyl groups are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the structures has all four methyl groups in the same environment, leading to a single methyl signal. But I don't think any tetramethylbenzene structure would have all four methyl groups equivalent.

Wait, unless it's 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, but that's only three substituents. But in our case, all structures have four substituents.

Wait, perhaps 1,3,5,7-tetramethylbenzene would have all methyl groups equivalent, but that's not one of the options.

So, perhaps the correct pair of compounds leads to three methyl signals when mixed.

Let me think again.

The NMR shows three signals at 2.2 ppm: 2:1:1 ratio.

So, the total for the aliphatic region is 2:1:1, which could be 6 H, 3 H, 3 H.

Wait, 2 parts +1 part +1 part =4 parts. So 6 H is 1.5 parts, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the integrations are 6, 3, 3.

Wait, but 6 +3 +3 =12 H, which matches the aliphatic H from one compound (since each has 12 H in methyl groups). But wait, the mixture is 1:1, so each contributes 12 H, for a total of 24 H. So the three signals should add up to 24 H.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think about each option:

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl (B1) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl (B2).

B1's methyl signals: two, each 6 H.

B2's methyl signals: two, each 6 H.

If any of B1's signals overlap with B2's, then the total signals would be fewer.

For example, if B1's 1,5-methyl and B2's 1,4-methyl are in the same environment, their signals would combine into one (12 H). Then, B1's 2,4-methyl and B2's 2,3-methyl would each be separate, but if they have the same shift, they'd combine into another 12 H. But that would make two signals, not three.

Alternatively, perhaps each structure contributes two signals, but one of the signals is the same in both, leading to three signals. For example:

B1: signal A (1,5; 6 H) and signal B (2,4; 6 H).

B2: signal A (1,4; 6 H) and signal C (2,3; 6 H).

If signals A and A' are the same, then the combined A would be 12 H. Then, signals B and C would be separate, each 6 H. So total signals: A (12 H), B (6 H), C (6 H). Ratio would be 2:1:1 (12:6:6 → 2:1:1 when divided by 6). That fits the NMR data.

So, in this case, the two compounds' methyl signals would be:

- 1,5-methyl in B1 and 1,4-methyl in B2 have the same shift (unlikely?), leading to a combined 12 H.

- 2,4-methyl in B1 and 2,3-methyl in B2 have different shifts, leading to two separate signals, each 6 H.

So the NMR would show three signals: 12 H, 6 H, 6 H. Ratio is 2:1:1.

That seems to fit.

So, the two compounds would be B1 and B2, which are 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which is option B.

Wait, but the aromatic region: each compound has two Hs in the aromatic ring, which would produce their own singlets.

So, each compound contributes a singlet for their aromatic Hs. The NMR shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each would have a different shift.

So that fits with the given data.

So, putting it together, the correct option is B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture, both with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₄**, based on their **¹H NMR spectrum**. The spectrum shows:

1. **Two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm)** in a 1:1 ratio, indicating that each compound contributes one singlet, and the aromatic protons in each compound are equivalent.
2. **Three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm)** in a 2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to methyl groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**:
   - The molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₄** corresponds to **4 degrees of unsaturation**, consistent with a benzene ring (3 degrees) and one additional double bond or ring. All options are tetramethylbenzenes or a diethylbenzene derivative.

2. **Aromatic Region**:
   - The two singlets in the aromatic region suggest that each compound has **equivalent aromatic protons**. This occurs when the substituents on the benzene ring are arranged symmetrically, leaving equivalent protons in the remaining positions.

3. **Aliphatic Region**:
   - The three singlets in the aliphatic region (2:1:1 ratio) correspond to methyl groups. Each compound has four methyl groups, but their environments differ, leading to distinct signals. The 2:1:1 ratio indicates that one type of methyl group is shared between the two compounds, while the others are unique to each compound.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
     - Both compounds have two sets of equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals each in the aliphatic region. This would result in four signals in total, inconsistent with the observed three signals.
   - **Option B**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.
     - 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5, leading to two signals in the aliphatic region.
     - 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, also leading to two signals in the aliphatic region.
     - When mixed, one methyl signal overlaps (from positions 1 and 2), resulting in three distinct signals in the aliphatic region (2:1:1 ratio). This matches the NMR data.
   - **Option C**: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.
     - 1,4-diethylbenzene has four aromatic protons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6), which are not equivalent, leading to multiple signals in the aromatic region. This contradicts the observed single singlet in the aromatic region.
   - **Option D**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
     - Both compounds have two sets of equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals each in the aliphatic region. This would result in four signals in total, inconsistent with the observed three signals.

### Conclusion:
The correct pair of compounds is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, as this combination explains both the aromatic and aliphatic NMR data.
