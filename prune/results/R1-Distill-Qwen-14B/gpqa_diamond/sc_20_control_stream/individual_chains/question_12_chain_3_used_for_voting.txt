Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, actually, the notation here is a bit confusing. Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino? Or maybe it's a different particle. Hmm, but I think it's a muon plus a neutrino. 

So, the problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary, which probably means it's at rest when it decays. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm not sure what the rest mass of the neutrino is, but since it's a neutrino, maybe it's considered to be negligible? Or perhaps it's treated as having zero rest mass. Because neutrinos are super light, right? Or maybe in some cases, they approximate it as zero for these kinds of calculations. That would make sense because otherwise, we’d need its mass, which isn't given here. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

Wait, but the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. So, the products are a muon and a neutrino. Since the Pi is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So their momenta vectors add up to zero.

Now, the question is to find the kinetic energy of each product. So kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. Since the Pi is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

But wait, when a particle at rest decays, the sum of the rest masses of the products must be less than or equal to the rest mass of the parent. Let me check: the muon is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino has negligible mass. So 105.7 is less than 139.6, which makes sense. So the decay is possible, and the remaining energy will be the kinetic energy of the products.

So the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is a relativistic particle (massless), its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c, but since I'm working in units where c=1, it's just |p| for the neutrino. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4), but again, with c=1, it's sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

But since the Pi is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the magnitude as p. So, p_mu = p, and p_nu = p in opposite direction.

So the total energy of the system is E_mu + E_nu = (sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)) + p.

This total energy must equal the rest energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. So:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, solving for p here. Let me write that equation again.

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me denote m_mu = 105.7, so:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi

Where M_pi is 139.6 MeV.

So I need to solve for p here. Let's let x = p.

So sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) + x = 139.6

Let me call sqrt(x^2 + a^2) = y, where a=105.7. So y = sqrt(x^2 + a^2).

Then y + x = M.

We can rearrange this as y = M - x.

Square both sides:

y^2 = (M - x)^2

Which is x^2 + a^2 = M^2 - 2 M x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

a^2 = M^2 - 2 M x.

So rearranging terms:

2 M x = M^2 - a^2

x = (M^2 - a^2) / (2 M)

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 139.6, a = 105.7.

M^2 = (139.6)^2 = let me compute that.

139.6 * 139.6: 

Well, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, a^2 = (105.7)^2.

105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7 = 147. So (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So M^2 = 19488.16, a^2 = 11172.49.

M^2 - a^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) 

Calculating denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2:

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. Let's see:

279.2 * 29.75 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate 8315.67 / 279.2.

Approximating:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8

279.2 * 0.75 = 209.4

So 29.75 * 279.2 = 8096.8 + 209.4 = 8306.2.

Hmm, 8306.2 is a bit less than 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 - 8306.2 = 9.47.

So 9.47 / 279.2 ≈ 0.034.

So x ≈ 29.75 + 0.034 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV. That is, p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So the momentum of the muon is about 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.784 squared: approximately (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ around 887.086656.

Wait, but 29.784 is actually, let me compute with more precision.

29.784^2 = (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.216^2.

30^2 = 900.

2*30*0.216 = 12.96.

0.216^2 = 0.046656.

So 900 - 12.96 = 887.04; plus 0.046656 = 887.086656.

So 29.784^2 ≈ 887.0867.

And 105.7^2 is 11172.49 as computed earlier.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.0867 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.5767).

What's the square root of 12059.5767?

Well, sqrt(12100)=110, because 110^2=12100. So 12059.5767 is a bit less than that.

110^2 = 12100 → 12100 - 40.4233 = 12059.5767.

So sqrt(12059.5767) ≈ 109.799 MeV.

Wait, approximately, because 109.8^2 is (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

Wait, but our value is 12059.5767, which is a bit higher than 12056.04.

So (109.8)^2=12056.04.

109.8 + x squared would be closer. Let me compute 109.8^2=12056.04.

We need to find x such that (109.8 + x)^2 = 12059.5767.

Expanding: (109.8)^2 + 2*109.8 x + x^2 = 12059.5767.

We have 12056.04 + 219.6 x + x^2 = 12059.5767.

Assuming x is small, x^2 is negligible.

So 219.6 x ≈ 12059.5767 - 12056.04 = 3.5367.

x ≈ 3.5367 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So the sqrt is approximately 109.8 + 0.0161 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu.

m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Hmm, but wait, what about the neutrino's kinetic energy?

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, since its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

But wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Which matches the numbers I just calculated (4.12 MeV and about 29.8 MeV). But wait, the question says "Find KE of product particles", but it's giving two options, which I think are the KEs of the two products. So the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's is about 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option is D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistake.

Hmm, another approach: Let's compute E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

Wait, no, earlier I set up the equation as sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

Wait, but E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu = p.

So total energy is E_mu + E_nu = M_pi.

So that equation was correct.

Let me check the calculation for x again.

x = (M^2 - a^2)/(2M) = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/(2*139.6).

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784.

Yes, that's correct.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(887 + 11172) ≈ sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's the one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The rest mass of the \(\mu^+\) is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's rest mass is assumed to be negligible.

### Key Observations:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy of the system after the decay equals the rest energy of the \(\pi^+\), which is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\).  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, the momenta of the \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let the magnitude of the momentum be \(p\).

3. **Energy of the \(\mu^+\):**  
   The total energy of the \(\mu^+\) is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]  
   where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

4. **Energy of the \(\nu\):**  
   Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its total energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p
   \]

5. **Equation for Total Energy:**  
   Substituting \(E_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = 139.6
   \]

6. **Solving for \(p\):**  
   Rearrange the equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = 139.6 - p
   \]  
   Square both sides:  
   \[
   p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
   \]  
   Expand and simplify:  
   \[
   p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2
   \]  
   Cancel \(p^2\):  
   \[
   m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
   \]  
   Solve for \(p\):  
   \[
   p = \frac{139.6^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
   \]

7. **Substitute Values:**  
   - \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2\)  
   - \(139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2\)  
   - \(p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}\)

8. **Energy of the \(\mu^+\):**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{887.0867 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.5767} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

9. **Kinetic Energy of the \(\mu^+\):**  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

10. **Energy of the \(\nu\):**  
    Since \(E_{\nu} = p\), the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:  
    \[
    KE_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}
    \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, actually, the notation here is a bit confusing. Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino? Or maybe it's a different particle. Hmm, but I think it's a muon plus a neutrino. 

So, the problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary, which probably means it's at rest when it decays. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm not sure what the rest mass of the neutrino is, but since it's a neutrino, maybe it's considered to be negligible? Or perhaps it's treated as having zero rest mass. Because neutrinos are super light, right? Or maybe in some cases, they approximate it as zero for these kinds of calculations. That would make sense because otherwise, we’d need its mass, which isn't given here. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

Wait, but the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. So, the products are a muon and a neutrino. Since the Pi is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So their momenta vectors add up to zero.

Now, the question is to find the kinetic energy of each product. So kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. Since the Pi is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

But wait, when a particle at rest decays, the sum of the rest masses of the products must be less than or equal to the rest mass of the parent. Let me check: the muon is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino has negligible mass. So 105.7 is less than 139.6, which makes sense. So the decay is possible, and the remaining energy will be the kinetic energy of the products.

So the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is a relativistic particle (massless), its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c, but since I'm working in units where c=1, it's just |p| for the neutrino. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4), but again, with c=1, it's sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

But since the Pi is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the magnitude as p. So, p_mu = p, and p_nu = p in opposite direction.

So the total energy of the system is E_mu + E_nu = (sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)) + p.

This total energy must equal the rest energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. So:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, solving for p here. Let me write that equation again.

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me denote m_mu = 105.7, so:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi

Where M_pi is 139.6 MeV.

So I need to solve for p here. Let's let x = p.

So sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) + x = 139.6

Let me call sqrt(x^2 + a^2) = y, where a=105.7. So y = sqrt(x^2 + a^2).

Then y + x = M.

We can rearrange this as y = M - x.

Square both sides:

y^2 = (M - x)^2

Which is x^2 + a^2 = M^2 - 2 M x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

a^2 = M^2 - 2 M x.

So rearranging terms:

2 M x = M^2 - a^2

x = (M^2 - a^2) / (2 M)

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 139.6, a = 105.7.

M^2 = (139.6)^2 = let me compute that.

139.6 * 139.6: 

Well, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, a^2 = (105.7)^2.

105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7 = 147. So (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So M^2 = 19488.16, a^2 = 11172.49.

M^2 - a^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) 

Calculating denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2:

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. Let's see:

279.2 * 29.75 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate 8315.67 / 279.2.

Approximating:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8

279.2 * 0.75 = 209.4

So 29.75 * 279.2 = 8096.8 + 209.4 = 8306.2.

Hmm, 8306.2 is a bit less than 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 - 8306.2 = 9.47.

So 9.47 / 279.2 ≈ 0.034.

So x ≈ 29.75 + 0.034 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV. That is, p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So the momentum of the muon is about 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.784 squared: approximately (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ around 887.086656.

Wait, but 29.784 is actually, let me compute with more precision.

29.784^2 = (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.216^2.

30^2 = 900.

2*30*0.216 = 12.96.

0.216^2 = 0.046656.

So 900 - 12.96 = 887.04; plus 0.046656 = 887.086656.

So 29.784^2 ≈ 887.0867.

And 105.7^2 is 11172.49 as computed earlier.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.0867 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.5767).

What's the square root of 12059.5767?

Well, sqrt(12100)=110, because 110^2=12100. So 12059.5767 is a bit less than that.

110^2 = 12100 → 12100 - 40.4233 = 12059.5767.

So sqrt(12059.5767) ≈ 109.799 MeV.

Wait, approximately, because 109.8^2 is (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

Wait, but our value is 12059.5767, which is a bit higher than 12056.04.

So (109.8)^2=12056.04.

109.8 + x squared would be closer. Let me compute 109.8^2=12056.04.

We need to find x such that (109.8 + x)^2 = 12059.5767.

Expanding: (109.8)^2 + 2*109.8 x + x^2 = 12059.5767.

We have 12056.04 + 219.6 x + x^2 = 12059.5767.

Assuming x is small, x^2 is negligible.

So 219.6 x ≈ 12059.5767 - 12056.04 = 3.5367.

x ≈ 3.5367 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So the sqrt is approximately 109.8 + 0.0161 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu.

m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Hmm, but wait, what about the neutrino's kinetic energy?

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, since its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

But wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Which matches the numbers I just calculated (4.12 MeV and about 29.8 MeV). But wait, the question says "Find KE of product particles", but it's giving two options, which I think are the KEs of the two products. So the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's is about 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option is D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistake.

Hmm, another approach: Let's compute E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

Wait, no, earlier I set up the equation as sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

Wait, but E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu = p.

So total energy is E_mu + E_nu = M_pi.

So that equation was correct.

Let me check the calculation for x again.

x = (M^2 - a^2)/(2M) = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/(2*139.6).

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784.

Yes, that's correct.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(887 + 11172) ≈ sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's the one.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The rest mass of the \(\mu^+\) is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's rest mass is assumed to be negligible.

### Key Observations:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy of the system after the decay equals the rest energy of the \(\pi^+\), which is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\).  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, the momenta of the \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let the magnitude of the momentum be \(p\).

3. **Energy of the \(\mu^+\):**  
   The total energy of the \(\mu^+\) is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]  
   where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

4. **Energy of the \(\nu\):**  
   Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its total energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p
   \]

5. **Equation for Total Energy:**  
   Substituting \(E_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = 139.6
   \]

6. **Solving for \(p\):**  
   Rearrange the equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = 139.6 - p
   \]  
   Square both sides:  
   \[
   p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
   \]  
   Expand and simplify:  
   \[
   p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2
   \]  
   Cancel \(p^2\):  
   \[
   m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
   \]  
   Solve for \(p\):  
   \[
   p = \frac{139.6^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
   \]

7. **Substitute Values:**  
   - \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2\)  
   - \(139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2\)  
   - \(p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}\)

8. **Energy of the \(\mu^+\):**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{887.0867 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.5767} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

9. **Kinetic Energy of the \(\mu^+\):**  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

10. **Energy of the \(\nu\):**  
    Since \(E_{\nu} = p\), the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:  
    \[
    KE_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}
    \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
