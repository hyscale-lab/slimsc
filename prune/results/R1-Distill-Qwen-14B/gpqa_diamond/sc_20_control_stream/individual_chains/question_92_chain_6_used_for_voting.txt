Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me visualize it. It looks like a di-substituted diene or maybe a more complex structure with multiple double bonds or substituents.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. Enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in an element to produce isolated atoms. For carbon, that's given as 1000 kJ/mol. 

The bond energies provided are for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So, the approach here is probably to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and relate that to the enthalpy of formation. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the enthalpy of formation calculation might involve subtracting bond energies from atomization energies.

Let me think. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The general formula I remember is:

ΔH_f° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactant bonds) ] - [Σ (Bond energies of product bonds) ]

Wait, no, actually, more accurately, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by taking the sum of the bond energies of the reactant molecules, subtracting the bond energies of the product molecules, but I might have that backwards. Alternatively, I think the formula involves using the atomization enthalpy and then considering the bonds in the molecules.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be found by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (atomization) and then subtracting the bond energies in the compound. So, for a molecule, you take the sum of the bond energies that are broken in the reactants (the elements) and subtract the bond energies formed in the product.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula:

ΔH_f = (Σ Bond energies in elements) - (Σ Bond energies in compounds)

But wait, the elements are in their standard form. For example, carbon is an element, but how is it bonded? Well, in the standard state, carbon is graphite, which has C-C bonds. But for atomization, we're breaking all bonds. So, for each mole of carbon, the atomization energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom has 4 bonds in graphite (each C has four bonds in a tetrahedral structure? Wait, no, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others in a hexagonal lattice. So each C has three bonds. So the enthalpy of atomization would be the energy to break all C-C bonds to make isolated C atoms.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think differently. For the given molecule, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The standard approach for this is the following:

The enthalpy of formation of a molecule is equal to the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule subtracted from the sum of the bond energies of the elements in their standard states (which are broken to form the molecule).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation can also be calculated using the atomization approach. The formula is:

ΔH_f°(molecule) = [Σ (Atoms' atomization energies) ] - [Σ (Bond energies in molecule) ]

Wait, that makes sense. Because to form the molecule, you first atomize the elements (breaking all bonds, which requires energy) and then form the bonds in the molecule (which releases energy if bonds are formed). So in terms of calculation, you take the sum of the atomization energies of all the constituent atoms and subtract the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

Wait, but for molecules like CH3CH2CH3, for example, the calculation would involve:

Each C comes from graphite, so each C atom's atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. Hydrogen comes from H2, so each H atom requires 100 kJ/mol (since bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, so each H atom is 50 kJ? Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The bond energy is the energy needed to break a bond. So for H2, bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms. So each H atom is 50 kJ/mol. Wait, but in the problem, the bond energies are given per mole of bonds. So for H-H, each bond is 100 kJ per mole of H2 molecules. So for each H atom, it's 50 kJ per mole of atoms, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the total energy needed to break all the bonds in the elements to get the atoms, then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.

So, for the given molecule, let's count the number of each type of bond and then calculate the total bond energy in the molecule. Then, the enthalpy of formation would involve subtracting that total from the sum of the atomization energies of all the atoms in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_f = [Σ (Atomization energies of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies in compound)] 

But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me try to find the correct approach.

Wait, another way: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula:

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

But wait, that's for a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the standard bonds in the elements and the bonds formed in the molecule.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for each element, we have to consider how many bonds are broken and how many are formed.

Wait, but for carbon, in its standard state (graphite), each carbon is bonded to three others (each C has three bonds in graphite). So in graphite, each C-C bond is present. So, for each C atom, the number of C-C bonds broken during atomization is 3/2 per C atom because each bond is shared between two C atoms.

Wait, perhaps I should model the calculation as follows:

1. Calculate the total energy required to break all bonds in the elements (atomization energy).
2. Subtract the total energy of all bonds formed in the molecule.

So, for a molecule with n C atoms and m H atoms, the total atomization energy would be (n * atomization energy of C) + (m * (1/2) * bond energy of H-H). Because each H2 molecule gives two H atoms, so per H atom, it's 50 kJ (since 100 kJ per mole of H2 → 100 kJ per 2 moles H atoms → 50 kJ per mole H atom).

Then, the total bond energy in the molecule is the sum of all the bond energies present in the molecule.

So, the formula would be:

ΔH_f = [n * (C atomization energy) + m * (H atomization energy)] - [sum of all bond energies in the molecule]

But wait, in this problem, the atomization energy of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So for each mole of carbon atoms, it's 1000 kJ. For hydrogen, since H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, each H atom would require 50 kJ (because 100 kJ breaks a H2 into 2 H atoms, so per H atom, 50 kJ).

But wait, the way the question is phrased, it gives the bond energies as per mole of bonds. So, for H-H, each bond is 100 kJ/mol. So when you break a H2 molecule, which has one H-H bond, it takes 100 kJ. So each H atom is 50 kJ (100 kJ per 2 H atoms).

So, for each carbon in the molecule, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. So, if the molecule has, say, 8 C atoms, that's 8 * 1000 kJ = 8000 kJ.

For each hydrogen atom, it's 50 kJ (since each H atom comes from breaking H2, which costs 100 kJ per mole of H2 → 50 kJ per H atom).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Let's say the molecule has m H atoms. Each comes from H2, so the number of H2 molecules is m/2. Each H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, so the total H atomization energy is (m/2) * 100 kJ.

So, the total H atomization energy is (m/2) * 100 kJ.

Similarly, the total C atomization energy is n * 1000 kJ, where n is the number of C atoms.

So, the total atomization energy is: n*1000 + (m/2)*100.

Then, the total bond energy in the molecule is the sum of all the bond energies present in the molecule. So, for each type of bond (C-C, C=C, C-H), multiply the number of such bonds by their respective bond energies.

So, the total bond energy in the molecule is:

sum = (number of C-C bonds * 200) + (number of C=C bonds * 300) + (number of C-H bonds * 400).

Then, the enthalpy of formation is (total atomization energy) - (sum of bond energies in molecule).

So, ΔH_f = [n*1000 + (m/2)*100] - [sum]

Now, let's apply this to the given molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let me parse the structure. It's a bit complex. Let me try to write the structure properly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure or at least count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds present.

Another approach: Let's count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

First, the molecule seems to have multiple double bonds and substituents. Let's count the number of each bond.

Let me try to think about each part. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of each type of bond by considering the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

I think the structure is such that there's a double bond between two carbons, then a single bond chain, then another double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else.

But perhaps a better approach is to count each type of bond:

1. C-C single bonds: How many are there?

The molecule has a chain of carbons connected by single bonds, except for two double bonds.

Wait, each double bond (C=C) is between two carbons, so each double bond is a single bond in the chain? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think: each double bond is between two carbons, so the number of C-C single bonds would be the total number of single bonds in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the entire molecule as a series of carbons connected by single and double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-C bonds, C=C bonds, and C-H bonds.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of each bond type by considering each carbon's valency.

Each carbon has four bonds. So, for each carbon, the number of bonds can be counted, and from that, the total number of each bond type can be determined.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Let me try to count the bonds step by step.

First, let's figure out the number of carbons and hydrogens in the molecule.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 4 C (since (CH3)2C is three C's and the next CH is another, but wait, no: (CH3)2C is a central C connected to two CH3 groups. So that's one C (the central) plus two CH3 groups, each having a C. Wait, no: each CH3 is a methyl group, so for (CH3)2C=CH-, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count all the carbons:

- The central part is a C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond: (CH3)2C= so that's three C's in that part.

Then comes CH, which is one C.

Then CH2: another C.

Then CH(CH3): another C.

Then CH2: another C.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: that's two C's (the central CH and the C with the double bond and two CH3 groups).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : that's four C's? Well, the central C (connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to CH). So that's 1 C (the central) plus two CH3 groups (each contributes a C), and the CH contributes another C. Wait, no: the (CH3)2C=CH- is a propene-like structure, so it's four C's in that part.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C in the entire molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can be considered as a longer chain with substituents, but perhaps it's better to count each part.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider each group.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count the total number of C and H atoms.

Looking at the formula:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has:

- The central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to CH.

So, number of C in (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 has 1 C, and there are two of them. So 2 C's.

The central C is 1.

The CH is another C.

So, 2 + 1 + 1 =4 C's in that part.

Then, the next part is CH2-.

That's one C.

Then CH(CH3)-: another C.

Then CH2-: another C.

Then CH=C(CH3)2.

The CH has one C, and the C with the double bond and two CH3 groups is another C.

So, 1 (CH) + 1 (C with double bond and CH3 groups) = 2 C's.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each C in the entire molecule.

Wait, the entire formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each C is:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 4 C (the two CH3 groups, the central C, and the CH)
- CH2-: 1 C
- CH(CH3)-: 1 C (the CH)
- CH2-: 1 C
- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the CH and the C with double bond)

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think again. The entire molecule is:

The first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → that's four C's (the two CH3 groups, the central C, and the CH).

Then, CH2- → another C.

Then CH(CH3)- → another C.

CH2- → another C.

CH=C(CH3)2 → that's two C's (the CH and the C with the double bond and two CH3 groups).

So, adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 +1 +2 = 9 C's.

Wait, but wait, each CH3 group is a methyl, which is a C connected to three H and one C.

So, the first group: (CH3)2C=CH- → that's 3 C's in (CH3)2C, plus the CH, so 4 C's.

The rest is a chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking down:

CH2-: 1 C.

CH(CH3)-: 1 C.

CH2-: 1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's.

So, 4 (first group) + 1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH=C) = 9 C's.

So, n=9 C atoms.

Now, the number of H atoms.

Each CH3 group has 3 H's. The central C in (CH3)2C=CH- is connected to two CH3 groups, so that's 2 *3=6 H's. The CH part has 1 H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each part.

The entire formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the H's:

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3: 3 H, and there are two → 6 H.

The central C is connected to the CH group, which has 1 H.

So, 6 +1 =7 H.

Then, the CH2-: 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3)-: 1 H (on the CH) + 3 H from the CH3.

Wait, no: CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to CH3 and another C. So, that's 3 H's on the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, wait: the structure is CH(CH3), which is a central C connected to three H and one CH3 group. So, that's 3 H's.

Then, the next CH2-: 2 H.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 part: the CH has 1 H, and the C with the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 H's. So, 3 * 2 =6 H from the CH3 groups on the double-bonded C.

Wait, no: the structure is CH=C(CH3)2. So the C with the double bond is connected to one CH group and two CH3 groups. So, the CH has one H, and each CH3 contributes three H's.

So, the CH part contributes 1 H, and each CH3 contributes 3 H's, and there are two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6 H.

Plus the H on the CH.

Wait, but in the CH=C(CH3)2 group, the C with the double bond is connected to a CH group (which has 1 H) and two CH3 groups (each with 3 H). So, that part has 1 + (2*3) =7 H.

Wait, but the CH group is the first part of the CH=C(CH3)2, which is the CH connected to the previous CH2 group.

So, putting it all together:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count H's:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: each CH3 has 3 H → 2 *3=6. The CH has 1 H. → 6 +1=7 H.
- CH2-: 2 H.
- CH(CH3)-: the CH has 3 H. → 3 H.
- CH2-: 2 H.
- CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H → 2 *3=6. → 1 +6 =7 H.

So, adding them up:7 +2 +3 +2 +7 =21 H atoms.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some H's. Let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (CH3) +1 (CH) =7 H.
2. CH2-:2 H.
3. CH(CH3)-:3 H.
4. CH2-:2 H.
5. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, each CH3 has 3 → 2*3=6 → total 7 H.

Sum: 7 +2=9, 9+3=12, 12+2=14, 14+7=21 H atoms.

So, m=21 H atoms.

Now, let's calculate the atomization energy.

Total atomization energy = (n * 1000) + (m/2 * 100)

n=9, m=21.

So,

Atomization = 9 * 1000 + (21/2) * 100
= 9000 + (10.5) * 100
= 9000 + 1050
= 10050 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, n is the number of C atoms, which is 9, right? So, 9 * 1000 =9000.

m is 21, so (21/2) *100 = 10.5 *100=1050.

So, total atomization energy is 10050 kJ/mol.

Now, the next step is to calculate the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.

We need to count the number of each type of bond: C-C, C=C, C-H.

So, let's count each bond type.

Let me try to count each C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me visualize the structure. It's a chain with two double bonds. Let me write the structure:

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the structure is:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-
2. -CH2-
3. -CH(CH3)-
4. -CH2-
5. -CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's look for the bonds:

1. The first part: (CH3)2C=CH-

This has the double bond between the central C and the next C (C=C). So, that's one C=C bond.

Then, the central C (from (CH3)2C) is connected via single bonds to two CH3 groups and the double bond. So, the central C has two C-C bonds to the CH3 groups and one C=C bond.

Wait, each CH3 is connected via a single C-C bond. So, each CH3 contributes one C-C bond. So, for (CH3)2C, the central C has two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups) and one C=C bond (to the CH group).

Wait, not quite. The (CH3)2C=CH- part has the structure where the central C is connected via two single bonds to CH3 groups and a double bond to CH.

So, the central C has two C-C bonds (to CH3 groups) and one double bond (C=C) to the CH group.

Then, the CH group is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 group.

So, the CH group has a single bond to the next CH2.

Next, the CH2 group is connected to the CH(CH3) group via a single bond.

The CH(CH3) group is connected via a single bond to the next CH2.

The CH2 is connected to the CH part of the next group via a single bond.

The CH part is connected via a double bond to the C in the CH=C(CH3)2 group.

The C in CH=C(CH3)2 is connected via two C-C bonds (to each CH3 group).

So, now, let's count all the bonds.

We can proceed by each type.

C=C bonds:

In the molecule, there are two double bonds. Let me check.

In (CH3)2C=CH- ... and then ... CH=C(CH3)2.

So, two C=C bonds in the molecule.

So, number of C=C bonds: 2.

C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two C atoms counts as a C-C bond.

Let's count each single bond.

Let me try to list all the single C-C bonds.

1. Between the central C (from (CH3)2C) and each CH3 group → two C-C bonds.

2. Between the CH group and the next CH2 → one C-C bond.

3. Between the CH2 and the CH(CH3) → one C-C bond.

4. Between the CH(CH3) and the next CH2 → one C-C bond.

5. Between the CH2 and the CH in the CH=C part → one C-C bond.

6. In the CH=C(CH3)2 part, the C with the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Wait, but each CH3 group is connected via a single bond, so that's two C-C bonds.

So, adding up:

(2 in (CH3)2C) + (1 CH to CH2) + (1 CH2 to CH(CH3)) + (1 CH(CH3) to CH2) + (1 CH2 to CH=C) + (2 in CH=C's CH3) → 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me count again.

( (CH3)2C=CH- ) → (CH3)2C has two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups).

Then, the CH is connected to the next CH2 → that's another C-C bond.

CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) → another C-C.

CH(CH3) connected to next CH2 → another.

CH2 connected to CH=C → another.

CH=C is connected to two CH3 → two more.

So:

2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (CH-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3)-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH=C) +2 (CH=C-CH3 groups) → 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

So, 8 C-C single bonds.

C-H bonds:

Each C-H single bond.

Let's count each C that is connected to H's.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6.

The central C is connected to the CH group, which has 1 C-H bond.

The CH group has 1 C-H bond.

So, 6 +1 (from CH) →7 in this part.

2. CH2-: the CH2 has 2 C-H bonds.

3. CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 C-H bond.

4. CH2-: another 2 C-H bonds.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

The CH has 1 C-H bond.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6.

So, 1 +6=7 C-H bonds in this part.

Adding up:

Part 1:7

Part 2:2 → total 9.

Part3:1 →10.

Part4:2 →12.

Part5:7 →19.

So, total of 19 C-H bonds.

Wait, let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Each CH3:3 H →2 CH3 →6 C-H bonds.

- The CH has 1 C-H →1.

Total:7.

2. CH2-: 2 C-H → total 9.

3. CH(CH3)-:1 →10.

4. CH2-:2 →12.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH:1 →13.

- Each CH3:3 →2*3=6 →13+6=19.

So, yes, 19 C-H bonds.

Now, the bond energies:

C=C: 300 kJ/bond → 2 bonds → 2 *300 =600 kJ.

C-C: 200 kJ/bond →8 bonds →8 *200=1600 kJ.

C-H:400 kJ/bond →19 bonds →19 *400=7600 kJ.

So, total bond energy in the molecule is:

600 + 1600 +7600 = 9800 kJ.

So, sum of bond energies = 9800 kJ.

Now, the enthalpy of formation is:

ΔH_f = (Atomization energy) - (sum of bond energies)

Atomization energy is 10050 kJ.

Sum of bond energies is 9800 kJ.

So, ΔH_f = 10050 - 9800 = 250 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, 250 kJ/mol isn't one of them. The options are A)11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, something's wrong. Did I make a mistake in counting the bonds?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, let me double-check the bond counts.

Starting with C=C bonds: the molecule has two double bonds, so 2 C=C bonds. That seems correct.

C-C bonds: 8. Let me recount:

(CH3)2C=CH- → two C-C (to CH3 groups) → 2.

CH=CH2 → one C-C.

CH2-CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3)-CH2 →1.

CH2-CH=C →1.

CH=C attached to two CH3 groups → two C-C.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+2=8. Correct.

C-H bonds:19 → seems correct.

So, sum of bond energies: 2*(300) +8*(200) +19*(400) =600 + 1600 +7600=9800.

Atomization:9*1000 + (21/2)*100 → 9000 +1050=10050.

So, ΔH_f =10050 -9800=250 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match 250 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the enthalpy of formation is calculated. Oh wait! Perhaps I should subtract the bond energies from the atomization energy, but wait, maybe the formula is the other way around.

Wait, the correct formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants (elements)] - [sum of bond energies of products (molecule)].

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. When you form bonds, energy is released. So, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (atomization) minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies in elements) - (sum of bond energies in molecule)

Wait, but the bond energies in elements are the bonds that are broken. So, for example, for C, each bond in graphite (C-C) is broken, and for H, the H-H bonds are broken.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_f = [n*(C atomization) + m*(H atomization)] - [sum of bond energies in molecule].

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but in that case, 10050 -9800=250 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 250. Hmm.

Let me re-examine the given molecule. Did I count the bonds correctly?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, in the molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me re-express the structure to make sure I'm not missing any bonds.

Each single bond between C atoms is a C-C bond. Let's count them again step by step.

1. Between (CH3)2C and the next C (CH) → that's a double bond, not a single. So, no C-C here; it's a C=C.

So, the C-C bonds are:

- Each CH3 is connected to the central C → 2 C-C bonds.

- CH connected to CH2 → 1 C-C.

- CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

- CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

- CH2 connected to CH=C →1.

- The two CH3 groups attached to the C in CH=C →2 C-C bonds.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+2=8. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, the molecule may have more C-C bonds than I counted. Let me try a different approach.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C-C bond:

1. (CH3)2C has two C-C bonds to CH3 groups.

2. The CH in (CH3)2C=CH- is connected to the next CH2 → one C-C.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → one C-C.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 → one.

5. CH2 connected to CH=C → one.

6. The CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C.

So, that's 2+1+1+1+1+2=8, same as before.

Hmm. So, the sum of bond energies is correct.

Wait, perhaps the number of H's is incorrect. Let me recount the H's.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has:

- Two CH3 groups → 2*3=6 H.

- CH has 1 H → total 7 H.

CH2- → 2 H.

CH(CH3)- → the CH has 3 H.

CH2- → 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:

CH has 1 H.

Each CH3 has 3 H → 2*3=6 H.

So, 7+2+3+2+7=21 H. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem considers H's as diatomic molecules, so the H atomization is per H atom, but perhaps I should have used H2's bond energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is reversed. Maybe I should subtract the atomization energy from the bond energies. Or perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, the correct formula for the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔH_f = [sum (bond energies of elements)] - [sum (bond energies of compound)].

Wait, but the bond energies of the elements are the bonds that are broken to form the atoms. So, for carbon, the bonds in graphite are broken, and for hydrogen, H-H bonds are broken.

So, for each C atom, it costs 1000 kJ to break all the bonds in graphite to form an atom. For each H atom, it's 50 kJ (since each H2 molecule has one bond of 100 kJ, so per H atom, 50 kJ).

So, the total bond energy for the elements is:

n * (C atomization) + m * (H atomization) =9*1000 +21*(50) =9000 + 1050=10050 kJ.

The bond energy in the compound is 9800.

So, ΔH_f = 10050 -9800=250 kJ/mol.

But options don't have 250. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of bond energies. Let me re-calculate the sum.

C=C:2 bonds →2*300=600.

C-C:8 bonds →8*200=1600.

C-H:19 →19*400=7600.

Total:600+1600=2200; 2200+7600=9800. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of carbons or hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more carbons or hydrogens than I thought.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons again:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has 4 C's (two CH3, one C in the middle, one CH).

Then, each CH2 is one C.

Then, CH(CH3) is one C.

Another CH2 → one C.

Then, CH=C(CH3)2: two C's.

So, 4 +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH=C) = 9 C's. Correct.

H's: as before, 21.

So, I'm confident in the counts.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is in the way the question is phrased. The given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of C=C bonds again.

Looking at the formula, it's (CH3)2C=CH-... and ...CH=C(CH3)2. So, two double bonds. Correct.

Hmm. The answer I'm getting is 250 kJ/mol, which isn't among the options.

Looking at the options again:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → way too high.

B)67.4 kJ/mol → maybe.

C)11.44 kJ/g → Units are grams, but the question is in kJ/mol.

D)1900 kJ/g → Also grams, but question is per mole.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but my calculation gives 250.

Wait, perhaps I missed that the molecule has more C=C bonds. Let me check again.

In the molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

There are two double bonds, yes. So, two C=C bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the C-C count. Let me re-count each C-C bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Then, the CH is connected to the next CH2 → one C-C.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

CH2 connected to CH=C →1.

The CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Wait, that's 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds. Correct.

So, no mistake there.

Hmm. Since the correct calculation gives 250, which isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility that the molecule has more bonds than I counted. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule includes some other bonds, like between the CH2 groups and any other structures.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bond energies. Let me double-check:

C=C:300 each →2 *300=600.

C-C:200 each →8 *200=1600.

C-H:400 each →19 *400=7600.

Sum:600 +1600=2200; 2200+7600=9800.

Atomization:10050.

So, ΔH_f=10050-9800=250.

Hmm.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the formula is applied. Maybe the correct formula is the other way around: sum of bond energies in the molecule minus atomization energy.

Wait, if I do that, 9800−10050=−250 kJ/mol. Not matching the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies in elements] − [sum of bond energies in molecule]

Which is what I did. So, 10050−9800=250.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are not in kJ/mol but in some other unit. But the question states the units are kJ/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about enthalpy of formation of the molecule from its elements, but the units are per gram, not per mole. So, perhaps I should calculate per mole first, then convert to per gram.

Wait, but the options include some per gram units. Options C and D are per gram, but A and B are per mole.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is typically per mole.

Hmm. So, if the correct answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-H bonds than I thought. Let me recount the C-H bonds.

Looking again at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count each C-H bond:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 →3 H →2 CH3 →6.

The CH has 1 H →7.

2. CH2- →2 H →9.

3. CH(CH3)- →3 H →12.

Wait, no: CH(CH3) is a CH group with a CH3 substituent. So, the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H.

Wait, no: the CH(CH3) group is a carbon connected to another carbon (from the CH2 group) and a CH3 group, plus three H's? Or perhaps it's a CH group, which has 3 H's.

Wait, no, the structure is CH(CH3), which is a carbon attached to one CH2 group (from the previous CH2-), one CH3 group, and two H's. Oh wait, wait, no: the CH(CH3) group is a carbon with a CH3 group and two other substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: CH(CH3) would be a carbon connected to a CH3 group and two other C atoms (one from the previous CH2 and one from the next CH2), leaving one H. So, the CH(CH3) group has one H.

Wait, no. The structure is CH(CH3). So, the carbon is connected to three groups: the previous CH2, the next CH2, and a CH3 group. So, it has one H attached.

So, in CH(CH3), the carbon has:

- One bond to the previous CH2.

- One bond to the next CH2.

- One bond to the CH3 group.

- One H.

So, that's one H.

Similarly, each CH2 group has two H's.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has one H, and each CH3 has three.

So, let's recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

- 2 CH3 groups: 2 *3=6.

- The CH:1 →7.

2. CH2-:2 →9.

3. CH(CH3)-:1 →10.

4. CH2-:2 →12.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

- The CH:1 →13.

- 2 CH3 groups: 2 *3=6 →19.

So, 19 C-H bonds.

Hmm. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds than I thought. Let me think about the entire structure again. Are there any more C-C bonds beyond what I've counted?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups are connected in a way that I missed. For example, the chain might involve more C-C bonds.

Wait, another approach: for n carbons, the maximum number of C-C bonds in a chain would be (n-1). But that's only for a straight chain without branches.

Wait, in this molecule, the structure isn't a straight chain. It has branches, so the number of C-C bonds would be less than n-1.

Wait, but the molecule is:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, in terms of the backbone, it's:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the backbone is:

C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

Let me count the backbone C's:

1. C (from (CH3)2C)

2. C (from CH)

3. CH2's C

4. CH(CH3)'s C

5. CH2's C

6. CH's C

7. C (from C=CH3)2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should consider the entire molecule as a series of connected carbons and count the bonds between them.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the total valence method. Each C has four bonds. So, the total number of bonds can be calculated as (4n + 2m - bonds)/2, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is indeed 8, as I've counted.

Given that, I'm stuck because my calculation doesn't match any of the given options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the way I approached the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given molecule is a different structure. Let me re-examine the formula.

The given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps this is a typo, and the correct structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

But without more information, I can't change the structure.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation. But the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of formation".

Wait, no, the question is definitely about the enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is reversed. Maybe the sum is (sum of bond energies in molecule) minus (sum of bond energies in elements).

In that case, 9800−10050=−250.

But that's negative and not among the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the bond energies are given per mole of bonds, but the atomization energy is per mole of atoms.

Wait, no, the atomization energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So, per mole of C atoms, 1000 kJ is needed.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation in kJ per gram, but I calculated it per mole.

Wait, I can calculate it per gram. Let's see. The molecular weight would be (12 *9) + (1 *21) =108 +21=129 g/mol.

So, 250 kJ/mol is 250 /129 ≈1.938 kJ/g.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:11.44 kJ/g, but that's way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole. But the question states "Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol", which implies per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are per bond, not per mole. Let me re-calculate assuming that.

Wait, if the bond energies are given per bond, then:

H-H:100 kJ per bond.

C-C:200 per bond.

C=C:300 per bond.

C-H:400 per bond.

Wait, that can't be, because 1 mole of H-H bonds would be 100 kJ per mole, so per bond, it's (100 kJ/mol) / (1 mole of H2 →1 mole of bonds) →100 kJ per bond. So, perhaps the given bond energies are per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

An alternative approach is to use the formula:

ΔH_f = (Σ bond energies of elements) − (Σ bond energies of molecule)

Which is what I did, but in this case, it's giving 250, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule in terms of the elements, but with a different approach, considering the molecule as a combination of smaller molecules.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the molecule as being built from its constituent parts, like ethylene or propane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the bond energies for the entire molecule and then subtract that from the sum of the bond energies of the elements (atomization energies).

Wait, but I think that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula, and the correct formula is:

ΔH_f = [sum (elements' bond energies)] − [sum (molecule's bond energies)].

Which is what I did. So, 10050−9800=250.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, perhaps option B is the closest, but that's not correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that all C-C bonds in the molecule are single bonds, but I counted 8, but perhaps the correct count is higher. Let me recount.

If the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, perhaps the structure includes more C-C bonds than I thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing one C-C bond. Let's see.

Wait, for example, the CH2-CH(CH3) might have a C-C bond, but perhaps there's another bond I missed.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds due to branching.

But without the actual structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol. How would that be achieved?

Let me see what would give 67.4.

Suppose the sum of bond energies were 9372.6 kJ. Because 10050−9372.6=677.4, which is approx 67.4 if I made a mistake in decimal placement. But 67.4 would be if the sum were 9382.6.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. If the number of C-C bonds is 9 instead of 8, the sum would be 9*200=1800. Then, total bond energy would be 600+1800+7600=10000. So, ΔH_f=10050−10000=50 kJ/mol. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if there are 7 C-C bonds:

7 *200=1400.

Sum:600+1400+7600=9600.

ΔH_f=10050−9600=450. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B)67.4. Let me see what that would require.

67.4 kJ/mol.

So, 10050−sum =67.4 →sum=10050−67.4=9982.6.

But my sum is 9800. So, there's a difference of 182.6 kJ.

Hmm. Where could that discrepancy come from?

Ah! Wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds. Let me recount them carefully.

In the molecule:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3:3 H →2 →6.

CH:1 →7.

2. CH2:2 →9.

3. CH(CH3):1 →10.

4. CH2:2 →12.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

CH:1 →13.

Each CH3:3 H →2 →6 →19.

So, 19 C-H bonds.

But wait, perhaps the CH=C(CH3)2 group has a different structure. Maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)2. If that's the case, the CH has two H's, but that's unlikely. No, the formula is written as CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the C=C in CH=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, each contributing three H's, so 2 *3=6 H. Plus the CH has one H. So, that's 7 H in that part.

So, I think the count is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H's. Let me recount:

Each CH3 group has 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups: let's count.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: two CH3 →6 H.

In CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 →6 H.

Total CH3 H:12.

The other H's come from:

- The CH groups: in (CH3)2C=CH- →1 H.

- CH2 groups: each has 2 H.

In the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH- →1 H.

- CH2- →2 H.

- CH(CH3) →1 H.

- CH2- →2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2 →1 H.

So, other H's:

1 +2 +1 +2 +1 =7.

So, total H's:12 (from CH3) +7=19. Correct.

Hmm. I'm not finding any mistakes in the counting. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to 250 kJ/mol, which isn't an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, which is close to 67 kJ/mol, suggesting a miscalculation in bond counts.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the bond energies in a different way, such as per molecule rather than per mole.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are per bond, not per mole. Let me try that.

If, for example, H-H bond energy is 100 kJ per bond, then for m/2 H2 molecules → (m/2)*100 kJ.

Wait, but that might not be the case, as the question states "Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol", which implies per mole.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options. However, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds, leading to a different sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the C-C bonds one more time.

Looking at the molecule:

The (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups) and one C=C bond.

Then, the CH is connected to CH2 → one C-C.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → one.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 → one.

CH2 connected to CH=C → one.

CH=C connected to two CH3 → two C-C.

Total:2+1+1+1+1+2=8.

Correct.

Hmm.

Perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is B)67.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the number of atoms and the bond energies, but I can't figure out another way.

Given that, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the molecule **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were taken:

1. **Atomization Energy**:  
   The total atomization energy is calculated as the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (graphite for carbon and H₂ for hydrogen) to form isolated atoms.  
   - For carbon: \( n = 9 \) atoms, so \( 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - For hydrogen: \( m = 21 \) atoms, so \( \frac{21}{2} \times 100 = 1050 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Total atomization energy: \( 9000 + 1050 = 10050 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

2. **Bond Energies in the Molecule**:  
   The molecule contains:  
   - **C=C bonds**: 2 bonds, each with \( 300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - **C-C bonds**: 8 bonds, each with \( 200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 8 \times 200 = 1600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - **C-H bonds**: 19 bonds, each with \( 400 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 19 \times 400 = 7600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Total bond energy in the molecule: \( 600 + 1600 + 7600 = 9800 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Atomization Energy} - \text{Total Bond Energy in Molecule}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 10050 - 9800 = 250 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**: This is far too high and inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This is significantly lower than the calculated value of \( 250 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)** and **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: These are per gram values, while the question asks for per mole. Additionally, the calculated value of \( 250 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) does not align with these units.  

Given the discrepancy between the calculated value (\( 250 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)) and the provided options, none of the options are correct. However, if the closest match is to be chosen, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** might be intended, though it does not align with the calculations.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me visualize it. It looks like a di-substituted diene or maybe a more complex structure with multiple double bonds or substituents.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. Enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in an element to produce isolated atoms. For carbon, that's given as 1000 kJ/mol. 

The bond energies provided are for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So, the approach here is probably to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and relate that to the enthalpy of formation. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the enthalpy of formation calculation might involve subtracting bond energies from atomization energies.

Let me think. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The general formula I remember is:

ΔH_f° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactant bonds) ] - [Σ (Bond energies of product bonds) ]

Wait, no, actually, more accurately, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by taking the sum of the bond energies of the reactant molecules, subtracting the bond energies of the product molecules, but I might have that backwards. Alternatively, I think the formula involves using the atomization enthalpy and then considering the bonds in the molecules.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be found by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (atomization) and then subtracting the bond energies in the compound. So, for a molecule, you take the sum of the bond energies that are broken in the reactants (the elements) and subtract the bond energies formed in the product.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula:

ΔH_f = (Σ Bond energies in elements) - (Σ Bond energies in compounds)

But wait, the elements are in their standard form. For example, carbon is an element, but how is it bonded? Well, in the standard state, carbon is graphite, which has C-C bonds. But for atomization, we're breaking all bonds. So, for each mole of carbon, the atomization energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom has 4 bonds in graphite (each C has four bonds in a tetrahedral structure? Wait, no, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others in a hexagonal lattice. So each C has three bonds. So the enthalpy of atomization would be the energy to break all C-C bonds to make isolated C atoms.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think differently. For the given molecule, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The standard approach for this is the following:

The enthalpy of formation of a molecule is equal to the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule subtracted from the sum of the bond energies of the elements in their standard states (which are broken to form the molecule).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation can also be calculated using the atomization approach. The formula is:

ΔH_f°(molecule) = [Σ (Atoms' atomization energies) ] - [Σ (Bond energies in molecule) ]

Wait, that makes sense. Because to form the molecule, you first atomize the elements (breaking all bonds, which requires energy) and then form the bonds in the molecule (which releases energy if bonds are formed). So in terms of calculation, you take the sum of the atomization energies of all the constituent atoms and subtract the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

Wait, but for molecules like CH3CH2CH3, for example, the calculation would involve:

Each C comes from graphite, so each C atom's atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. Hydrogen comes from H2, so each H atom requires 100 kJ/mol (since bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, so each H atom is 50 kJ? Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The bond energy is the energy needed to break a bond. So for H2, bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms. So each H atom is 50 kJ/mol. Wait, but in the problem, the bond energies are given per mole of bonds. So for H-H, each bond is 100 kJ per mole of H2 molecules. So for each H atom, it's 50 kJ per mole of atoms, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the total energy needed to break all the bonds in the elements to get the atoms, then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.

So, for the given molecule, let's count the number of each type of bond and then calculate the total bond energy in the molecule. Then, the enthalpy of formation would involve subtracting that total from the sum of the atomization energies of all the atoms in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_f = [Σ (Atomization energies of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies in compound)] 

But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me try to find the correct approach.

Wait, another way: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula:

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

But wait, that's for a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the standard bonds in the elements and the bonds formed in the molecule.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for each element, we have to consider how many bonds are broken and how many are formed.

Wait, but for carbon, in its standard state (graphite), each carbon is bonded to three others (each C has three bonds in graphite). So in graphite, each C-C bond is present. So, for each C atom, the number of C-C bonds broken during atomization is 3/2 per C atom because each bond is shared between two C atoms.

Wait, perhaps I should model the calculation as follows:

1. Calculate the total energy required to break all bonds in the elements (atomization energy).
2. Subtract the total energy of all bonds formed in the molecule.

So, for a molecule with n C atoms and m H atoms, the total atomization energy would be (n * atomization energy of C) + (m * (1/2) * bond energy of H-H). Because each H2 molecule gives two H atoms, so per H atom, it's 50 kJ (since 100 kJ per mole of H2 → 100 kJ per 2 moles H atoms → 50 kJ per mole H atom).

Then, the total bond energy in the molecule is the sum of all the bond energies present in the molecule.

So, the formula would be:

ΔH_f = [n * (C atomization energy) + m * (H atomization energy)] - [sum of all bond energies in the molecule]

But wait, in this problem, the atomization energy of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So for each mole of carbon atoms, it's 1000 kJ. For hydrogen, since H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, each H atom would require 50 kJ (because 100 kJ breaks a H2 into 2 H atoms, so per H atom, 50 kJ).

But wait, the way the question is phrased, it gives the bond energies as per mole of bonds. So, for H-H, each bond is 100 kJ/mol. So when you break a H2 molecule, which has one H-H bond, it takes 100 kJ. So each H atom is 50 kJ (100 kJ per 2 H atoms).

So, for each carbon in the molecule, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. So, if the molecule has, say, 8 C atoms, that's 8 * 1000 kJ = 8000 kJ.

For each hydrogen atom, it's 50 kJ (since each H atom comes from breaking H2, which costs 100 kJ per mole of H2 → 50 kJ per H atom).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Let's say the molecule has m H atoms. Each comes from H2, so the number of H2 molecules is m/2. Each H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, so the total H atomization energy is (m/2) * 100 kJ.

So, the total H atomization energy is (m/2) * 100 kJ.

Similarly, the total C atomization energy is n * 1000 kJ, where n is the number of C atoms.

So, the total atomization energy is: n*1000 + (m/2)*100.

Then, the total bond energy in the molecule is the sum of all the bond energies present in the molecule. So, for each type of bond (C-C, C=C, C-H), multiply the number of such bonds by their respective bond energies.

So, the total bond energy in the molecule is:

sum = (number of C-C bonds * 200) + (number of C=C bonds * 300) + (number of C-H bonds * 400).

Then, the enthalpy of formation is (total atomization energy) - (sum of bond energies in molecule).

So, ΔH_f = [n*1000 + (m/2)*100] - [sum]

Now, let's apply this to the given molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let me parse the structure. It's a bit complex. Let me try to write the structure properly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure or at least count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds present.

Another approach: Let's count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

First, the molecule seems to have multiple double bonds and substituents. Let's count the number of each bond.

Let me try to think about each part. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of each type of bond by considering the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

I think the structure is such that there's a double bond between two carbons, then a single bond chain, then another double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else.

But perhaps a better approach is to count each type of bond:

1. C-C single bonds: How many are there?

The molecule has a chain of carbons connected by single bonds, except for two double bonds.

Wait, each double bond (C=C) is between two carbons, so each double bond is a single bond in the chain? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think: each double bond is between two carbons, so the number of C-C single bonds would be the total number of single bonds in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the entire molecule as a series of carbons connected by single and double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-C bonds, C=C bonds, and C-H bonds.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of each bond type by considering each carbon's valency.

Each carbon has four bonds. So, for each carbon, the number of bonds can be counted, and from that, the total number of each bond type can be determined.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Let me try to count the bonds step by step.

First, let's figure out the number of carbons and hydrogens in the molecule.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 4 C (since (CH3)2C is three C's and the next CH is another, but wait, no: (CH3)2C is a central C connected to two CH3 groups. So that's one C (the central) plus two CH3 groups, each having a C. Wait, no: each CH3 is a methyl group, so for (CH3)2C=CH-, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count all the carbons:

- The central part is a C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond: (CH3)2C= so that's three C's in that part.

Then comes CH, which is one C.

Then CH2: another C.

Then CH(CH3): another C.

Then CH2: another C.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: that's two C's (the central CH and the C with the double bond and two CH3 groups).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : that's four C's? Well, the central C (connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to CH). So that's 1 C (the central) plus two CH3 groups (each contributes a C), and the CH contributes another C. Wait, no: the (CH3)2C=CH- is a propene-like structure, so it's four C's in that part.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C in the entire molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can be considered as a longer chain with substituents, but perhaps it's better to count each part.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider each group.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count the total number of C and H atoms.

Looking at the formula:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has:

- The central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to CH.

So, number of C in (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 has 1 C, and there are two of them. So 2 C's.

The central C is 1.

The CH is another C.

So, 2 + 1 + 1 =4 C's in that part.

Then, the next part is CH2-.

That's one C.

Then CH(CH3)-: another C.

Then CH2-: another C.

Then CH=C(CH3)2.

The CH has one C, and the C with the double bond and two CH3 groups is another C.

So, 1 (CH) + 1 (C with double bond and CH3 groups) = 2 C's.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each C in the entire molecule.

Wait, the entire formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each C is:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 4 C (the two CH3 groups, the central C, and the CH)
- CH2-: 1 C
- CH(CH3)-: 1 C (the CH)
- CH2-: 1 C
- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the CH and the C with double bond)

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think again. The entire molecule is:

The first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → that's four C's (the two CH3 groups, the central C, and the CH).

Then, CH2- → another C.

Then CH(CH3)- → another C.

CH2- → another C.

CH=C(CH3)2 → that's two C's (the CH and the C with the double bond and two CH3 groups).

So, adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 +1 +2 = 9 C's.

Wait, but wait, each CH3 group is a methyl, which is a C connected to three H and one C.

So, the first group: (CH3)2C=CH- → that's 3 C's in (CH3)2C, plus the CH, so 4 C's.

The rest is a chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking down:

CH2-: 1 C.

CH(CH3)-: 1 C.

CH2-: 1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's.

So, 4 (first group) + 1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH=C) = 9 C's.

So, n=9 C atoms.

Now, the number of H atoms.

Each CH3 group has 3 H's. The central C in (CH3)2C=CH- is connected to two CH3 groups, so that's 2 *3=6 H's. The CH part has 1 H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each part.

The entire formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the H's:

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3: 3 H, and there are two → 6 H.

The central C is connected to the CH group, which has 1 H.

So, 6 +1 =7 H.

Then, the CH2-: 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3)-: 1 H (on the CH) + 3 H from the CH3.

Wait, no: CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to CH3 and another C. So, that's 3 H's on the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, wait: the structure is CH(CH3), which is a central C connected to three H and one CH3 group. So, that's 3 H's.

Then, the next CH2-: 2 H.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 part: the CH has 1 H, and the C with the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 H's. So, 3 * 2 =6 H from the CH3 groups on the double-bonded C.

Wait, no: the structure is CH=C(CH3)2. So the C with the double bond is connected to one CH group and two CH3 groups. So, the CH has one H, and each CH3 contributes three H's.

So, the CH part contributes 1 H, and each CH3 contributes 3 H's, and there are two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6 H.

Plus the H on the CH.

Wait, but in the CH=C(CH3)2 group, the C with the double bond is connected to a CH group (which has 1 H) and two CH3 groups (each with 3 H). So, that part has 1 + (2*3) =7 H.

Wait, but the CH group is the first part of the CH=C(CH3)2, which is the CH connected to the previous CH2 group.

So, putting it all together:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count H's:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: each CH3 has 3 H → 2 *3=6. The CH has 1 H. → 6 +1=7 H.
- CH2-: 2 H.
- CH(CH3)-: the CH has 3 H. → 3 H.
- CH2-: 2 H.
- CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H → 2 *3=6. → 1 +6 =7 H.

So, adding them up:7 +2 +3 +2 +7 =21 H atoms.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some H's. Let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (CH3) +1 (CH) =7 H.
2. CH2-:2 H.
3. CH(CH3)-:3 H.
4. CH2-:2 H.
5. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, each CH3 has 3 → 2*3=6 → total 7 H.

Sum: 7 +2=9, 9+3=12, 12+2=14, 14+7=21 H atoms.

So, m=21 H atoms.

Now, let's calculate the atomization energy.

Total atomization energy = (n * 1000) + (m/2 * 100)

n=9, m=21.

So,

Atomization = 9 * 1000 + (21/2) * 100
= 9000 + (10.5) * 100
= 9000 + 1050
= 10050 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, n is the number of C atoms, which is 9, right? So, 9 * 1000 =9000.

m is 21, so (21/2) *100 = 10.5 *100=1050.

So, total atomization energy is 10050 kJ/mol.

Now, the next step is to calculate the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.

We need to count the number of each type of bond: C-C, C=C, C-H.

So, let's count each bond type.

Let me try to count each C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me visualize the structure. It's a chain with two double bonds. Let me write the structure:

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the structure is:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-
2. -CH2-
3. -CH(CH3)-
4. -CH2-
5. -CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's look for the bonds:

1. The first part: (CH3)2C=CH-

This has the double bond between the central C and the next C (C=C). So, that's one C=C bond.

Then, the central C (from (CH3)2C) is connected via single bonds to two CH3 groups and the double bond. So, the central C has two C-C bonds to the CH3 groups and one C=C bond.

Wait, each CH3 is connected via a single C-C bond. So, each CH3 contributes one C-C bond. So, for (CH3)2C, the central C has two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups) and one C=C bond (to the CH group).

Wait, not quite. The (CH3)2C=CH- part has the structure where the central C is connected via two single bonds to CH3 groups and a double bond to CH.

So, the central C has two C-C bonds (to CH3 groups) and one double bond (C=C) to the CH group.

Then, the CH group is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 group.

So, the CH group has a single bond to the next CH2.

Next, the CH2 group is connected to the CH(CH3) group via a single bond.

The CH(CH3) group is connected via a single bond to the next CH2.

The CH2 is connected to the CH part of the next group via a single bond.

The CH part is connected via a double bond to the C in the CH=C(CH3)2 group.

The C in CH=C(CH3)2 is connected via two C-C bonds (to each CH3 group).

So, now, let's count all the bonds.

We can proceed by each type.

C=C bonds:

In the molecule, there are two double bonds. Let me check.

In (CH3)2C=CH- ... and then ... CH=C(CH3)2.

So, two C=C bonds in the molecule.

So, number of C=C bonds: 2.

C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two C atoms counts as a C-C bond.

Let's count each single bond.

Let me try to list all the single C-C bonds.

1. Between the central C (from (CH3)2C) and each CH3 group → two C-C bonds.

2. Between the CH group and the next CH2 → one C-C bond.

3. Between the CH2 and the CH(CH3) → one C-C bond.

4. Between the CH(CH3) and the next CH2 → one C-C bond.

5. Between the CH2 and the CH in the CH=C part → one C-C bond.

6. In the CH=C(CH3)2 part, the C with the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Wait, but each CH3 group is connected via a single bond, so that's two C-C bonds.

So, adding up:

(2 in (CH3)2C) + (1 CH to CH2) + (1 CH2 to CH(CH3)) + (1 CH(CH3) to CH2) + (1 CH2 to CH=C) + (2 in CH=C's CH3) → 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me count again.

( (CH3)2C=CH- ) → (CH3)2C has two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups).

Then, the CH is connected to the next CH2 → that's another C-C bond.

CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) → another C-C.

CH(CH3) connected to next CH2 → another.

CH2 connected to CH=C → another.

CH=C is connected to two CH3 → two more.

So:

2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (CH-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3)-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH=C) +2 (CH=C-CH3 groups) → 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

So, 8 C-C single bonds.

C-H bonds:

Each C-H single bond.

Let's count each C that is connected to H's.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6.

The central C is connected to the CH group, which has 1 C-H bond.

The CH group has 1 C-H bond.

So, 6 +1 (from CH) →7 in this part.

2. CH2-: the CH2 has 2 C-H bonds.

3. CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 C-H bond.

4. CH2-: another 2 C-H bonds.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

The CH has 1 C-H bond.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6.

So, 1 +6=7 C-H bonds in this part.

Adding up:

Part 1:7

Part 2:2 → total 9.

Part3:1 →10.

Part4:2 →12.

Part5:7 →19.

So, total of 19 C-H bonds.

Wait, let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Each CH3:3 H →2 CH3 →6 C-H bonds.

- The CH has 1 C-H →1.

Total:7.

2. CH2-: 2 C-H → total 9.

3. CH(CH3)-:1 →10.

4. CH2-:2 →12.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH:1 →13.

- Each CH3:3 →2*3=6 →13+6=19.

So, yes, 19 C-H bonds.

Now, the bond energies:

C=C: 300 kJ/bond → 2 bonds → 2 *300 =600 kJ.

C-C: 200 kJ/bond →8 bonds →8 *200=1600 kJ.

C-H:400 kJ/bond →19 bonds →19 *400=7600 kJ.

So, total bond energy in the molecule is:

600 + 1600 +7600 = 9800 kJ.

So, sum of bond energies = 9800 kJ.

Now, the enthalpy of formation is:

ΔH_f = (Atomization energy) - (sum of bond energies)

Atomization energy is 10050 kJ.

Sum of bond energies is 9800 kJ.

So, ΔH_f = 10050 - 9800 = 250 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, 250 kJ/mol isn't one of them. The options are A)11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, something's wrong. Did I make a mistake in counting the bonds?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, let me double-check the bond counts.

Starting with C=C bonds: the molecule has two double bonds, so 2 C=C bonds. That seems correct.

C-C bonds: 8. Let me recount:

(CH3)2C=CH- → two C-C (to CH3 groups) → 2.

CH=CH2 → one C-C.

CH2-CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3)-CH2 →1.

CH2-CH=C →1.

CH=C attached to two CH3 groups → two C-C.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+2=8. Correct.

C-H bonds:19 → seems correct.

So, sum of bond energies: 2*(300) +8*(200) +19*(400) =600 + 1600 +7600=9800.

Atomization:9*1000 + (21/2)*100 → 9000 +1050=10050.

So, ΔH_f =10050 -9800=250 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match 250 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the enthalpy of formation is calculated. Oh wait! Perhaps I should subtract the bond energies from the atomization energy, but wait, maybe the formula is the other way around.

Wait, the correct formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants (elements)] - [sum of bond energies of products (molecule)].

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. When you form bonds, energy is released. So, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (atomization) minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies in elements) - (sum of bond energies in molecule)

Wait, but the bond energies in elements are the bonds that are broken. So, for example, for C, each bond in graphite (C-C) is broken, and for H, the H-H bonds are broken.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_f = [n*(C atomization) + m*(H atomization)] - [sum of bond energies in molecule].

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but in that case, 10050 -9800=250 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 250. Hmm.

Let me re-examine the given molecule. Did I count the bonds correctly?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, in the molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me re-express the structure to make sure I'm not missing any bonds.

Each single bond between C atoms is a C-C bond. Let's count them again step by step.

1. Between (CH3)2C and the next C (CH) → that's a double bond, not a single. So, no C-C here; it's a C=C.

So, the C-C bonds are:

- Each CH3 is connected to the central C → 2 C-C bonds.

- CH connected to CH2 → 1 C-C.

- CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

- CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

- CH2 connected to CH=C →1.

- The two CH3 groups attached to the C in CH=C →2 C-C bonds.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+2=8. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, the molecule may have more C-C bonds than I counted. Let me try a different approach.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C-C bond:

1. (CH3)2C has two C-C bonds to CH3 groups.

2. The CH in (CH3)2C=CH- is connected to the next CH2 → one C-C.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → one C-C.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 → one.

5. CH2 connected to CH=C → one.

6. The CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C.

So, that's 2+1+1+1+1+2=8, same as before.

Hmm. So, the sum of bond energies is correct.

Wait, perhaps the number of H's is incorrect. Let me recount the H's.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has:

- Two CH3 groups → 2*3=6 H.

- CH has 1 H → total 7 H.

CH2- → 2 H.

CH(CH3)- → the CH has 3 H.

CH2- → 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:

CH has 1 H.

Each CH3 has 3 H → 2*3=6 H.

So, 7+2+3+2+7=21 H. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem considers H's as diatomic molecules, so the H atomization is per H atom, but perhaps I should have used H2's bond energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is reversed. Maybe I should subtract the atomization energy from the bond energies. Or perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, the correct formula for the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔH_f = [sum (bond energies of elements)] - [sum (bond energies of compound)].

Wait, but the bond energies of the elements are the bonds that are broken to form the atoms. So, for carbon, the bonds in graphite are broken, and for hydrogen, H-H bonds are broken.

So, for each C atom, it costs 1000 kJ to break all the bonds in graphite to form an atom. For each H atom, it's 50 kJ (since each H2 molecule has one bond of 100 kJ, so per H atom, 50 kJ).

So, the total bond energy for the elements is:

n * (C atomization) + m * (H atomization) =9*1000 +21*(50) =9000 + 1050=10050 kJ.

The bond energy in the compound is 9800.

So, ΔH_f = 10050 -9800=250 kJ/mol.

But options don't have 250. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of bond energies. Let me re-calculate the sum.

C=C:2 bonds →2*300=600.

C-C:8 bonds →8*200=1600.

C-H:19 →19*400=7600.

Total:600+1600=2200; 2200+7600=9800. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of carbons or hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more carbons or hydrogens than I thought.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons again:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has 4 C's (two CH3, one C in the middle, one CH).

Then, each CH2 is one C.

Then, CH(CH3) is one C.

Another CH2 → one C.

Then, CH=C(CH3)2: two C's.

So, 4 +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH=C) = 9 C's. Correct.

H's: as before, 21.

So, I'm confident in the counts.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is in the way the question is phrased. The given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of C=C bonds again.

Looking at the formula, it's (CH3)2C=CH-... and ...CH=C(CH3)2. So, two double bonds. Correct.

Hmm. The answer I'm getting is 250 kJ/mol, which isn't among the options.

Looking at the options again:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → way too high.

B)67.4 kJ/mol → maybe.

C)11.44 kJ/g → Units are grams, but the question is in kJ/mol.

D)1900 kJ/g → Also grams, but question is per mole.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but my calculation gives 250.

Wait, perhaps I missed that the molecule has more C=C bonds. Let me check again.

In the molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

There are two double bonds, yes. So, two C=C bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the C-C count. Let me re-count each C-C bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Then, the CH is connected to the next CH2 → one C-C.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

CH2 connected to CH=C →1.

The CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Wait, that's 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds. Correct.

So, no mistake there.

Hmm. Since the correct calculation gives 250, which isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility that the molecule has more bonds than I counted. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule includes some other bonds, like between the CH2 groups and any other structures.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bond energies. Let me double-check:

C=C:300 each →2 *300=600.

C-C:200 each →8 *200=1600.

C-H:400 each →19 *400=7600.

Sum:600 +1600=2200; 2200+7600=9800.

Atomization:10050.

So, ΔH_f=10050-9800=250.

Hmm.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the formula is applied. Maybe the correct formula is the other way around: sum of bond energies in the molecule minus atomization energy.

Wait, if I do that, 9800−10050=−250 kJ/mol. Not matching the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies in elements] − [sum of bond energies in molecule]

Which is what I did. So, 10050−9800=250.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are not in kJ/mol but in some other unit. But the question states the units are kJ/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about enthalpy of formation of the molecule from its elements, but the units are per gram, not per mole. So, perhaps I should calculate per mole first, then convert to per gram.

Wait, but the options include some per gram units. Options C and D are per gram, but A and B are per mole.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is typically per mole.

Hmm. So, if the correct answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-H bonds than I thought. Let me recount the C-H bonds.

Looking again at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count each C-H bond:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 →3 H →2 CH3 →6.

The CH has 1 H →7.

2. CH2- →2 H →9.

3. CH(CH3)- →3 H →12.

Wait, no: CH(CH3) is a CH group with a CH3 substituent. So, the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H.

Wait, no: the CH(CH3) group is a carbon connected to another carbon (from the CH2 group) and a CH3 group, plus three H's? Or perhaps it's a CH group, which has 3 H's.

Wait, no, the structure is CH(CH3), which is a carbon attached to one CH2 group (from the previous CH2-), one CH3 group, and two H's. Oh wait, wait, no: the CH(CH3) group is a carbon with a CH3 group and two other substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: CH(CH3) would be a carbon connected to a CH3 group and two other C atoms (one from the previous CH2 and one from the next CH2), leaving one H. So, the CH(CH3) group has one H.

Wait, no. The structure is CH(CH3). So, the carbon is connected to three groups: the previous CH2, the next CH2, and a CH3 group. So, it has one H attached.

So, in CH(CH3), the carbon has:

- One bond to the previous CH2.

- One bond to the next CH2.

- One bond to the CH3 group.

- One H.

So, that's one H.

Similarly, each CH2 group has two H's.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has one H, and each CH3 has three.

So, let's recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

- 2 CH3 groups: 2 *3=6.

- The CH:1 →7.

2. CH2-:2 →9.

3. CH(CH3)-:1 →10.

4. CH2-:2 →12.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

- The CH:1 →13.

- 2 CH3 groups: 2 *3=6 →19.

So, 19 C-H bonds.

Hmm. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds than I thought. Let me think about the entire structure again. Are there any more C-C bonds beyond what I've counted?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups are connected in a way that I missed. For example, the chain might involve more C-C bonds.

Wait, another approach: for n carbons, the maximum number of C-C bonds in a chain would be (n-1). But that's only for a straight chain without branches.

Wait, in this molecule, the structure isn't a straight chain. It has branches, so the number of C-C bonds would be less than n-1.

Wait, but the molecule is:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, in terms of the backbone, it's:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the backbone is:

C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

Let me count the backbone C's:

1. C (from (CH3)2C)

2. C (from CH)

3. CH2's C

4. CH(CH3)'s C

5. CH2's C

6. CH's C

7. C (from C=CH3)2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should consider the entire molecule as a series of connected carbons and count the bonds between them.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the total valence method. Each C has four bonds. So, the total number of bonds can be calculated as (4n + 2m - bonds)/2, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is indeed 8, as I've counted.

Given that, I'm stuck because my calculation doesn't match any of the given options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the way I approached the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given molecule is a different structure. Let me re-examine the formula.

The given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps this is a typo, and the correct structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

But without more information, I can't change the structure.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation. But the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of formation".

Wait, no, the question is definitely about the enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is reversed. Maybe the sum is (sum of bond energies in molecule) minus (sum of bond energies in elements).

In that case, 9800−10050=−250.

But that's negative and not among the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the bond energies are given per mole of bonds, but the atomization energy is per mole of atoms.

Wait, no, the atomization energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So, per mole of C atoms, 1000 kJ is needed.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation in kJ per gram, but I calculated it per mole.

Wait, I can calculate it per gram. Let's see. The molecular weight would be (12 *9) + (1 *21) =108 +21=129 g/mol.

So, 250 kJ/mol is 250 /129 ≈1.938 kJ/g.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:11.44 kJ/g, but that's way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole. But the question states "Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol", which implies per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are per bond, not per mole. Let me re-calculate assuming that.

Wait, if the bond energies are given per bond, then:

H-H:100 kJ per bond.

C-C:200 per bond.

C=C:300 per bond.

C-H:400 per bond.

Wait, that can't be, because 1 mole of H-H bonds would be 100 kJ per mole, so per bond, it's (100 kJ/mol) / (1 mole of H2 →1 mole of bonds) →100 kJ per bond. So, perhaps the given bond energies are per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

An alternative approach is to use the formula:

ΔH_f = (Σ bond energies of elements) − (Σ bond energies of molecule)

Which is what I did, but in this case, it's giving 250, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule in terms of the elements, but with a different approach, considering the molecule as a combination of smaller molecules.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the molecule as being built from its constituent parts, like ethylene or propane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the bond energies for the entire molecule and then subtract that from the sum of the bond energies of the elements (atomization energies).

Wait, but I think that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula, and the correct formula is:

ΔH_f = [sum (elements' bond energies)] − [sum (molecule's bond energies)].

Which is what I did. So, 10050−9800=250.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, perhaps option B is the closest, but that's not correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that all C-C bonds in the molecule are single bonds, but I counted 8, but perhaps the correct count is higher. Let me recount.

If the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, perhaps the structure includes more C-C bonds than I thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing one C-C bond. Let's see.

Wait, for example, the CH2-CH(CH3) might have a C-C bond, but perhaps there's another bond I missed.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds due to branching.

But without the actual structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol. How would that be achieved?

Let me see what would give 67.4.

Suppose the sum of bond energies were 9372.6 kJ. Because 10050−9372.6=677.4, which is approx 67.4 if I made a mistake in decimal placement. But 67.4 would be if the sum were 9382.6.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. If the number of C-C bonds is 9 instead of 8, the sum would be 9*200=1800. Then, total bond energy would be 600+1800+7600=10000. So, ΔH_f=10050−10000=50 kJ/mol. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if there are 7 C-C bonds:

7 *200=1400.

Sum:600+1400+7600=9600.

ΔH_f=10050−9600=450. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B)67.4. Let me see what that would require.

67.4 kJ/mol.

So, 10050−sum =67.4 →sum=10050−67.4=9982.6.

But my sum is 9800. So, there's a difference of 182.6 kJ.

Hmm. Where could that discrepancy come from?

Ah! Wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds. Let me recount them carefully.

In the molecule:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3:3 H →2 →6.

CH:1 →7.

2. CH2:2 →9.

3. CH(CH3):1 →10.

4. CH2:2 →12.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

CH:1 →13.

Each CH3:3 H →2 →6 →19.

So, 19 C-H bonds.

But wait, perhaps the CH=C(CH3)2 group has a different structure. Maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)2. If that's the case, the CH has two H's, but that's unlikely. No, the formula is written as CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the C=C in CH=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, each contributing three H's, so 2 *3=6 H. Plus the CH has one H. So, that's 7 H in that part.

So, I think the count is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H's. Let me recount:

Each CH3 group has 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups: let's count.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: two CH3 →6 H.

In CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 →6 H.

Total CH3 H:12.

The other H's come from:

- The CH groups: in (CH3)2C=CH- →1 H.

- CH2 groups: each has 2 H.

In the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH- →1 H.

- CH2- →2 H.

- CH(CH3) →1 H.

- CH2- →2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2 →1 H.

So, other H's:

1 +2 +1 +2 +1 =7.

So, total H's:12 (from CH3) +7=19. Correct.

Hmm. I'm not finding any mistakes in the counting. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to 250 kJ/mol, which isn't an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, which is close to 67 kJ/mol, suggesting a miscalculation in bond counts.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the bond energies in a different way, such as per molecule rather than per mole.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are per bond, not per mole. Let me try that.

If, for example, H-H bond energy is 100 kJ per bond, then for m/2 H2 molecules → (m/2)*100 kJ.

Wait, but that might not be the case, as the question states "Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol", which implies per mole.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options. However, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds, leading to a different sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the C-C bonds one more time.

Looking at the molecule:

The (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups) and one C=C bond.

Then, the CH is connected to CH2 → one C-C.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → one.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 → one.

CH2 connected to CH=C → one.

CH=C connected to two CH3 → two C-C.

Total:2+1+1+1+1+2=8.

Correct.

Hmm.

Perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is B)67.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the number of atoms and the bond energies, but I can't figure out another way.

Given that, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the molecule **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were taken:

1. **Atomization Energy**:  
   The total atomization energy is calculated as the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (graphite for carbon and H₂ for hydrogen) to form isolated atoms.  
   - For carbon: \( n = 9 \) atoms, so \( 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - For hydrogen: \( m = 21 \) atoms, so \( \frac{21}{2} \times 100 = 1050 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Total atomization energy: \( 9000 + 1050 = 10050 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

2. **Bond Energies in the Molecule**:  
   The molecule contains:  
   - **C=C bonds**: 2 bonds, each with \( 300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - **C-C bonds**: 8 bonds, each with \( 200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 8 \times 200 = 1600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - **C-H bonds**: 19 bonds, each with \( 400 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 19 \times 400 = 7600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Total bond energy in the molecule: \( 600 + 1600 + 7600 = 9800 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Atomization Energy} - \text{Total Bond Energy in Molecule}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 10050 - 9800 = 250 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**: This is far too high and inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This is significantly lower than the calculated value of \( 250 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)** and **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: These are per gram values, while the question asks for per mole. Additionally, the calculated value of \( 250 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) does not align with these units.  

Given the discrepancy between the calculated value (\( 250 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)) and the provided options, none of the options are correct. However, if the closest match is to be chosen, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** might be intended, though it does not align with the calculations.

ANSWER: B
