Okay, I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let's read it carefully and figure it out step by step.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. Half of one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing the star's brightness to vary periodically. The problem says this situation can mimic an exoplanet transit, but we need to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots.

The question is asking, what is the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is the fractional change in brightness, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this problem, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. So how does that work? Star spots are cooler regions, so when they rotate into view, the star appears a bit dimmer. The brightness variation would be due to the spots covering part of the star's surface.

The filling factor is given as 20%. I think the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 0.2, that would mean that on average, 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. But wait, in the problem, it's mentioned that only one hemisphere is covered. So perhaps the filling factor is per hemisphere? Or maybe the 20% is the average over the entire star. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered with spots. So each hemisphere is a sphere, so half the surface. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the entire star would have 10% of its surface covered? Because one hemisphere (half the surface) has 20% coverage. So total filling factor per hemisphere is 0.2, so total for the whole star would be 0.1. Or wait, maybe the problem says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere that is covered. So the hemisphere has 20% of its area in spots.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, okay, so the hemisphere (half the surface) has 20% of its area in spots. So the spots cover 20% of 50% of the surface, which is 10% of the total surface area. So the overall filling factor is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10%.

But wait, I'm not sure. The question might be that the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface. Because when it says one hemisphere is covered, maybe each spot is in that hemisphere, but the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere. So the problem says, the hemisphere (so half the star's surface area) is 20% filled with spots. So the total spot area is 20% of (πRstar² / 2) = 0.2 * (πRstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar². So the total spot area is 10% of the star's surface area.

Okay, moving on. The star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in the brightness. The amplitude of the variation depends on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

Wait, but in the case of a planet, the dip is simply the area blocked (since it's a solid body blocking light), while for spots, the dip depends on the difference in brightness between the spotted area and the rest.

So, the change in brightness when a spot is visible is given by the fraction of the star's area covered by spots multiplied by the difference in brightness per unit area.

The brightness per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: B = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the total brightness of the star without any spots is B_total = σ Teff^4 * (Surface area).

When spots are present, the brightness would be B_total = (Surface area without spots) * σ Teff^4 + (Surface area of spots) * σ T_spot^4.

So the change in brightness when spots are present is:

ΔB = (Surface area of spots) * (σ T_spot^4 - σ Teff^4).

The fractional change is ΔB / B_total.

Let me calculate that.

First, the surface area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The filling factor for the hemisphere is 20%, so the area covered in spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π R² /2 ) = wait, sorry, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2 π R². So, the area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait wait, no. Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But that's only for one hemisphere. So the total spot area is 0.4 π R².

But the star's entire surface is 4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%. Okay.

So the surface area of spots is 0.4 π R².

Now, the star's total brightness without spots is B_total = σ Teff^4 * 4 π R².

When spots are present, the brightness is B = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ T_spot^4.

So, the dip in brightness when spots are visible is ΔB = B_total - B.

So:

ΔB = [ (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ T_spot^4 ] 

But B_total is (4 π R²) σ Teff^4.

So, ΔB = (4 π R² σ Teff^4) - [ (3.6 π R² σ Teff^4) + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 ]

Which simplifies to:

ΔB = (4 π R² σ Teff^4) - 3.6 π R² σ Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4

ΔB = 0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)

So the fractional change is:

ΔB / B_total = [0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 π R² σ Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

= (0.4 * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4 Teff^4 )

= (0.4 /4 ) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

= 0.1 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ let's compute this.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

(25/36)^2 = 625/(36^2) → 625/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.51775 * 0.1 ≈ 0.051775.

So the fractional change is about 5.1775%.

Wait, but the problem says that this situation (spots) can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the dip in brightness caused by the spots should be similar to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

For a planet transit, the fractional dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Taking square root: Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.2275 isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Wait, the problem says the star is covered in spots, but the brightness variation observed is the same as what a planet would produce. So perhaps I should compute the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots, and set that equal to the amplitude caused by a planet.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. The star's brightness variation due to spots isn’t just the dip when the spots are fully in front, but the modulation as the spots rotate. Wait, but the question says that the brightness variation amplitude is the same as if a planet were transiting. So I should compute the amplitude of the star's brightness variation caused by the spots, and set that equal to the dip caused by a planet.

Wait, but I think I might have a confusion here. For a star with spots, the brightness variation is a dip when the spots are facing us. But the amplitude of the dip is the same as the star's dip when spots are in view. So the fractional dip is 5.1775% as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but wait: when the star is not covered by spots, the dip would be zero. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.1775%.

But for a planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So when the planet transits, the brightness drops by that amount, and that's the amplitude.

So, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But none of the options are near 0.23. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Let me recheck the steps.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the spot area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of (2 π R²) → 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

But the star's total surface area is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4 π R²)/(4 π R²) )= 0.1, or 10%.

So the area of spots is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the area is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of 4 π R². So that's correct.

Now, the change in brightness.

The total flux without spots: F_total = σ Teff^4 * 4 π R².

With spots, the flux is F = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So the dip is F_total - F = 0.4 π R² * σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

So the fractional dip is (0.4 π R² * σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)) / (4 π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify: (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)) / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.517747.

So the fractional dip is (0.4 /4 ) * 0.517747 → 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747, or ~5.18%.

So the fractional dip is about 5.18%, which is 0.0518.

So the planet's dip should be the same, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.228.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is D) ~0.32, which is larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area calculation. Let's think again.

The problem says one hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. So perhaps the filling factor is for the entire star, not the hemisphere. Wait, no, the problem says the hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spot area is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation observed is not the dip when the spots are in front, but the overall modulation due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But I'm not sure if that affects the amplitude calculation.

Wait, perhaps the way the spots rotate leads to a sinusoidal brightness variation. The amplitude of that variation is the same as the planet's dip. So the maximum dip is the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, but I'm not considering rotational modulation correctly. Wait, for a star with spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness to vary. The amplitude of this variation would depend on the spot coverage and the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the maximum decrease in brightness is when the spot area is fully blocking the hotter regions. But I think my initial approach was correct, calculating the dip when all spots are visible.

But perhaps I need to think about the ratio of the brightness change per unit area. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the overall change in brightness as a function of the spot coverage and the temperature ratio.

Another thought: perhaps the brightness variation due to spots is actually the same as the dip from a planet of radius Rpl, but I might have confused the calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the dip, but the change as the spots rotate, causing a periodic variation. So the amplitude of that variation (the peak-to-peak difference) is what's being compared to the planet's dip.

Wait, but for a planet, the dip is a flat decrease during transit, whereas for spots, the variation is a sinusoidal curve with the amplitude based on how much of the spots are visible as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is periodic, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. But I'm not sure how that would compare to the planet's dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's brightness variation as it rotates, with spots on one hemisphere. The star is a sphere, so as it rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip would be the same as when the planet transits.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the calculation is similar to the dip when the spots are fully in front of the star, which is the same as the planet's effect.

Wait, but my earlier calculation gives Rpl/Rstar ≈0.228, which is not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait another angle. Let me think: the problem says that the star's observed brightness variation (due to spots) is the same amplitude as a planet transit. So perhaps the maximum depth is the same. So the dip caused by the spots (when maximum spots are visible) is the same as the dip caused by a planet.

But perhaps the way the spots are arranged affects this. Alternatively, maybe I have the filling factor wrong.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% for the entire star, not just one hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So that implies that the hemisphere has a 20% filling factor of spots. So 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.

So the area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spots cover 0.4 π R² of the star's surface. The star's total surface area is 4 π R², so the fraction covered is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are 5000 K, and the star is 6000 K. So the flux difference is significant.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the flux from the entire star as the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the flux from the spots.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is:

F = (1 - f) * F_total + f * F_spot,

where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. F_total is the star's flux without spots. F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots.

So the fractional dip is (F_total - F) / F_total = [ F_total - (1-f) F_total - f F_spot ] / F_total = [ f (F_total - F_spot) ] / F_total.

Which is f * (1 - F_spot / F_total).

But F_spot / F_total is (T_spot^4 / Teff^4).

So the fractional dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4).

Wait, wait a minute. That's a different approach. Let me compute that.

f = 0.1 (10% coverage).

T_spot = 5000 K.

So (T_spot / Teff) = 5/6.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So fractional dip: 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, same as before.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the change in brightness as the spots rotate, leading to a varying brightness that reaches a maximum dip. But perhaps the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, not just the dip.

Wait, no. The peak-to-peak would involve the maximum dip (when spots are fully in front) and the brightness when the spots are behind (no dip). So the maximum dip is the same as before, and the amplitude would be the same as the dip.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the spots as the star rotates, and that this can be modeled as a sinusoidal variation with an amplitude equal to the dip. So the amplitude of the sinusoidal variation is the same as the planet's dip.

But for a spot on a star, the brightness variation due to rotation is a function of the spot's size and the temperature difference.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spot moves into and out of view. The maximum dip is when the spot is fully in front, but the brightness variation over time is a sine-like curve with the amplitude equal to the maximum dip.

So in that case, the amplitude (maximum dip) is the same as calculated.

So the planet's dip (maximum dip) should be equal to that.

Which brings us back to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the filling factor. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Problem states: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the hemisphere is 20% covered by spots. So the area is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Each hemisphere is a sphere of radius R, so surface area is 2 π R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

But the star's total surface area is 4 π R², so the spot coverage is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface. So that calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are cooler. So the star's flux is higher than when the spots are present.

But I think my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 'equivalent' planet radius that would cause the same amplitude as the brightness variation caused by the entire spot rotation.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation due to the spots as they rotate could be modeled as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude equal to the maximum dip.

The maximum dip is 5.1775%, as calculated.

So the planet's transit would cause the same dip, so the planet's radius would be such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But again, that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo and the options are different. Alternatively, perhaps I have miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation due to spots is twice the dip, because when the star rotates 180 degrees, the spots on the opposite hemisphere come into view, adding to the dip. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the same hemisphere comes into view, and as it's only one hemisphere, perhaps the maximum dip is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's surface has spots on both hemispheres, but each has 20% coverage. But the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the star's flux without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

The flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (area of spots) * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F) / F0 = [ (area_spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma ] / (F0).

Simplifying, it's (area_spots / (4 pi Rstar^2)) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Which is f * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ), where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

As earlier, f is 0.1 (10% coverage), and (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.48225. So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775. Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775.

So dip is 0.051775, or 5.1775%.

So for the planet, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way filling factor is applied. Let me think again.

Filling factor is the fraction of the surface area of the hemisphere that is spots. So if the hemisphere has 20% spots, the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

But the star's total area is 4 pi R², so the spot coverage is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1, which is 10% coverage.

So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation when the spots are on one hemisphere and the star is rotating, but the variation is not just the dip but the change as spots come into view. Maybe the variation would be modeled as a sine function with the amplitude equal to the dip.

Wait, but the amplitude is the same as the dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the maximum dip but the variation over a rotation period. For example, the brightness fluctuates as spots come into and out of view. But I think the maximum dip is when all the spots are in front, so the amplitude is the same as the dip.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking about the depth of the dip when the planet transits, which is the same as the dip caused by the spots. So the planet's radius must be such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, wait—could I have made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional dip? Let me recompute that.

The spots are 5000 K, star is 6000 K.

Compute (6000^4 - 5000^4) / 6000^4 = [6000^4 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ] /6000^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4.

Which is 1 - (625/1296) → (1296 - 625)/1296 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.51775.

So 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

That's about 5.1775% dip.

So the planet's dip must be 5.1775%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl ~ 0.2275 Rstar.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the star is only covered by spots on one hemisphere, but when it rotates, the spots are only visible once per rotation. So the dip is when the spots are in front, but the rest of the time, the star is at full brightness.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the dip when the spots are visible.

But maybe the problem is considering the entire period, so the average brightness is lower, but the variation is between the dip and the normal brightness.

Wait, but that would affect the average, not the amplitude of variation. The amplitude would be the same as the dip.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options: A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.32 is option D. That's approximately 0.32. If I have a (Rpl/Rstar) of 0.32, then the dip is (0.32)^2 = 0.1024, which is about 10.24% dip. But my calculation was about 5.18% dip.

So that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, meaning that the total spot coverage is 20% of the entire star. Let me consider that possibility.

If the entire star has 20% spot coverage, then f = 0.2.

So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) → 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355% dip.

Then, for the planet, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

So that would fit. But does the problem state that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, or 20% of the hemisphere?

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So that implies that the hemisphere has 20% coverage. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, but perhaps the problem considers the entire hemisphere as the spot coverage.

Wait, a hemisphere is half the star. So if the hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, then the entire star's filling factor is (20% * 0.5) = 10%.

So that gives the dip as 5.1775%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275, which isn't an option.

Wait, but what if the problem considers that the entire star's surface has a filling factor of 20%? Then the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the filling factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, but the rotational modulation creates a periodic variation with an amplitude equivalent to a planet's transit. The star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into view, leading to a dip of 5.1775%, while a planet's transit would have the same dip. So it's the same as before.

But in that case, the planet's Rpl/Rstar would be about 0.2275, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach was that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the spot coverage is 20% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of ~10%, Rpl/Rstar ~0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Filling Factor**:
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere. A hemisphere represents 50% of the star's surface area. Thus, the total fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{(or 10% of the star's surface)}.
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional change in brightness (\( \Delta B / B_{\text{total}} \)) when spots are visible is given by:
     \[
     \Delta B / B_{\text{total}} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333.
     \]
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
     \[
     \Delta B / B_{\text{total}} = 0.1 \cdot \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775 \, \text{(or ~5.18%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The fractional brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta B / B_{\text{total}}.
     \]
   - Setting \( \Delta B / B_{\text{total}} = 0.051775 \), we solve for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem instead assumes that the filling factor of 20% applies to the **entire star** (not just one hemisphere), the total surface coverage would be \( f = 0.2 \). Recomputing:
     \[
     \Delta B / B_{\text{total}} = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.10355 \, \text{(or ~10.36%)}.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]
   - This value aligns closely with option **D) ~0.32**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes that the filling factor of 20% applies to the entire star, not just one hemisphere. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.32 \).
