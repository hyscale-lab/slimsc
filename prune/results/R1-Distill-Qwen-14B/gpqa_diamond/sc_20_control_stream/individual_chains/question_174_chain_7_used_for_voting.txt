Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum should be zero after fission. Because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about the masses. The initial mass is M. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses. Let's call the smaller one m, so the larger is 2m. But the sum is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the larger fragment has mass 2m = 0.66 M, and the smaller is 0.33 M.

Wait, but wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the initial rest mass is M = 300 GeV/c², assuming c=1 in these units.

But after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Because the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial.

So the initial energy is all rest energy. After fission, the total rest energy is 297 GeV, but the nucleus was at rest, so total energy should be conserved. Wait, but the initial nucleus has rest energy 300 GeV, and after fission, the two fragments have rest energy 297 GeV plus their kinetic energies. So the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic energies should equal 300 GeV.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of energy and momentum.

The nucleus is initially at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. But since momentum is conserved, their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv². But considering relativity, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But first, maybe I should compute the velocities and kinetic energies using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches and then find the difference.

Wait, but the problem is about the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical approximation. So perhaps I should first calculate T1 using classical mechanics and then the correct relativistic value, then find the difference.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the velocities of the two fragments using conservation of momentum and energy—both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches.

2. Compute the kinetic energies for each case.

3. Find the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical T1.

But this might get complicated. Let me try to start.

First, using conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after fission is zero. Let me denote the more massive fragment as fragment A with mass mA = 0.66 M, and fragment B with mass mB = 0.33 M.

Let me say fragment A moves with velocity v, and fragment B with velocity V. Their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So:

mA * v = mB * V → 0.66 M * v = 0.33 M * V → 0.66 v = 0.33 V → V = 2v.

So B is moving twice as fast as A in the opposite direction.

Now, considering conservation of energy. The initial energy is the rest energy: 300 GeV.

The final energy is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments. So:

300 GeV = (mA c² + T1) + (mB c² + T2)

But wait, wait. The rest energy of each fragment is their rest mass times c². So:

Rest energy of A: mA c² = 0.66 M c². But M c² is 300 GeV, so 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV.

Similarly, rest energy of B: 0.33 * 300 = 99 GeV.

So sum of rest energies: 198 + 99 = 297 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV.

So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Now, in the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2) m v². But since we know the velocities are related by V=2v, as per momentum.

So for non-relativistic:

Kinetic energy of A: (1/2) mA v²

Kinetic energy of B: (1/2) mB V² = (1/2) mB (2v)^2 = (1/2) mB *4 v² = 2 mB v²

So total kinetic energy T = (1/2 mA v²) + 2 mB v².

But mA is 2 mB, since mA = 0.66 M, mB = 0.33 M → mA = 2 mB.

So substituting:

(1/2) (2 mB) v² + 2 mB v² = (mB v²) + 2 mB v² = 3 mB v².

And we know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

So 3 mB v² = 3 GeV → mB v² = 1 GeV.

But mB is 0.33 M, which is 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c².

So,

(99 GeV/c²) * v² = 1 GeV → v² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) → v² = (1/99) c².

So v = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c/(9.9499) ≈ 0.1005 c.

But this is the non-relativistic case, which may not hold if v is a significant fraction of c. Let's see: 0.1c is 3e8 m/s *0.1=3e7 m/s. Which is a high speed, so non-relativistic may not be a good approximation. So the relativistic calculation would have a significant difference.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So perhaps the non-relativistic approach is a first step, and then the relativistic approach is the next.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². Also, the momentum is gamma m v.

So let me model the relativistic situation.

Let me denote the velocity of fragment A as v, fragment B as V=2v as before.

The relativistic momentum of A is gamma_A * mA * v.

Similarly, for B: gamma_B * mB * V.

Since momentum must cancel, gamma_A mA v = gamma_B mB V.

But V is 2v, so:

gamma_A * mA * v = gamma_B * mB * 2v.

We can cancel v (assuming v ≠ 0, which it isn't).

So:

gamma_A * mA = 2 * gamma_B * mB.

But mA = 2 mB, so substituting:

gamma_A * 2 mB = 2 gamma_B mB → gamma_A = gamma_B.

So gamma factors are equal for both fragments.

Wait, that's interesting. So gamma_A = gamma_B.

Hmm. So both fragments have the same gamma.

That's a useful relation.

Now, the energy conservation equation: sum of energies is 300 GeV.

The energies are:

E_A = gamma_A mA c²,

E_B = gamma_B mB c².

Sum of energies:

gamma_A mA c² + gamma_B mB c² = 300 GeV.

But since gamma_A = gamma_B = gamma, and mA = 2 mB,

E_A + E_B = gamma (2 mB c² + mB c²) = gamma * 3 mB c².

But 3 mB = 0.99 M. Because earlier, 3 m = 0.99 M. Wait no, in this case, mB is 0.33 M. So 3 mB = M, right? Because 3 * 0.33 M = M (approx, since 0.333 *3=1). Hmm, but the initial statement says the sum is 0.99 M. So 3m =0.99 M → m = 0.33 M.

Wait, wait.

Earlier calculation: m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So mB is 0.33 M, mA is 0.66 M.

So 3 mB = 0.99 M.

So,

gamma * (0.99 M c²) ) = 300 GeV.

Because,

E_A + E_B = gamma*(2 mB c² + mB c²) = gamma*3 mB c²= gamma * 0.99 M c².

But M c² is 300 GeV, so:

gamma * 0.99 * 300 GeV = 300 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then:

gamma * 297 GeV = 300 GeV → gamma = 300 / 297 ≈ 1.0101.

Hmm, so gamma is approximately 1.0101.

So, gamma is just a bit larger than 1, which makes sense because the velocities aren't extremely high.

Wait, but this would imply that the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) mc².

So for fragment A, T1 = (gamma -1) mA c².

Similarly for fragment B, T2 = (gamma -1) mB c².

Since gamma is same for both, the kinetic energies are proportional to the rest masses.

So T1 = (gamma -1) * 0.66 M c²,

T2 = (gamma -1) * 0.33 M c².

The sum T1 + T2 = (gamma-1) (0.66 + 0.33) M c² = (gamma-1)(0.99 M c²).

We know that the sum of kinetic energies is 3 GeV, as earlier because 300 GeV - 297 GeV =3 GeV.

So,

(gamma -1) * 0.99 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

Because M c² is 300 GeV.

So, solving for gamma-1:

gamma -1 = 3 GeV / (0.99 * 300 GeV) ) → 3/(297) → 1/99 ≈ 0.010101.

So gamma ≈ 1.010101.

So gamma is about 1.0101.

So, the kinetic energy of fragment A:

T1 = (gamma -1) * mA c² → 0.010101 * 0.66 * 300 GeV.

Calculating that:

0.010101 * 0.66 = approx 0.00666666.

0.00666666 *300 = 2 GeV.

Wait, that's 2 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it accurately.

gamma -1 = 3/(0.99 *300) = 3/(297) = 1/99 ≈ 0.01010101.

So T1 = (1/99) * 0.66 *300 GeV.

0.66 *300 = 198 GeV.

198 /99 = 2 GeV.

So T1 is 2 GeV.

Wait, wait a minute. Because T1 + T2 =3 GeV, and since mA is twice mB, so T1 is twice T2.

So 2 GeV + 1 GeV =3 GeV. That makes sense.

So T1 is 2 GeV.

Now, what about the non-relativistic approximation?

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

Earlier, I found that v^2 = (1 GeV)/(99 GeV/c²) ) = (1/99) c².

So v = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c.

So T1 (non-relativistic) is (1/2) * mA * v².

mA is 0.66 M =0.66 *300 GeV/c² =198 GeV/c².

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * (c^2 /99).

Because v^2 is (c^2)/99.

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * 198 * (1/99) GeV.

198 /99 = 2 → (1/2)*2 =1 GeV.

So T1_classical is 1 GeV.

But the correct relativistic T1 is 2 GeV.

The difference between T1 and T1_classical is 2 GeV -1 GeV =1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's 1 GeV. But the options are in MeV. 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. But the options are A) 2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV.

Hmm, that's 1000 MeV difference, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so 0.99 *300=297 GeV.

The initial energy is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In the relativistic calculation, the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) times mass.

So T1 = (gamma-1)* mA c².

But with gamma-1 = 3 GeV / (0.99 M c²).

Wait, because the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So,

gamma-1 = (3 GeV) / ( (mA + mB) c² ) ) 

mA + mB is 0.99 M, so:

gamma-1 = 3 GeV / (0.99 *300 GeV) )= 3/(297) =1/99.

So yes, same as before.

So T1 is (1/99)*198 GeV = 2 GeV.

In non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

So the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should have considered relativistic treatment correctly.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic calculation isn't as straightforward. Because in non-relativistic, we have the velocities, but perhaps the kinetic energy expression is different.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the non-relativistic kinetic energies again.

In the non-relativistic case, momentum is conserved. So,

mA * v = mB * V → 0.66 M v = 0.33 M V → V = 2 v.

The kinetic energy of fragment A: (1/2) mA v²

Fragment B: (1/2) mB V² = (1/2) mB (2v)^2 =2 mB v².

Total kinetic energy: (1/2 mA v²) + 2 mB v².

Substituting mA=2 mB,

→ (1/2 * 2 mB) v² + 2 mB v^2 = mB v² + 2 mB v² =3 mB v².

We know that this sum is 3 GeV.

So,

3 mB v² =3 GeV → mB v² =1 GeV.

mB is 0.33 M =0.33 *300 GeV/c² =99 GeV/c².

So,

99 GeV/c² *v^2 =1 GeV → v^2 = (1 GeV )/(99 GeV/c²) )= (1/99) c^2.

So v= c/sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

Then, T1_classical is (1/2) mA v² = (1/2) * 0.66 M * (c² /99).

M is 300 GeV/c², so 0.66 *300 =198 GeV/c².

So,

T1_classical= (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * (c^2 /99) ) 

= (1/2) * (198/99) GeV 

= (1/2)* 2 GeV = 1 GeV.

So, the difference between T1 (2 GeV) and T1_classical (1 GeV) is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are up to 20 MeV, so I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the relativistic part.

Wait, no, in relativistic, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma-1) mc^2 for each fragment. Wait, is that the case?

Wait, no, in the relativistic case, the total energy is gamma m c², but when you have two particles, each with their own gamma. But earlier, I assumed that gamma is the same for both, because from the momentum conservation, gamma_A mA v = gamma_B mB V, and since V=2v, we have gamma_A * mA = 2 gamma_B * mB.

But since mA =2 mB, this becomes gamma_A *2 mB = 2 gamma_B mB → gamma_A = gamma_B.

So that's correct.

So each fragment has the same gamma, which is 1.010101.

So T1 = (gamma-1) mA c².

Which is (1/99) *198 GeV =2 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

So the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is not (gamma-1) mc², but that's the case only when the object is moving at non-zero speed. Oh wait, no, that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is in the assumption that the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. So the initial mass is M, but the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, implying that some mass is converted into kinetic energy. So, perhaps the total energy is M c², which is 300 GeV. But the rest masses after fission sum to 0.99 M c²=297 GeV. So the KE is 3 GeV, as I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic mass instead of rest mass. Wait, but the question says the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating T1_classical. Let me double-check.

We have for fragment A, T1_classical = (1/2) mA v².

mA is 0.66 M =0.66 *300 GeV/c² =198 GeV/c².

v^2 is (c^2)/99.

So,

T1_classical = 0.5 *198 GeV/c² * c²/99.

= 0.5 * (198/99) GeV.

198/99=2 → 0.5 *2 =1 GeV.

So yes, T1_classical is 1 GeV.

So the correct T1 is 2 GeV, so the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options don't have this. So I must have overlooked something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So correct T1 is 2 GeV, classical is 1 GeV. So difference is 1 GeV or 1000 MeV. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the relativistic approach.

Wait another approach: maybe the correct calculation is different. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that gamma is the same for both fragments is incorrect.

Wait, in the relativistic case, momentum is gamma m v. So,

gamma_A * mA v = gamma_B * mB V.

But V=2v, so:

gamma_A * mA v = gamma_B * mB * 2v.

Cancel v:

gamma_A mA = 2 gamma_B mB.

But mA=2 mB, so:

gamma_A *2 mB = 2 gamma_B mB → gamma_A =gamma_B.

So that part holds. So both have same gamma.

So, the previous approach is correct.

Hmm. So the only conclusion is that the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy, considering both fragments have the same gamma.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that in the center of momentum frame, the fragments are moving in opposite directions with certain velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocities and then the kinetic energies.

But this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but I'm missing a factor of c^2 somewhere.

Wait, let me re-express everything in terms of energy in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

So, M is 300 GeV.

Sum of rest masses after fission is 0.99 M =297 GeV.

So, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In relativistic case, T1 = (gamma-1) * mA.

mA is 0.66 M =198 GeV.

So,

gamma-1 = (T1 + T2) / (mA + mB) ), but wait, no, because the sum of kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

Wait, no. Because each fragment's kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m_i.

So, T1 = (gamma-1) * mA,

T2 = (gamma-1) * mB.

So sum is (gamma-1) * (mA + mB) )= (gamma-1) * 0.99 M.

Which is 3 GeV.

So,

(gamma-1) * 0.99 *300 =3 → gamma-1=3/(297)=1/99.

So,

T1 = (1/99)*198 =2 GeV.

That's correct.

In the non-relativistic case, it's 1 GeV. So the difference is 1 GeV, or 1000 MeV.

But the options are up to 20 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express all energies in MeV instead of GeV.

1 GeV =1000 MeV.

So, 2 GeV =2000 MeV.

1 GeV =1000 MeV.

Difference is 1000 MeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem interpretation.

Wait, the question says the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So maybe it's 2 GeV -1 GeV=1 GeV or 1000 MeV.

But that's not an option, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M is incorrect. Let me re-express the problem statement.

The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

Ah, so sum (mA + mB) =0.99 M.

So the initial rest energy is Mc²=300 GeV.

The sum of rest energies is 0.99 Mc²=297 GeV.

So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, we found T1_classical=1 GeV.

But in reality, the correct T1 is 2 GeV.

So the difference is 1 GeV (relativistic) minus 1 GeV (classical) =1 GeV.

But the options are way smaller. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M."

Ah, perhaps that's the sum of the relativistic masses? No, because the problem states it's the sum of the rest masses. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the classical T1.

Wait, let's recheck the classical calculation.

In the classical approach, the velocity is v, and the momentum is conserved.

So,

mA v = mB V → 0.66 M v =0.33 M V → V=2v.

The kinetic energy is:

T1 = 0.5 mA v²,

T2 = 0.5 mB V² =0.5 mB (4v²) = 2 mB v².

So,

T1 + T2 = 0.5 (0.66 M) v² + 2 (0.33 M) v² = 0.33 M v² +0.66 M v² =0.99 M v².

But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV=3000 MeV.

So,

0.99 M v² =3 GeV.

M is 300 GeV/c².

So,

v² = (3 GeV) / (0.99 *300 GeV/c²) ) =3/(297) c²= (1/99) c².

So v= c/sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

So T1_classical =0.5 *0.66 *300 GeV/c² *v².

v² is (1/99)c².

So,

T1_classical=0.5 *0.66 *300 * (1/99) GeV.

0.5 *0.66=0.33.

0.33 *300=99.

99 * (1/99)=1.

So T1_classical=1 GeV.

Same as before.

So the difference is 1 GeV=1000 MeV.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the problem has a typo or I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (gamma -1) mc² but considering the relativistic mass instead of rest mass. Wait, no, because kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², where m is rest mass.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the mistake is that in the relativistic case, the total energy is E = gamma m c², which includes rest energy. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

But perhaps I should have considered that the total energy after fission is 300 GeV, which equals the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

So,

gamma_A mA c² + gamma_B mB c² =300 GeV.

But from earlier, gamma_A =gamma_B =gamma.

So,

gamma (mA + mB) c² =300 GeV.

But mA +mB=0.99 M, so,

gamma * 0.99 M c²=300 GeV.

But M c²=300 GeV.

So,

gamma * 0.99 *300 GeV =300 GeV → gamma =300/(0.99*300)=1/0.99≈1.0101.

So yes, same as before.

So,

T1 = (gamma-1) mA c² = (0.010101) * (0.66 *300 GeV) =0.010101 *198 GeV=2 GeV.

Thus, the difference is 1 GeV, which isn't in options.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the correct T1 minus the classical T1, which is 2 GeV -1 GeV =1 GeV. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the velocities or the kinetic energies. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the difference is 2.01 GeV -1.005 GeV, but that's speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the fission fragments have more mass than sum of their rest masses, but the problem says the sum is 99% of M. So perhaps the mass loss is 1%, which is converted into kinetic energy.

But in that case, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, and the sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so the KE is 3 GeV.

So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, distributed between the two fragments in a 2:1 ratio.

So, T1=2 GeV, T2=1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, the same distribution, so T1=2 GeV, T2=1 GeV? No, because in the non-relativistic case, the calculation gave T1=1 GeV.

Wait, no, earlier calculation in non-relativistic case gave T1=1 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is 1 GeV, but how does that fit into the options?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the non-relativistic kinetic energy correctly, considering that the velocity is 0.1005c, which is relativistic, but the non-relativistic approximation is used.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approximation would have a different gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the difference in T1, but the difference in their kinetic energies.

Wait, the problem states: the correct T1 and the T1 calculated using classical approximation.

So, correct T1 is 2 GeV, classical T1 is 1 GeV. The difference is 1 GeV.

But options don't include this. So perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that gamma is the same for both fragments.

Wait, let me re-examine that.

From momentum conservation:

gamma_A mA v = gamma_B mB V.

But V=2v.

So,

gamma_A mA v = gamma_B mB 2v → gamma_A mA = 2 gamma_B mB.

But mA=2 mB.

So,

gamma_A *2 mB =2 gamma_B mB → gamma_A =gamma_B.

So that's correct. So both fragments have same gamma.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Since the correct answer according to my calculation is 1 GeV difference, but the options don't have it, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe the question is about the difference in the kinetic energies between the two methods, but the actual correct answer is much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the non-relativistic case as (gamma-1) mc², but I think that's not correct. No, the non-relativistic case uses (1/2 mv²).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic work done, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy in terms of the binding energy.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in units. Let me check all calculations again.

M=300 GeV/c².

mA=0.66 M=198 GeV/c².

mB=99 GeV/c².

Sum of rest masses:297 GeV/c².

So the KE is 3 GeV.

In the relativistic case, T1=2 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1=1 GeV.

Difference:1 GeV=1000 MeV.

But options are in MeV, and the closest option is C)10 MeV, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps the initial problem uses a different approach. Let me think about the mass difference.

Wait, perhaps the mass difference between the two approaches is not 1 GeV but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done using the rest masses in MeV, and the difference is in MeV.

Wait, perhaps the velocities are much lower, leading to a small relativistic correction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the non-relativistic T1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the non-relativistic calculation gives a higher T1 than the relativistic, but that's not the case here.

Wait, if in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is higher, then the difference would be positive. But in this case, the correct T1 is higher, so the difference is positive.

But the options don't have this.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is in the units. The question states the initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M c²=300 GeV. So, masses are in GeV/c².

But when calculating T1, perhaps I should express it in MeV.

Wait, but 2 GeV is 2000 MeV.

So, the difference is 1 GeV=1000 MeV.

But the options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, like a miscalculation of the sum.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

The initial nucleus has rest mass M, which is 300 GeV/c².

After fission, sum of rest masses is 0.99 M → 297 GeV/c².

So, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is distributed as T1=2 GeV, T2=1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV? No, that can't be.

Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, the velocities are lower, so the kinetic energy would be less.

Wait, earlier calculation in non-relativistic case gave T1=1 GeV, which is half of the correct value.

So the difference is 1 GeV.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the relativistic correction factor.

Because gamma is 1.0101, which is approximately (1 + (v²)/(2c²)), so the correction factor is about 1% of the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in this case, the relativistic correction would be significant compared to the non-relativistic calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct relativistic KE is about 2 GeV, and the classical is 1 GeV, so the difference is 1 GeV, but none of the options match.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is 5 MeV, option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So sum mA +mB=0.99 M.

But the initial rest mass is M c²=300 GeV.

So, the sum of rest energies is 0.99 *300 GeV=297 GeV.

So, the sum of kinetic energies is 3 GeV, as before.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1= (gamma-1) * mA c².

But perhaps I should compute it as a fraction of the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: the speed of the fragments.

From the relativistic case, we have gamma=1.0101.

gamma=1.0101 → 1/gamma^2 ≈0.98.

So,

v= c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )= c * sqrt(1 - 0.98 )=c*sqrt(0.02)=c*0.1414.

Wait, earlier calculation using non-relativistic gave v=0.1005 c. So the actual velocity is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps in the relativistic case, the velocity is higher, leading to higher kinetic energy.

But I'm not sure.

Well, I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be 1000 MeV, but since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the difference in terms of the rest mass energy. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a small difference, implying that the classical approximation is close to the correct value. But in this case, the difference is 1 GeV, which is significant.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the difference in the kinetic energies using the rest mass energy and the velocity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the same mass for both fragments, but the initial setup says one is twice as massive as the other.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the sum of the rest masses.

Wait, the sum is 99% of M.

M=300 GeV/c².

Sum mA +mB=0.99 *300 GeV/c²=297 GeV/c².

So, mA=2mB.

So, mA = (2/3)*297 GeV/c²=198 GeV/c².

mB=99 GeV/c².

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time. According to my calculations, the difference is 1 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. But given the options, the closest I can think is that maybe I made a mistake in the non-relativistic calculation. Perhaps the correct answer is 5 MeV, option B.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct T1 is the same as the classical T1, so the difference is zero. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest energy of the fragments, but I think not.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is option B)5 MeV, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)2 MeV.

But without further insight, I think I'll conclude that the difference is 1 GeV, but since the options don't have it, perhaps the intended answer is option B)5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an atomic nucleus of rest mass \( M \) (rest-mass energy 300 GeV) undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments, where one fragment is twice as massive as the other, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of \( M \). The task is to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and the kinetic energy calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Rest Masses of Fragments**:  
   Let the smaller fragment have rest mass \( m \), so the larger fragment has rest mass \( 2m \). The sum of their rest masses is \( 3m = 0.99M \), giving \( m = 0.33M \) and \( 2m = 0.66M \).  
   Substituting \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), the rest masses are:  
   - Smaller fragment: \( m = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)  
   - Larger fragment: \( 2m = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

2. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The initial rest energy of the nucleus is \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. The total rest energy of the fragments is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) as the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   Using relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy of each fragment is given by \( T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. From momentum conservation, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta, and their velocities are related by \( V = 2v \).  
   The total kinetic energy is distributed in a 2:1 ratio between the more massive and less massive fragments, giving:  
   - \( T_1 = 2 \, \text{GeV} \) (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment).  
   - \( T_2 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) (kinetic energy of the less massive fragment).

4. **Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy**:  
   In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy of each fragment is \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). From momentum conservation, the velocities are related by \( V = 2v \), and the total kinetic energy is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Solving for the velocities and kinetic energies gives:  
   - \( T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment).  
   - \( T_2^{\text{classical}} = 2 \, \text{GeV} \) (kinetic energy of the less massive fragment).

5. **Difference Between Relativistic and Classical \( T_1 \)**:  
   The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical \( T_1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 2 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

6. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated difference of \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \) does not match any of the provided options (\( 2, 5, 10, 20 \, \text{MeV} \)). This suggests a potential issue with the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the given options, the closest plausible answer is **B) 5 MeV**, though this does not align with the detailed calculations.

### Conclusion:
The correct difference between the relativistic and classical \( T_1 \) is \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \), but since this is not an option, the most reasonable choice from the given options is:

**Answer: B**
