Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, the problem gives me measured phase shifts for different l values. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) * ... Wait, wait, maybe the exact expression is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l +1) [ sin δ_l ] e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Oh, but wait, in this problem, we're along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. So cosθ is 1, right?

But wait, when θ=0, the direction is along the beam, so for each l, P_l(1) is 1 when l=0, and 0 otherwise, because Legendre polynomials P_l(1)=1 for all l, but wait no, actually no. Wait, no, P_l(1)=1 for any l, because it's the value at the pole. But I think that in the sum, for each l, P_l(1) is 1. Hmm, but wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, for l=0, P_0(x)=1. For l=1, P_1(x)=x. So at x=1, it's 1. Similarly, P_2(1)=1/3*(5 - something) but wait, actually, all Legendre polynomials evaluated at x=1 equal 1. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So, if that's the case, when θ=0, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, but the scattering amplitude f(θ) has both real and imaginary parts. The question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, so θ=0.

The expression for f(θ=0) is f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, but wait, e^{i δ_l} can be written as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So, when we multiply each term, we can separate the real and imaginary parts. So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l. Because e^{i δ_l} is cos δ + i sin δ, so when multiplied by sin δ, which is the imaginary part of e^{i δ}, the product's imaginary part will have the sin^2 δ term.

Wait, let me think again. If I have a term (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}, and I want the imaginary part of the entire amplitude, that would be the sum over (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l, because e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So when you multiply sin δ by that, the imaginary part comes from the sin δ * i sin δ, which is i sin^2 δ. So the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l multiplied by 1/k, right?

Wait, but let me compute this step by step. Let's express each term as (2l+1) sin δ_l * [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l]. So each term is (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l + i (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l. So the real part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l, and the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So the imaginary part Im(f(0)) = [sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/k).

Now, k is the wave number, which is related to the wavelength and the momentum. The electrons are 50 MeV. So we need to compute k.

The energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy is much larger than the rest mass, but perhaps we can use relativistic formulas.

The momentum p is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2. Solving for p:

p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c.

But wait, E in this case is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Hmm, in particle physics, sometimes E is the kinetic energy. Wait, no, in this context, when they say 50 MeV electrons, it's the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, I think in scattering experiments, E is usually the kinetic energy, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, sometimes E includes the rest mass. Well, let me think. For high energies, the rest mass is negligible, but 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV). So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps it's the total energy. Let me make sure.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and rest mass energy. Since the electron is moving at high speed, E = K + m c². But for high K, E ≈ K. So perhaps it's better to compute it correctly.

Wait, let's proceed. Let me compute the momentum p.

In natural units where c=1, but let's be careful.

E = 50 MeV. The rest energy is 0.511 MeV.

So E² = (pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, let's compute in units where c is in m/s.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using natural units where c=1, but then convert to appropriate units.

In natural units, E (in MeV) equals 1000 eV, and c is approximately 3e8 m/s. But perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, using the formula p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / (ħ c) * ħ c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k, the wave number, which is k = p / ħ.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

So p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy of the electron is E = gamma m_e c². The momentum is p = gamma m_e v. So in terms of E, we can write:

p^2 c^2 = (E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2).

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, wait, let me re-derive it.

From energy-momentum relation:

E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)².

So, p = sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c.

So, p = sqrt( (50 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c.

But since 50 is much larger than 0.511, the (0.511)^2 is negligible compared to (50)^2. So we can approximate p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But perhaps to be accurate, let's compute it properly.

(50 MeV)² = 2500 (MeV)².

(0.511 MeV)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)².

So, E² - (m_e c^2)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)².

So, p = sqrt(2499.739) MeV / c ≈ approximately 49.99739 MeV/c.

But wait, sqrt(2500) is 50, so sqrt(2499.739) is approximately 49.997.

So, p ≈ 49.997 MeV/c.

But since ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV fm (since ħ is about 6.582 MeV·s, and c is speed of light, so ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm). Wait, let me verify: ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, perhaps better to compute k in fm^-1.

Wait, k is p / ħ. Let me compute it.

We have p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) * c.

Wait, no, the units are a bit tricky. Let me clarify.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. But when using cgs or other units, perhaps it's easier. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

Then, p = 50 MeV / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / (ħ).

But since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So, p is 50 MeV/c. So, p = (50 MeV) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = [ (50 MeV) / c ] / (ħ) = (50 MeV) / (c ħ) ) = 50 / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/fm) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) = 1 / (197.33 MeV·fm) = (1/197.33) fm^{-1} MeV^{-1}.

So, p = (50 MeV/c) → because c is in m/s, but when using with ħ c, which has units of MeV·fm, perhaps the units will cancel out correctly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. Since k = p / ħ.

But p is in MeV/c, because p = E / c when E >> m c².

So, p = 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) ) → Wait, that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = p / ħ = p (1/(ħ)).

But p = 50 MeV/c → so 50 MeV / c.

So, k = (50 MeV / c) * (1/ħ) → but 1/ħ is in s^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: k = p / ħ.

Since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then 1/ħ = c/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So, p is 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = [50 MeV/c ] * [ c/(197.33 MeV·fm) ) ] = 50/(197.33) fm^{-1}.

So, 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, 197.33 is about 200, so 50/200 is 0.25. So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, more accurately, 50 / 197.33 = approximately 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So, k ≈ 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, because the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by (1/k).

So, let's compute the sum for l=0 to l=4, since the phase shifts beyond l=4 are ignored.

So the sum is:

l=0: (2*0+1) sin²(90°) → 1 * (1)^2 = 1.

l=1: (2*1+1) sin²(67°) → 3 * (sin 67)^2.

l=2: 5 * (sin 55)^2.

l=3:7 * (sin 30)^2.

l=4:9 * (sin 13)^2.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Sin(67) is approximately 0.9205. Squared is about 0.847. 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2:5 * sin²(55). Sin(55) is about 0.8192. Squared is about 0.671. 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5 → 0.25. 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)≈0.22495. Square is ~0.0506. 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554.

Adding these up:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541.

3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896.

6.896 +1.75=8.646.

8.646 + 0.4554≈9.1014.

So sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ≈9.1014.

Then, Im(f(0)) = sum * (1/k) → 9.1014 / 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Calculate that: 9.1014 / 0.2535 ≈ let's see.

0.2535 * 36 = 9.126 → because 0.2535 * 30=7.605, plus 0.2535*6=1.521 → total 9.126. So 9.1014 is a bit less than 36.

So, 9.1014 / 0.2535 ≈ approximately 35.87.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.2535 times 35 is 8.8725. 0.2535*35.8=?

Let me compute 0.2535 *35.8.

35 * 0.2535 = 8.8725.

0.8 *0.2535=0.2028. So 8.8725 + 0.2028=9.0753.

That's very close to 9.1014. So 35.8 * 0.2535 = ~9.0753, which is just a little under 9.1014.

The difference is 9.1014 -9.0753=0.0261.

So, how much more than 35.8 is needed? Let x be the additional amount beyond 35.8.

0.2535 *x =0.0261 → x=0.0261/0.2535 ≈0.1029.

So the total is approximately 35.8 + 0.1029=35.9029.

So approximately 35.903.

Wait, but wait, that's in units of fm. Because 1/k is in fm, since k is in fm^-1.

Wait, earlier computation:

1/k ≈ 1/0.2535 ≈ 3.944 fm.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1/(0.2535 fm^-1) is 3.944 fm.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum * (1/k) → 9.1014 * 3.944 fm.

Wait, that's 9.1014 *3.944 ≈ let me compute that.

Compute 9 *3.944=35.496.

0.1014*3.944 ≈ 0.1014 *4=0.4056 → minus 0.1014*(0.056) → approx 0.4056 - 0.0057 ≈ 0.3999.

So total ≈35.496 +0.3999=35.896.

Wait, so approximately 35.896 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me check again. Maybe I messed up a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-calculate the sum.

Compute each term's contribution:

l=0: 1 * (sin 90)^2 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * (sin67)^2. Sin(67)=0.9205. Squared is 0.847. 3*0.847=2.541.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2. Sin55≈0.8192. Squared ≈0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(sin13)^2. Sin13≈0.22495. Squared ≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541.

3.541 +3.355=6.896.

6.896 +1.75=8.646.

8.646 +0.4554=9.1014.

So the sum is correct.

Wait, but when I calculated 1/k, I thought k was 0.2535 fm^-1, so 1/k is about 3.944 fm.

Wait, but wait, 1/0.2535 is approximately 3.944, yes. So 9.1014 *3.944 ≈ 35.896 fm.

Wait, but the options are 87163, 355, 177, 251.

Hmm. 35.896 is about 35.9 fm. The closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of k?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units for k. Because perhaps I made a mistake when computing k.

Alternative approach: compute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 → p^2 c^2 = E^2 - m_e^2 c^4.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but in units where c=1, but in reality:

Wait, let me compute p in units where c=1, and then express p in MeV/c.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) → but E and m are in the same units, say MeV.

So E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

Now, what's the wave number k?

k = p / ħ.

But ħ in units of MeV s is about 6.582×10^-25 MeV s.

But perhaps it's better to use the conversion where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so k = p/(ħ) = p c / (ħ c^2) )? Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, then ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → because p is in MeV/c, multiplying by c gives MeV.

So, substituting p=50 MeV/c:

k = (50 MeV/c * c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50 / 197.33 → approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So, yes, k is approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So 1/k is 3.944 fm.

So, the sum is 9.1014 → 9.1014 *3.944 ≈35.896 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds. So perhaps I missed a factor of something.

Wait, another possibility: the formula for Im(f) is (sum) * (1/k) * (1/(2m)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f is in terms of the differential cross-section, but I thought the problem was directly about f.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should recall that the scattering amplitude f is related to the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ = |f|^2. But in this case, the question is about the imaginary part of f, not the cross-section.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but that doesn't seem right. Because when I have e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, and I'm taking the imaginary part of the product with sin δ_l, which is what? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Wait, no, wait. Let's go back. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1) ( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l (cosθ) ) / k.

So, when θ=0, all P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Expressed as f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ].

So, the real part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, that's correct.

So, Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/k).

So, sum is ~9.1014, 1/k ~3.944 fm.

So Im(f)=9.1014 *3.944 ≈35.896 fm.

But the options are all in the hundreds or thousands. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k.

Wait, alternative approach: since p =50 MeV/c → and k =p / ħ.

But if ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, then ħ = 197.33 MeV fm /c.

So, k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm/c) ) → the c in denominator and numerator cancels.

So, k = 50 / 197.33 → approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

Yes. So 1/k is 3.944 fm.

Wait, but why is the result about 35 fm, but the options are much larger. Let me check the problem statement again.

Oh wait, the scattering is of electrons, which are spin-1/2 particles. But in the case of elastic scattering, the phase shifts are only non-zero for certain l values. But in this problem, the phase shifts are given up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I evaluated the sum. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not squared.

Wait, wait no, because the imaginary part comes from the product of sin δ_l and the imaginary part of e^{i δ_l}, which is sin δ_l. So, sin δ_l * sin δ_l.

Hmm, unless I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the sum as (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by (1/k) * something else. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of f is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l times [ sin δ_l ].

Wait, that's the same as the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by (1/k).

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then the imaginary part is this sum multiplied by (1/k) * something.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that the amplitude f has a factor of (1/k), but perhaps in some texts, the amplitude is written as (1/(2m)) or something else.

Wait, perhaps the expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ).

So, the imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Yes, correct.

So with k =0.2535 fm^{-1}, Im(f)= sum * (1/k) → sum is about 9.1014, so 9.1014 /0.2535 ≈35.896 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. The closest is option B (355.351 fm), which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Because 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So perhaps I should compute E as the total energy, which would be K + m c².

So, E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV =50.511 MeV.

So, recalculate p.

p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → but in units where c=1, p = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 50^2 + 2*50*0.511 + 0.511^2 - 0.511^2 ) → sqrt(50^2 + 2*50*0.511) → which is sqrt(2500 +51.1 ) = sqrt(2551.1) ≈50.508 MeV.

So, p≈50.508 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) → because ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = (50.508 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50.508 / 197.33 ≈0.256 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.907 fm.

Sum is 9.1014 → Im(f)=9.1014 *3.907 ≈35.55 fm.

Hmm, that's about 35.55 fm. Still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the sum is incorrect. Let me recompute each term.

Compute each term accurately.

Compute (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l for l=0 to 4.

l=0: (1) * sin^2 90° → 1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67°)=3 * (sin67)^2.

sin 67°= sin(1.169 radians)= approx 0.920504853.

So (0.9205)^2 = 0.84728.

3*0.84728=2.54185.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°).

sin55≈0.819152044, square is ~ 0.67102.

5*0.67102=3.3551.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13°).

sin13≈0.224951054, square≈0.05061.

9 * 0.05061=0.45549.

Summing up:

1 +2.54185=3.54185.

3.54185 +3.3551=6.89695.

6.89695 +1.75=8.64695.

8.64695 +0.45549=9.10244.

So sum is approximately9.10244.

Now, 1/k: if k =50.508 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm) → 50.508/197.33 ≈0.256 fm^-1.

So 1/k≈3.907 fm.

So Im(f)=9.10244 *3.907 ≈ let's compute 9 *3.907=35.163, 0.10244*3.907≈0.400, so total≈35.563 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 35.563 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin² δ_l.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the imaginary part is Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )= sin δ_l * Im(e^{i δ_l})= sin δ_l * sin δ_l = sin² δ_l.

Wait, no, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So, when you multiply by sin δ_l, you get sin δ_l * cos δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So the imaginary part is the second term, which is sin² δ_l.

Which is correct.

So why is the result not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f has a factor of (1/(2m)) in front, where m is the target mass. Wait, but in the formula I used, f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, looking up the formula: the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l (cosθ).

So that should be correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the small angle approximation, or perhaps I should consider relativistic factors. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Oh! That's a possibility. Because phase shifts are usually in radians in formulas.

Wait, the problem gives phase shifts in degrees. So I should convert them to radians before computing the sines.

Oh, that's a big mistake! I forgot to convert degrees to radians.

Ah, that's probably where the error is.

Let me recalculate each sin(δ_l) with δ_l in radians.

So, first, convert each δ_l from degrees to radians.

δ₀=90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ₁=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ₂=55° →55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

δ₃=30° → π/6 ≈0.523599 rad.

δ₄=13° →13 * π/180≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute sin² δ_l for each l.

l=0: sin(1.5708)=1 → sin²=1.

l=1: sin(1.16937)=0.920505 → square is 0.84728.

l=2: sin(0.95993)=0.81915 → square is 0.67102.

l=3: sin(0.523599)=0.5 → square is 0.25.

l=4: sin(0.226893)=approx 0.2255 → square is 0.05088.

Now, multiply each by (2l+1):

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.84728≈2.54185.

l=2:5 *0.67102≈3.3551.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.05088≈0.45792.

Sum all contributions:

1 +2.54185=3.54185.

3.54185 +3.3551=6.89695.

6.89695 +1.75=8.64695.

8.64695 +0.45792≈9.10487.

So sum is approximately9.1049.

Now, k is still 0.2535 fm^-1. So 1/k is approximately3.944 fm.

So Im(f)=9.1049 *3.944 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

Compute 9 *3.944=35.496.

0.1049 *3.944≈0.411.

Total ≈35.496 +0.411=35.907 fm.

Still about 35.9 fm, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm still missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k. Let me recheck.

Wait, the momentum p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm.

So, k = p / ħ → but since ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c.

So, substituting into k:

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm)/c ) ) → the c in denominator and numerator cancels.

So, k =50 /197.33 → ~0.2535 fm^-1.

So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the differential cross-section's imaginary part, but that's not what the question says. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by the wave number k, but that's not clear.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by (1/k), but that would be different.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l for each l.

l=0:1 * sin(90°) =1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

So sum=13.382.

Now, Im(f)=sum * (1/k) =13.382 *3.944≈52.73 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by 2, or perhaps the sum includes an extra factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by (1/k) times another factor.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Upon reviewing, I found that the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin \delta_l e^{i \delta_l} P_l(\cos \theta) / k.

So, the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l / k.

Which brings us back to the initial calculation of about 35.9 fm, which still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different convention for δ_l, like δ_l being the real part of the logarithm of the scattering matrix element. But that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are for each partial wave, and the total is the sum of each contribution. But perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l) (1 + cos δ_l )

Wait, that doesn't seem correct, but let's try:

For each l:

l=0: 1*(1 + 1)=2 → 1*2=2.

l=1:3*(0.9205 + 1)=3*(1.9205)=5.7615.

l=2:5*(0.8192+1)=5*(1.8192)=9.096.

l=3:7*(0.5+1)=7*1.5=10.5.

l=4:9*(0.22495 +1)=9*1.22495≈11.02455.

Sum: 2 +5.7615=7.7615; +9.096=16.8575; +10.5=27.3575; +11.02455=38.38205.

Then Im(f)=38.38205 * (1/k)=38.38205 *3.944≈151.3 fm.

Still not matching, but closer to option D (251.271 fm) but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 2. Let's see.

If the sum is 9.10244, and I multiply it by 2, I get 18.204. 18.204 *3.944≈72.0 fm.

No, still no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the square, then multiplied by something else. But earlier that didn't give the right answer either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the real part for the imaginary part, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/k)*something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the scattering amplitude is f = sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] P_l(cosθ) / (k (2m)).

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (1/(2m)) where m is the target mass. But in the problem, the target is a nucleus. Hmm, but the electrons are the projectiles. So the reduced mass would be involved, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, assuming that the target is much heavier than the electron, the reduced mass μ ≈ m_e.

So, the scattering amplitude would have an additional factor of (1/(2 m_e)).

Wait, let's see. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin \delta_l e^{i \delta_l} P_l(\cos \theta).

But if you're considering the Born approximation or something else, there might be a factor of 1/(2m) involved. So, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ)= (1/(2 m_e)) * (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{iδ_l} P_l(...).

If that's the case, then Im(f) would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2 m_e k).

But wait, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c².

We need to compute 1/(2 m_e k).

But 2 m_e k = 2 * (0.511 MeV/c²) * (0.2535 fm^{-1}).

But we need to make sure the units are compatible.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

But perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2 m_e c^2)) * (1/k).

Wait, but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 1/(2m_e c^2) times the sum.

But without knowing the exact formula, this is getting tricky.

Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k. Because when you compute k = p / ħ, and p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in J·s, perhaps the units are not converting correctly.

Wait, let me compute ħ in MeV·fm.

We know that ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But c is in m/s, and 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

Wait, but perhaps this is not necessary, since the units should cancel out. But perhaps I should compute k in the correct way.

Another approach: express k in terms of inverse femtometers.

Since k = p/(ħ).

p =50 MeV/c.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ) → the c's cancel.

So, k=50/(197.33) fm^{-1} → 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Which is what I had earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/k) * (2m_e c^2).

Now, let's compute this.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382 (from earlier calculation).

Then, Im(f)=13.382 * (1/0.2535) * (2 * 0.511 MeV).

Wait, but why would there be a 2 m_e factor? I'm not sure, but let me try.

Wait, (1/k) is 3.944 fm.

2 m_e c^2 = 2 * 0.511 MeV =1.022 MeV.

But how does this fit into the units?

Hmm, perhaps the factor is (1/(2 m_e c^2)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2 m_e c^2 k)).

Which would be 13.382 * (1/(2 *0.511 MeV *0.2535 fm^{-1})).

But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I should re-express the calculation.

Wait, given that the sum is about9.10244, and 1/k is about3.944 fm, the product is approximately 35.9 fm, which is much smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the actual formula uses a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude f is in terms of the Mandelstam variable t, and perhaps the imaginary part is related to the optical theorem, which states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is proportional to the total cross-section.

But the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is f(0), so perhaps that's not applicable.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to about 35.9 fm, but the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the unit conversion. For example, if I thought that 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, but perhaps I should have used angstroms or another unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check again.

Wait, another way to compute k: since the wavelength λ=2π/k.

In natural units, the Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_e = 2π ħ c / (m_e c^2)^2 )? Wait, perhaps better to compute the Debye wavelength or something else.

Alternatively, the electron's Compton wavelength is λ_e = ħ c/(m_e c^2) )= ħ/(m_e c).

But I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, to compute k, which is p/ħ. Since p=50 MeV/c, and ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, p c =50 MeV.

So, p=50 MeV/c.

So, k =p/ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, substituting:

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → (50)/(197.33) fm^-1 → approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So, correct.

Hmm. At this point, I think the correct answer according to the calculation is approximately35.9 fm, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the differential cross-section's imaginary part, which would be |f|^2, but that's real. Or perhaps it's about the imaginary part of the differential cross-section, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves relativistic factors that I'm not considering. For example, perhaps the energy E is much larger than m, so E≈pc. But I think I accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by something else. But without further information, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the calculations, I'll have to choose the closest option, but none seems to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger. But I can't see where I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum, leading to a factor of 10. Let me recheck the sum.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the phase shifts. For example, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, and I didn't convert them correctly. Wait, no, I did the conversion earlier, but perhaps I made an error in that.

Let me recheck the sin values for each phase shift in radians.

δ₀=90° =1.5708 rad. sin=1.

δ₁=67°=1.16937 rad. sin=0.920505.

δ₂=55°=0.95993 rad. sin=0.81915.

δ₃=30°=0.523599 rad. sin=0.5.

δ₄=13°=0.226893 rad. sin=0.22495.

So the calculations of sin δ are correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger than my calculated 35.5 fm.

But I can't justify that factor of 10. Maybe the sum should be 91, leading to 91 *3.944≈358 fm. But that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 91.00244 instead of 9.10244? Because 91.00244 *3.944≈358 fm, which is close to option B (355.351 fm). But why would the sum be 91? That would imply that each term is multiplied by 10, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be 9.10244 multiplied by 10, leading to 91.0244, which when multiplied by 3.944 gives around 358. So option B is 355.351, which is close.

But I don't see where the factor of 10 would come from. Perhaps a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of 10 degrees, but that's unlikely.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with the calculation I've done. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option B, but I can't see where.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiplied by (1/(2m_e c^2 k)).

But let me compute that.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382.

1/(2 m_e c^2 k) =1/(2 *0.511 MeV *0.2535 fm^{-1}).

But this seems to complicate the units beyond what I can handle.

In conclusion, after multiple calculations and unit checks, I think the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts and Conversion**: The given phase shifts are:
   - \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\).
   These are converted from degrees to radians:
   - \(\delta_0 = 1.5708 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_1 = 1.16937 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_2 = 0.95993 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_3 = 0.523599 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_4 = 0.226893 \, \text{rad}\).

2. **Compute \(\sin^2 \delta_l\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_0 = 1\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_1 = (0.9205)^2 \approx 0.8473\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_2 = (0.8192)^2 \approx 0.6710\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_3 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_4 = (0.22495)^2 \approx 0.0506\).

3. **Sum Contributions**:
   The contributions from each \(l\) are:
   - \(l = 0\): \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
   - \(l = 1\): \(3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419\),
   - \(l = 2\): \(5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.3551\),
   - \(l = 3\): \(7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
   - \(l = 4\): \(9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554\).

   Summing these gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1024.
   \]

4. **Wave Number \(k\)**:
   The wave number \(k\) is calculated using \(k = \frac{p}{\hbar}\), where \(p = \frac{E}{c}\) for high-energy electrons. Using \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\):
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2535 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

5. **Imaginary Part of \(f(0)\)**:
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx \frac{9.1024}{0.2535} \, \text{fm} \approx 35.9 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 35.9 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option **B (355.351 fm)** is approximately 10 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or the problem setup. Given the options, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, the problem gives me measured phase shifts for different l values. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) * ... Wait, wait, maybe the exact expression is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l +1) [ sin δ_l ] e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Oh, but wait, in this problem, we're along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. So cosθ is 1, right?

But wait, when θ=0, the direction is along the beam, so for each l, P_l(1) is 1 when l=0, and 0 otherwise, because Legendre polynomials P_l(1)=1 for all l, but wait no, actually no. Wait, no, P_l(1)=1 for any l, because it's the value at the pole. But I think that in the sum, for each l, P_l(1) is 1. Hmm, but wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, for l=0, P_0(x)=1. For l=1, P_1(x)=x. So at x=1, it's 1. Similarly, P_2(1)=1/3*(5 - something) but wait, actually, all Legendre polynomials evaluated at x=1 equal 1. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So, if that's the case, when θ=0, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, but the scattering amplitude f(θ) has both real and imaginary parts. The question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, so θ=0.

The expression for f(θ=0) is f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, but wait, e^{i δ_l} can be written as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So, when we multiply each term, we can separate the real and imaginary parts. So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l. Because e^{i δ_l} is cos δ + i sin δ, so when multiplied by sin δ, which is the imaginary part of e^{i δ}, the product's imaginary part will have the sin^2 δ term.

Wait, let me think again. If I have a term (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}, and I want the imaginary part of the entire amplitude, that would be the sum over (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l, because e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So when you multiply sin δ by that, the imaginary part comes from the sin δ * i sin δ, which is i sin^2 δ. So the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l multiplied by 1/k, right?

Wait, but let me compute this step by step. Let's express each term as (2l+1) sin δ_l * [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l]. So each term is (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l + i (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l. So the real part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l, and the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So the imaginary part Im(f(0)) = [sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/k).

Now, k is the wave number, which is related to the wavelength and the momentum. The electrons are 50 MeV. So we need to compute k.

The energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy is much larger than the rest mass, but perhaps we can use relativistic formulas.

The momentum p is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2. Solving for p:

p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c.

But wait, E in this case is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Hmm, in particle physics, sometimes E is the kinetic energy. Wait, no, in this context, when they say 50 MeV electrons, it's the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, I think in scattering experiments, E is usually the kinetic energy, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, sometimes E includes the rest mass. Well, let me think. For high energies, the rest mass is negligible, but 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV). So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps it's the total energy. Let me make sure.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and rest mass energy. Since the electron is moving at high speed, E = K + m c². But for high K, E ≈ K. So perhaps it's better to compute it correctly.

Wait, let's proceed. Let me compute the momentum p.

In natural units where c=1, but let's be careful.

E = 50 MeV. The rest energy is 0.511 MeV.

So E² = (pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, let's compute in units where c is in m/s.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using natural units where c=1, but then convert to appropriate units.

In natural units, E (in MeV) equals 1000 eV, and c is approximately 3e8 m/s. But perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, using the formula p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / (ħ c) * ħ c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k, the wave number, which is k = p / ħ.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

So p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy of the electron is E = gamma m_e c². The momentum is p = gamma m_e v. So in terms of E, we can write:

p^2 c^2 = (E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2).

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, wait, let me re-derive it.

From energy-momentum relation:

E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)².

So, p = sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c.

So, p = sqrt( (50 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c.

But since 50 is much larger than 0.511, the (0.511)^2 is negligible compared to (50)^2. So we can approximate p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But perhaps to be accurate, let's compute it properly.

(50 MeV)² = 2500 (MeV)².

(0.511 MeV)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)².

So, E² - (m_e c^2)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)².

So, p = sqrt(2499.739) MeV / c ≈ approximately 49.99739 MeV/c.

But wait, sqrt(2500) is 50, so sqrt(2499.739) is approximately 49.997.

So, p ≈ 49.997 MeV/c.

But since ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV fm (since ħ is about 6.582 MeV·s, and c is speed of light, so ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm). Wait, let me verify: ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, perhaps better to compute k in fm^-1.

Wait, k is p / ħ. Let me compute it.

We have p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) * c.

Wait, no, the units are a bit tricky. Let me clarify.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. But when using cgs or other units, perhaps it's easier. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

Then, p = 50 MeV / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / (ħ).

But since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So, p is 50 MeV/c. So, p = (50 MeV) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = [ (50 MeV) / c ] / (ħ) = (50 MeV) / (c ħ) ) = 50 / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/fm) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) = 1 / (197.33 MeV·fm) = (1/197.33) fm^{-1} MeV^{-1}.

So, p = (50 MeV/c) → because c is in m/s, but when using with ħ c, which has units of MeV·fm, perhaps the units will cancel out correctly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. Since k = p / ħ.

But p is in MeV/c, because p = E / c when E >> m c².

So, p = 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) ) → Wait, that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = p / ħ = p (1/(ħ)).

But p = 50 MeV/c → so 50 MeV / c.

So, k = (50 MeV / c) * (1/ħ) → but 1/ħ is in s^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: k = p / ħ.

Since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then 1/ħ = c/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So, p is 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = [50 MeV/c ] * [ c/(197.33 MeV·fm) ) ] = 50/(197.33) fm^{-1}.

So, 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, 197.33 is about 200, so 50/200 is 0.25. So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, more accurately, 50 / 197.33 = approximately 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So, k ≈ 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, because the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by (1/k).

So, let's compute the sum for l=0 to l=4, since the phase shifts beyond l=4 are ignored.

So the sum is:

l=0: (2*0+1) sin²(90°) → 1 * (1)^2 = 1.

l=1: (2*1+1) sin²(67°) → 3 * (sin 67)^2.

l=2: 5 * (sin 55)^2.

l=3:7 * (sin 30)^2.

l=4:9 * (sin 13)^2.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Sin(67) is approximately 0.9205. Squared is about 0.847. 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2:5 * sin²(55). Sin(55) is about 0.8192. Squared is about 0.671. 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5 → 0.25. 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)≈0.22495. Square is ~0.0506. 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554.

Adding these up:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541.

3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896.

6.896 +1.75=8.646.

8.646 + 0.4554≈9.1014.

So sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ≈9.1014.

Then, Im(f(0)) = sum * (1/k) → 9.1014 / 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Calculate that: 9.1014 / 0.2535 ≈ let's see.

0.2535 * 36 = 9.126 → because 0.2535 * 30=7.605, plus 0.2535*6=1.521 → total 9.126. So 9.1014 is a bit less than 36.

So, 9.1014 / 0.2535 ≈ approximately 35.87.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.2535 times 35 is 8.8725. 0.2535*35.8=?

Let me compute 0.2535 *35.8.

35 * 0.2535 = 8.8725.

0.8 *0.2535=0.2028. So 8.8725 + 0.2028=9.0753.

That's very close to 9.1014. So 35.8 * 0.2535 = ~9.0753, which is just a little under 9.1014.

The difference is 9.1014 -9.0753=0.0261.

So, how much more than 35.8 is needed? Let x be the additional amount beyond 35.8.

0.2535 *x =0.0261 → x=0.0261/0.2535 ≈0.1029.

So the total is approximately 35.8 + 0.1029=35.9029.

So approximately 35.903.

Wait, but wait, that's in units of fm. Because 1/k is in fm, since k is in fm^-1.

Wait, earlier computation:

1/k ≈ 1/0.2535 ≈ 3.944 fm.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1/(0.2535 fm^-1) is 3.944 fm.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum * (1/k) → 9.1014 * 3.944 fm.

Wait, that's 9.1014 *3.944 ≈ let me compute that.

Compute 9 *3.944=35.496.

0.1014*3.944 ≈ 0.1014 *4=0.4056 → minus 0.1014*(0.056) → approx 0.4056 - 0.0057 ≈ 0.3999.

So total ≈35.496 +0.3999=35.896.

Wait, so approximately 35.896 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me check again. Maybe I messed up a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-calculate the sum.

Compute each term's contribution:

l=0: 1 * (sin 90)^2 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * (sin67)^2. Sin(67)=0.9205. Squared is 0.847. 3*0.847=2.541.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2. Sin55≈0.8192. Squared ≈0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(sin13)^2. Sin13≈0.22495. Squared ≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541.

3.541 +3.355=6.896.

6.896 +1.75=8.646.

8.646 +0.4554=9.1014.

So the sum is correct.

Wait, but when I calculated 1/k, I thought k was 0.2535 fm^-1, so 1/k is about 3.944 fm.

Wait, but wait, 1/0.2535 is approximately 3.944, yes. So 9.1014 *3.944 ≈ 35.896 fm.

Wait, but the options are 87163, 355, 177, 251.

Hmm. 35.896 is about 35.9 fm. The closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of k?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units for k. Because perhaps I made a mistake when computing k.

Alternative approach: compute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 → p^2 c^2 = E^2 - m_e^2 c^4.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but in units where c=1, but in reality:

Wait, let me compute p in units where c=1, and then express p in MeV/c.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) → but E and m are in the same units, say MeV.

So E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

Now, what's the wave number k?

k = p / ħ.

But ħ in units of MeV s is about 6.582×10^-25 MeV s.

But perhaps it's better to use the conversion where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so k = p/(ħ) = p c / (ħ c^2) )? Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, then ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → because p is in MeV/c, multiplying by c gives MeV.

So, substituting p=50 MeV/c:

k = (50 MeV/c * c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50 / 197.33 → approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So, yes, k is approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So 1/k is 3.944 fm.

So, the sum is 9.1014 → 9.1014 *3.944 ≈35.896 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds. So perhaps I missed a factor of something.

Wait, another possibility: the formula for Im(f) is (sum) * (1/k) * (1/(2m)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f is in terms of the differential cross-section, but I thought the problem was directly about f.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should recall that the scattering amplitude f is related to the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ = |f|^2. But in this case, the question is about the imaginary part of f, not the cross-section.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but that doesn't seem right. Because when I have e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, and I'm taking the imaginary part of the product with sin δ_l, which is what? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Wait, no, wait. Let's go back. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1) ( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l (cosθ) ) / k.

So, when θ=0, all P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Expressed as f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ].

So, the real part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, that's correct.

So, Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * (1/k).

So, sum is ~9.1014, 1/k ~3.944 fm.

So Im(f)=9.1014 *3.944 ≈35.896 fm.

But the options are all in the hundreds or thousands. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k.

Wait, alternative approach: since p =50 MeV/c → and k =p / ħ.

But if ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, then ħ = 197.33 MeV fm /c.

So, k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm/c) ) → the c in denominator and numerator cancels.

So, k = 50 / 197.33 → approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

Yes. So 1/k is 3.944 fm.

Wait, but why is the result about 35 fm, but the options are much larger. Let me check the problem statement again.

Oh wait, the scattering is of electrons, which are spin-1/2 particles. But in the case of elastic scattering, the phase shifts are only non-zero for certain l values. But in this problem, the phase shifts are given up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I evaluated the sum. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not squared.

Wait, wait no, because the imaginary part comes from the product of sin δ_l and the imaginary part of e^{i δ_l}, which is sin δ_l. So, sin δ_l * sin δ_l.

Hmm, unless I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the sum as (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by (1/k) * something else. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of f is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l times [ sin δ_l ].

Wait, that's the same as the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by (1/k).

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then the imaginary part is this sum multiplied by (1/k) * something.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that the amplitude f has a factor of (1/k), but perhaps in some texts, the amplitude is written as (1/(2m)) or something else.

Wait, perhaps the expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ).

So, the imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Yes, correct.

So with k =0.2535 fm^{-1}, Im(f)= sum * (1/k) → sum is about 9.1014, so 9.1014 /0.2535 ≈35.896 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. The closest is option B (355.351 fm), which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Because 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So perhaps I should compute E as the total energy, which would be K + m c².

So, E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV =50.511 MeV.

So, recalculate p.

p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → but in units where c=1, p = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 50^2 + 2*50*0.511 + 0.511^2 - 0.511^2 ) → sqrt(50^2 + 2*50*0.511) → which is sqrt(2500 +51.1 ) = sqrt(2551.1) ≈50.508 MeV.

So, p≈50.508 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) → because ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = (50.508 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50.508 / 197.33 ≈0.256 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.907 fm.

Sum is 9.1014 → Im(f)=9.1014 *3.907 ≈35.55 fm.

Hmm, that's about 35.55 fm. Still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the sum is incorrect. Let me recompute each term.

Compute each term accurately.

Compute (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l for l=0 to 4.

l=0: (1) * sin^2 90° → 1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67°)=3 * (sin67)^2.

sin 67°= sin(1.169 radians)= approx 0.920504853.

So (0.9205)^2 = 0.84728.

3*0.84728=2.54185.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°).

sin55≈0.819152044, square is ~ 0.67102.

5*0.67102=3.3551.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13°).

sin13≈0.224951054, square≈0.05061.

9 * 0.05061=0.45549.

Summing up:

1 +2.54185=3.54185.

3.54185 +3.3551=6.89695.

6.89695 +1.75=8.64695.

8.64695 +0.45549=9.10244.

So sum is approximately9.10244.

Now, 1/k: if k =50.508 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm) → 50.508/197.33 ≈0.256 fm^-1.

So 1/k≈3.907 fm.

So Im(f)=9.10244 *3.907 ≈ let's compute 9 *3.907=35.163, 0.10244*3.907≈0.400, so total≈35.563 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 35.563 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin² δ_l.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the imaginary part is Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )= sin δ_l * Im(e^{i δ_l})= sin δ_l * sin δ_l = sin² δ_l.

Wait, no, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So, when you multiply by sin δ_l, you get sin δ_l * cos δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So the imaginary part is the second term, which is sin² δ_l.

Which is correct.

So why is the result not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f has a factor of (1/(2m)) in front, where m is the target mass. Wait, but in the formula I used, f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, looking up the formula: the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l (cosθ).

So that should be correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the small angle approximation, or perhaps I should consider relativistic factors. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Oh! That's a possibility. Because phase shifts are usually in radians in formulas.

Wait, the problem gives phase shifts in degrees. So I should convert them to radians before computing the sines.

Oh, that's a big mistake! I forgot to convert degrees to radians.

Ah, that's probably where the error is.

Let me recalculate each sin(δ_l) with δ_l in radians.

So, first, convert each δ_l from degrees to radians.

δ₀=90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ₁=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ₂=55° →55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

δ₃=30° → π/6 ≈0.523599 rad.

δ₄=13° →13 * π/180≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute sin² δ_l for each l.

l=0: sin(1.5708)=1 → sin²=1.

l=1: sin(1.16937)=0.920505 → square is 0.84728.

l=2: sin(0.95993)=0.81915 → square is 0.67102.

l=3: sin(0.523599)=0.5 → square is 0.25.

l=4: sin(0.226893)=approx 0.2255 → square is 0.05088.

Now, multiply each by (2l+1):

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.84728≈2.54185.

l=2:5 *0.67102≈3.3551.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.05088≈0.45792.

Sum all contributions:

1 +2.54185=3.54185.

3.54185 +3.3551=6.89695.

6.89695 +1.75=8.64695.

8.64695 +0.45792≈9.10487.

So sum is approximately9.1049.

Now, k is still 0.2535 fm^-1. So 1/k is approximately3.944 fm.

So Im(f)=9.1049 *3.944 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

Compute 9 *3.944=35.496.

0.1049 *3.944≈0.411.

Total ≈35.496 +0.411=35.907 fm.

Still about 35.9 fm, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm still missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k. Let me recheck.

Wait, the momentum p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm.

So, k = p / ħ → but since ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c.

So, substituting into k:

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm)/c ) ) → the c in denominator and numerator cancels.

So, k =50 /197.33 → ~0.2535 fm^-1.

So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the differential cross-section's imaginary part, but that's not what the question says. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by the wave number k, but that's not clear.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by (1/k), but that would be different.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l for each l.

l=0:1 * sin(90°) =1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

So sum=13.382.

Now, Im(f)=sum * (1/k) =13.382 *3.944≈52.73 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by 2, or perhaps the sum includes an extra factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by (1/k) times another factor.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Upon reviewing, I found that the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin \delta_l e^{i \delta_l} P_l(\cos \theta) / k.

So, the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l / k.

Which brings us back to the initial calculation of about 35.9 fm, which still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different convention for δ_l, like δ_l being the real part of the logarithm of the scattering matrix element. But that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are for each partial wave, and the total is the sum of each contribution. But perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l) (1 + cos δ_l )

Wait, that doesn't seem correct, but let's try:

For each l:

l=0: 1*(1 + 1)=2 → 1*2=2.

l=1:3*(0.9205 + 1)=3*(1.9205)=5.7615.

l=2:5*(0.8192+1)=5*(1.8192)=9.096.

l=3:7*(0.5+1)=7*1.5=10.5.

l=4:9*(0.22495 +1)=9*1.22495≈11.02455.

Sum: 2 +5.7615=7.7615; +9.096=16.8575; +10.5=27.3575; +11.02455=38.38205.

Then Im(f)=38.38205 * (1/k)=38.38205 *3.944≈151.3 fm.

Still not matching, but closer to option D (251.271 fm) but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 2. Let's see.

If the sum is 9.10244, and I multiply it by 2, I get 18.204. 18.204 *3.944≈72.0 fm.

No, still no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the square, then multiplied by something else. But earlier that didn't give the right answer either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the real part for the imaginary part, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/k)*something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the scattering amplitude is f = sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] P_l(cosθ) / (k (2m)).

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (1/(2m)) where m is the target mass. But in the problem, the target is a nucleus. Hmm, but the electrons are the projectiles. So the reduced mass would be involved, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, assuming that the target is much heavier than the electron, the reduced mass μ ≈ m_e.

So, the scattering amplitude would have an additional factor of (1/(2 m_e)).

Wait, let's see. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin \delta_l e^{i \delta_l} P_l(\cos \theta).

But if you're considering the Born approximation or something else, there might be a factor of 1/(2m) involved. So, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ)= (1/(2 m_e)) * (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{iδ_l} P_l(...).

If that's the case, then Im(f) would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2 m_e k).

But wait, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c².

We need to compute 1/(2 m_e k).

But 2 m_e k = 2 * (0.511 MeV/c²) * (0.2535 fm^{-1}).

But we need to make sure the units are compatible.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

But perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2 m_e c^2)) * (1/k).

Wait, but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 1/(2m_e c^2) times the sum.

But without knowing the exact formula, this is getting tricky.

Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k. Because when you compute k = p / ħ, and p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in J·s, perhaps the units are not converting correctly.

Wait, let me compute ħ in MeV·fm.

We know that ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But c is in m/s, and 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

Wait, but perhaps this is not necessary, since the units should cancel out. But perhaps I should compute k in the correct way.

Another approach: express k in terms of inverse femtometers.

Since k = p/(ħ).

p =50 MeV/c.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ) → the c's cancel.

So, k=50/(197.33) fm^{-1} → 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Which is what I had earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/k) * (2m_e c^2).

Now, let's compute this.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382 (from earlier calculation).

Then, Im(f)=13.382 * (1/0.2535) * (2 * 0.511 MeV).

Wait, but why would there be a 2 m_e factor? I'm not sure, but let me try.

Wait, (1/k) is 3.944 fm.

2 m_e c^2 = 2 * 0.511 MeV =1.022 MeV.

But how does this fit into the units?

Hmm, perhaps the factor is (1/(2 m_e c^2)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2 m_e c^2 k)).

Which would be 13.382 * (1/(2 *0.511 MeV *0.2535 fm^{-1})).

But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I should re-express the calculation.

Wait, given that the sum is about9.10244, and 1/k is about3.944 fm, the product is approximately 35.9 fm, which is much smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the actual formula uses a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude f is in terms of the Mandelstam variable t, and perhaps the imaginary part is related to the optical theorem, which states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is proportional to the total cross-section.

But the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is f(0), so perhaps that's not applicable.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to about 35.9 fm, but the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the unit conversion. For example, if I thought that 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, but perhaps I should have used angstroms or another unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check again.

Wait, another way to compute k: since the wavelength λ=2π/k.

In natural units, the Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_e = 2π ħ c / (m_e c^2)^2 )? Wait, perhaps better to compute the Debye wavelength or something else.

Alternatively, the electron's Compton wavelength is λ_e = ħ c/(m_e c^2) )= ħ/(m_e c).

But I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, to compute k, which is p/ħ. Since p=50 MeV/c, and ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, p c =50 MeV.

So, p=50 MeV/c.

So, k =p/ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, substituting:

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → (50)/(197.33) fm^-1 → approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So, correct.

Hmm. At this point, I think the correct answer according to the calculation is approximately35.9 fm, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the differential cross-section's imaginary part, which would be |f|^2, but that's real. Or perhaps it's about the imaginary part of the differential cross-section, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves relativistic factors that I'm not considering. For example, perhaps the energy E is much larger than m, so E≈pc. But I think I accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by something else. But without further information, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the calculations, I'll have to choose the closest option, but none seems to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger. But I can't see where I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum, leading to a factor of 10. Let me recheck the sum.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the phase shifts. For example, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, and I didn't convert them correctly. Wait, no, I did the conversion earlier, but perhaps I made an error in that.

Let me recheck the sin values for each phase shift in radians.

δ₀=90° =1.5708 rad. sin=1.

δ₁=67°=1.16937 rad. sin=0.920505.

δ₂=55°=0.95993 rad. sin=0.81915.

δ₃=30°=0.523599 rad. sin=0.5.

δ₄=13°=0.226893 rad. sin=0.22495.

So the calculations of sin δ are correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger than my calculated 35.5 fm.

But I can't justify that factor of 10. Maybe the sum should be 91, leading to 91 *3.944≈358 fm. But that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 91.00244 instead of 9.10244? Because 91.00244 *3.944≈358 fm, which is close to option B (355.351 fm). But why would the sum be 91? That would imply that each term is multiplied by 10, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be 9.10244 multiplied by 10, leading to 91.0244, which when multiplied by 3.944 gives around 358. So option B is 355.351, which is close.

But I don't see where the factor of 10 would come from. Perhaps a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of 10 degrees, but that's unlikely.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with the calculation I've done. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option B, but I can't see where.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiplied by (1/(2m_e c^2 k)).

But let me compute that.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382.

1/(2 m_e c^2 k) =1/(2 *0.511 MeV *0.2535 fm^{-1}).

But this seems to complicate the units beyond what I can handle.

In conclusion, after multiple calculations and unit checks, I think the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, but I'm not entirely confident.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts and Conversion**: The given phase shifts are:
   - \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\).
   These are converted from degrees to radians:
   - \(\delta_0 = 1.5708 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_1 = 1.16937 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_2 = 0.95993 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_3 = 0.523599 \, \text{rad}\), \(\delta_4 = 0.226893 \, \text{rad}\).

2. **Compute \(\sin^2 \delta_l\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_0 = 1\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_1 = (0.9205)^2 \approx 0.8473\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_2 = (0.8192)^2 \approx 0.6710\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_3 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\),
   - \(\sin^2 \delta_4 = (0.22495)^2 \approx 0.0506\).

3. **Sum Contributions**:
   The contributions from each \(l\) are:
   - \(l = 0\): \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
   - \(l = 1\): \(3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419\),
   - \(l = 2\): \(5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.3551\),
   - \(l = 3\): \(7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
   - \(l = 4\): \(9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554\).

   Summing these gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.3551 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 9.1024.
   \]

4. **Wave Number \(k\)**:
   The wave number \(k\) is calculated using \(k = \frac{p}{\hbar}\), where \(p = \frac{E}{c}\) for high-energy electrons. Using \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\):
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2535 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

5. **Imaginary Part of \(f(0)\)**:
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx \frac{9.1024}{0.2535} \, \text{fm} \approx 35.9 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 35.9 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option **B (355.351 fm)** is approximately 10 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or the problem setup. Given the options, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**
