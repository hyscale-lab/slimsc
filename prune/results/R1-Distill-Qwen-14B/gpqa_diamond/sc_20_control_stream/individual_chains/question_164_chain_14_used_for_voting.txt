Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

So there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, in system_1, the radial velocities (RV) of the two stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has amplitudes of 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Wait, how do I connect RV amplitudes to the masses? I remember that the radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, and the velocity semi-amplitude relates to the mass of the companion. Oh right, the formula involves the mass function, but since both stars are observed, maybe I can use Kepler's laws here.

In a binary star system, both stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of each star is inversely proportional to the other star's mass. So if one star is more massive, it will have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving slower.

But wait, each system's period is given. For system_1, the period is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year. But the problem is about the mass of each system. The mass of the system is M1 + M2 for system_1, and M3 + M4 for system_2.

Wait, let me think about the Kepler's third law in the context of binary stars. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars. But I don't have 'a' here, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes relate to each other based on the mass. The more massive star will have a lower velocity because it's orbiting the center of mass with a smaller radius, hence lower speed. So for system_1, star A has K1 =10, star B has K2=5. For system_2, K3=15, K4=10.

The mass function relates each star's velocity to the system's mass. But since both stars are observed, maybe we can find the masses in terms of their velocities.

Wait, the mass ratio. The mass ratio q is M2/M1, and the velocities are inversely proportional to the mass. So if K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 is the velocity of star 2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So 10/5 = 2 = M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass for system_1 would be M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K3=15, K4=10. So K3/K4 = 15/10 = 3/2 = M4/M3. So M4 = (3/2) M3. Total mass is M3 + M4 = M3 + (3/2) M3 = (5/2) M3.

But wait, the total mass of the system depends on both stars' masses. How can I relate this to the period?

Wait, I think the period is the same for both stars. Because they orbit each other, the period is the same for both. So the period P is given for each system.

Wait, the period of the binary system is the same for both stars. Because they orbit their common center of mass, so their orbital periods are the same. So system_1 has P=2 years, system_2 has P=1 year.

Now, applying Kepler's third law. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * (a1 + a2)^3, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit. But a1 + a2 is the separation (a) between the two stars.

But in terms of velocities and Kepler's law, maybe I can use the formula that relates the velocity amplitudes to the mass.

Wait, for a binary system, each star's velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this case, since both stars' velocities are measured, we can set up ratios.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the mass function. The mass function for each star is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

where q is the mass ratio (M2/M1). But wait, when you have both stars' velocities, you can find their masses relative to each other.

Alternatively, since for each system, the two stars' velocity amplitudes are known, and the period is known, maybe we can compute the mass function for each and then relate them.

Wait, but how do I get the total mass from the velocity amplitudes and the period?

Another approach: The velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So for system_1, the ratio of K1 to K2 is 2, which implies that M2 is twice M1 (since velocity is inversely proportional to mass). So M1 : M2 = 1 : 2. So total mass is 3 M1.

For system_2, K3/K4 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M4 = (3/2) M3. So their masses are in a 2:3 ratio. So total mass is 5 M3 / 2.

Now, using Kepler's third law, which says (M_total) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3.

But a is the separation between the stars. Alternatively, the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits. Since a1/a2 = M2/M1, because they orbit the common center of mass such that a1 M1 = a2 M2.

So a = a1 + a2 = ( M2/(M1) ) a1 + a1 = a1 (1 + M2/M1 ) = a1 (1 + 2 ), since in system_1 M2=2 M1. So a1= (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a. Hmm, maybe not the easiest path.

Wait, let's think about the velocity of each star. The velocity is v = 2π a / P, where a is the radius of their orbit around the center of mass.

So for system_1, let’s denote:

M1: mass of star 1,

M2: mass of star 2,

a1: orbital radius of star 1,

a2: orbital radius of star 2.

We know that M1 a1 = M2 a2, because they balance each other around the center of mass. So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a, where a is the separation between the stars (a1 + a2 = a).

The velocities are v1 = 2π a1 / P,

v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1.

Which is consistent with our previous finding that v1/v2 = 2.

So for system_1, K1 =10, K2=5 → M2=2 M1.

Similarly, system_2: K3=15, K4=10 → M4= (3/2) M3.

Now, using Kepler's third law for each system.

The formula is (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³) / (G P²). But since a is related to the velocities.

Wait, maybe we can express a in terms of the velocities and the period.

For system_1:

v1 = 2 π a1 / P1,

v2 = 2 π a2 / P1.

But a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a,

a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

So, v1 = 2 π (M2 a)/( (M1 + M2) P1 )

Similarly, v2 = 2 π (M1 a)/( (M1 + M2) P1 )

But from system_1: M2 = 2 M1. So M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

So v1 = 2 π (2 M1 a) / (3 M1 * P1 ) ) → v1 = (4 π a) / (3 P1 )

Similarly, v2 = (2 π a) / (3 P1 )

Which gives:

v1 = (4 π a) / (3 P1 )

So solving for a: a = (3 P1 v1)/(4 π )

Similarly, for system_2: let’s do the same.

M4 = 3/2 M3. So M3 + M4 = (5/2) M3.

v3 = 2 π (M4 a') / ( (M3 + M4) P2 )

v4 = 2 π (M3 a') / ( (M3 + M4) P2 )

Where a' is the separation for system_2, and P2=1 year.

M4 = 3/2 M3 → M3 + M4 = (5/2) M3.

So v3 = 2 π ( (3/2 M3) a' ) / ( (5/2 M3) * P2 )

Simplify: ( (3/2) M3 ) / (5/2 M3 ) ) = 3/5.

v3 = 2 π (3/5 a') / (P2 )

Similarly, v4 = (2 π (1/5 a') ) / (P2 )

So v3 = (6 π a')/(5 P2 )

v4 = (2 π a')/(5 P2 )

Now, let's relate the a and a' for each system using Kepler's third law.

The formula is: M_total = (4 π² a³) / (G P² )

So for system_1:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ )/( G P1² )

Similarly, system_2:

M3 + M4 = (4 π² (a')³ )/( G P2² )

We can take the ratio of these two to find the mass ratio.

But from earlier, we have expressions for a and a' in terms of the velocities and periods.

For system_1:

a = (3 P1 v1 )/(4 π )

For system_2:

a' = (5 P2 v3 )/(6 π )

Wait, let me recheck that.

Wait, earlier I had:

v1 = (4 π a )/(3 P1 )

→ a = (3 P1 v1 )/(4 π )

Similarly, for system_2:

v3 = (6 π a')/(5 P2 )

→ a' = (5 P2 v3 )/(6 π )

So now, substituting a and a' into the mass formula.

For system_1:

M_system1 = (4 π² a³ )/( G P1² )

= (4 π² )/( G P1² ) * [ (3 P1 v1 )/(4 π ) ]³

= (4 π² )/( G P1² ) * (27 P1³ v1³ )/(64 π³ )

Simplify:

= (4 π² * 27 P1³ v1³ ) / ( G P1² * 64 π³ )

= (108 π² P1 v1³ ) / (64 G π³ )

Simplify more: 108 /64 = 27/16.

= (27 P1 v1³ ) / ( 16 G π )

Similarly, for system_2:

M_system2 = (4 π² (a')³ )/( G P2² )

= (4 π² )/( G P2² ) * [ (5 P2 v3 )/(6 π ) ]³

= (4 π² )/( G P2² ) * (125 P2³ v3³ )/(216 π³ )

= (4 π² * 125 P2³ v3³ ) / ( G P2² * 216 π³ )

= (500 π² P2 v3³ ) / (216 G π³ )

Simplify:

500/216 = 125/54.

= (125 P2 v3³ ) / (54 G π )

Now, let's take the ratio of M_system1 to M_system2.

Ratio = [ (27 P1 v1³ ) / (16 G π ) ] / [ (125 P2 v3³ ) / (54 G π ) ]

Simplify:

Ratio = (27 P1 v1³ /16 ) * (54 ) / (125 P2 v3³ )

= (27 * 54 )/(16 * 125 ) * (P1 / P2 ) * (v1³ / v3³ )

Calculating 27*54 = 1458, 16*125=2000.

So 1458 /2000 = 0.729.

P1 is 2 years, P2 is 1 year. So P1/P2 = 2.

v1 is 10 km/s, v3 is 15 km/s.

v1³ = 1000, v3³ = 3375.

So (v1/v3)^3 = (10/15)^3 = (2/3)^3 = 8/27.

Putting it all together:

0.729 * 2 * (8/27 ) ?

Wait wait, let me make sure:

Ratio = (27 *54)/(16*125) * (P1/P2) * (v1^3 / v3^3 )

= (1458 / 2000) * (2/1) * (1000 / 3375 )

Wait, 1000/3375 equals 8/27 ≈ 0.296.

So let's compute each part:

1458 /2000 = 0.729.

Multiply by 2 → 1.458.

Multiply by (1000 /3375): 1.458 * (1000/3375) = 1.458 * 0.296296... ≈ 0.431.

So the ratio is approximately 0.431. So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. Wait wait wait, no. Wait, the ratio is M1 / M2 = 0.43. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43. But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Oh wait, the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So if system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than 1. But looking at the options:

Options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, 0.43 is close to option A) ~0.4. But let me double-check the calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ratio calculation. Let me recompute.

Compute each part:

Numerator terms:

27 * 54 = 1458,

Denominator: 16 * 125 = 2000.

So 1458/2000 = 0.729.

P1/P2 = 2/1 → 2.

v1^3 =10^3=1000,

v3^3=15^3=3375.

So v1^3 / v3^3 = 1000 / 3375 = 8/27 ≈0.2963.

So multiplying all together:

0.729 * 2 * 0.2963 = ?

0.729 * 2 = 1.458.

1.458 * 0.2963 → Let's compute:

1.458 * 0.3 = 0.4374.

But since 0.2963 is about 0.296, which is 0.3 minus 0.0037.

So 1.458 * 0.296 = 1.458 * (0.3 - 0.004) = 0.4374 - (1.458 * 0.004)= 0.4374 - 0.005832= 0.431568.

So approximately 0.4316.

So the ratio M1 / M2 ≈ 0.43. So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2, and the factor is ~0.43. The options are A)~0.4, B)~0.6, C)~1.2, D)~0.7.

So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than 0.43 is to 0.6 or 0.7. So the answer would be option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh wait, if it's 0.43, then system_1 is 43% as massive as system_2. So it's less massive, so the factor is about 0.43. So the correct answer would be option A) ~0.4.

To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and stellar masses.

### Key Observations:
1. **System Parameters**:
   - **System_1**: Period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - **System_2**: Period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_3 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_4 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Mass Ratios**:
   - The radial velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. For system_1:
     \[
     \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_2}{M_1} \implies \frac{10}{5} = 2 \implies M_2 = 2M_1.
     \]
     Thus, the total mass of system_1 is:
     \[
     M_{\text{system_1}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 2M_1 = 3M_1.
     \]
   - For system_2:
     \[
     \frac{K_3}{K_4} = \frac{M_4}{M_3} \implies \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \implies M_4 = 1.5M_3.
     \]
     Thus, the total mass of system_2 is:
     \[
     M_{\text{system_2}} = M_3 + M_4 = M_3 + 1.5M_3 = 2.5M_3.
     \]

3. **Mass Ratio Between Systems**:
   Using Kepler's third law, the total mass of a binary system is proportional to \((a^3 P^{-2})\), where \(a\) is the separation between the stars. The separation \(a\) can be expressed in terms of the orbital velocities and periods:
   \[
   a \propto \frac{P \cdot K}{\pi}.
   \]
   Substituting the values for each system:
   - For system_1:
     \[
     a_1 \propto \frac{P_1 \cdot K_1}{\pi} = \frac{2 \cdot 10}{\pi}.
     \]
   - For system_2:
     \[
     a_2 \propto \frac{P_2 \cdot K_3}{\pi} = \frac{1 \cdot 15}{\pi}.
     \]
   The ratio of the separations is:
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2 \cdot 10}{1 \cdot 15} = \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}.
   \]
   Since the total mass is proportional to \(a^3\), the mass ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{system_1}}}{M_{\text{system_2}}} \propto \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{27} \approx 2.37.
   \]

4. **Final Mass Ratio**:
   Combining the above results, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.

### Conclusion:
System_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately **0.4**.
