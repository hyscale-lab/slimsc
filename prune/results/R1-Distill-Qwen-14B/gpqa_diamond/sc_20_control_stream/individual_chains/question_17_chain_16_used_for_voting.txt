Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions.

The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The given K value is 5x10^10. Wait, K usually stands for the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is. So, K for Ca-EDTA is 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

I think the formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but wait, the EDTA is in solution as its deprotonated form, which is Y^4-. So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Since the solution is at pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated, I can probably ignore any protonation issues. So the problem simplifies to that equation.

Given that, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, when the complex dissociates, it will release Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, the K is so large (5e10), which is a very big number. A large K means the reaction favors the product (the complex), so dissociation is minimal. So, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA will be very small.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per complex, the concentration of EDTA will also be x. So, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] will be approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x should be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, plug into the K expression:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So, 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) → approximately sqrt(2)*1e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414. Let's compute this.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 10^(-7) is 1e-7, and 10^(-0.5) is about 0.316. So, 3.16e-7 * 1.414 is about 4.47e-7? Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 4e-13? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, 5e10 is 5e10, so 2e-2 /5e10 is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. Because 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Oh wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, K is 5e10, yes. The initial concentration is 0.02 M. So, the calculation steps were correct. So, the free calcium concentration is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( x \). Then, the concentration of the complex is approximately \( 0.02 - x \), and since \( x \) is very small, \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \).

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( x \). Then, the concentration of the complex is approximately \( 0.02 - x \), and since \( x \) is very small, \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \).

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
