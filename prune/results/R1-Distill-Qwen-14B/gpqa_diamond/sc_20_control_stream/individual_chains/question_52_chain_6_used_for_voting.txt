Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The key part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is spotted. And we're told to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio observed is (n1)/(n2), and that ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), causing the ratio to decrease. Therefore, when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), the ratio should be higher.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the unspotted case has a higher ratio. So the factor is (higher)/(lower) = more than 1.

Let me think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The exponential term is exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2-E1 (assuming E2 > E1, which it probably is since higher energy level). So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger. So when T is higher (6000 K), the ratio is higher than when T is lower (5500 K). So the unspotted ratio is higher, as observed.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

Let me compute that. The ratio is ( (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1) )) / ( (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ). The g1/g2 terms cancel. So it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ).

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write it as:

(n1/n2)_1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )
(n1/n2)_2 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So the ratio (n1/n2)_1 / (n1/n2)_2 = exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ] )
= exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me compute the exponents. Let me take the exponent as [ - (ΔE)/(k T) ), so when I divide the two:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But since T1 is 6000 and T2 is 5500, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive. So the exponent is positive, and the exponential will be greater than 1. So the ratio (n1/n2)_1/(n1/n2)_2 is greater than 1, which aligns with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star is spotted, so the unspotted case is higher.

Now, I need to compute this exponent. Let's compute ΔE/(k). But the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms, or 1.448e-6 meters.

Wait, but the energy difference is given by the photon emitted during the transition. So the energy ΔE is equal to hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-6 m )

Let me compute that. Let's compute the denominator: 1.448e-6 m is 1.448 micrometers.

Compute hc/lambda: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-6.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-6 ≈ 1.372e-19 J.

Wait, but I can also compute it in terms of eV for convenience. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.372e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 0.856 eV.

Now, ΔE is about 0.856 eV.

But Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 0.856 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 0.856 / 8.617e-5 ≈ let's compute that.

0.856 divided by 0.00008617 ≈ 0.856 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 10,000 something? Wait, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

Wait, 1 / 0.00008617 ≈ 11,600. So 0.856 * 1e4 = 8560. But wait, 0.856 * (1/0.00008617) )= 0.856 * approx 11,600.

Wait, 0.856 * 11,600 = let's compute 0.856 * 10,000 = 8560, 0.856 * 1600= approx 1369.6. So total is 8560 + 1369.6 = around 9929.6.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 9929.6 K. Let me call it approximately 9930 K.

So now, our exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

So 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 K^-1.

1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^-1.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001513 K^-1.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) of 9930 K:

9930 * 0.00001513 ≈ Let's compute 9930 * 0.00001513.

First, 9930 * 0.00001 = 0.0993.

9930 * 0.00000513 = 0.0509649.

So total is approximately 0.0993 + 0.0509649 ≈ 0.1503.

So the exponent is approximately 0.1503.

So the factor is exp(0.1503) ≈ about e^0.15.

I remember that e^0.1 is about 1.105, e^0.2 is about 1.2214. 0.15 is between them. Let me compute it more accurately.

We can use a Taylor approximation or exact calculation.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

e^0.15 ≈ 1 + 0.15 + 0.15^2/2 + 0.15^3/6 + 0.15^4/24.

0.15^2=0.0225; 0.0225/2=0.01125.

0.15^3=0.003375; /6=0.0005625.

0.15^4=0.00050625; /24≈0.000021.

So summing up:

1 + 0.15 = 1.15.

+ 0.01125 → 1.16125.

+ 0.0005625 → 1.1618125.

+ 0.000021 → 1.1618335.

Next term: 0.15^5/120 = (0.0000759375)/120 ≈ 6.328e-7, which is negligible.

So e^0.15 ≈ ~1.1618.

Wait, but wait, I think a better approximation is that e^0.15 is about 1.1618.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can remember that ln(1.1618)=0.15. So yes, that's correct. So the factor is approximately 1.1618.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the unspotted ratio is higher, which makes sense because with higher T, the ratio is higher. So the factor is about 1.16. But looking at the options, the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, our calculation gives about a 1.16 times increase. So the factor is approximately 1.16, which is close to option A (~1.1). But wait, I might have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, compute ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, wait! No, wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Angstroms = 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

ΔE = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me redo that.

Wait, 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18. So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) ) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.372. So ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Now, converting to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.566 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, 1.372e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) = (1.372 / 0.1602) ) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) ) →  (8.56) * 10 = 85.6 eV? That can't be right. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1.372e-18 J is 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.372 / 1.602) ) * 10^( -18 +19 ) = (0.856) * 10^1 = 8.56 eV.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big number. Earlier, I thought it was about 0.856 eV. Oh wait, I see where I went wrong. I think I missed a decimal place.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I wrote λ as 1.448e-6 m, but that's incorrect. 1448 Angstroms is 1448e-10 m, which is 1.448e-7 m, not 1.448e-6 m. So I must have made a mistake in the denominator.

So redoing the calculation:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

Now, converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.372 / 0.1602 ) ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a much bigger ΔE than I thought earlier. So 8.56 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 → approximately 100,000?

Wait, 8.56 / 0.00008617 → let's compute that.

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So 8.56 / 8.617e-5 → 8.56 / 0.00008617 → let's compute that.

Well, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

So 8.56 / 0.00008617 = 8.56 * (1/0.00008617) = 8.56 * 11,600 approximately.

Wait, because 1/0.00008617 ≈ 11,600 (since 1/0.00008333 is about 12,000). Let me compute 1/0.00008617.

1/0.00008617 = 11,600 approximately.

So 8.56 * 11,600 ≈ 8 * 11,600 = 92,800, plus 0.56 * 11,600 ≈ 6,496. So total ≈ 99,296 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Now, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99300 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Compute 1/5500: approximately 0.000181818.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply by 99300: 99300 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute.

99300 * 0.00001 is 0.993.

99300 * 0.000005151 = 99300 * 5.151e-6.

Compute 99300 * 5.151e-6: 99300 * 5.151e-6 = (99300 / 1e6) *5.151 = 0.0993 *5.151 ≈ 0.5107.

So total exponent is approximately 0.993 + 0.5107 = 1.5037.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 99300 * 0.000015151 = 99300 * (1.5151e-5) ).

Which is 99300 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 1e5 is 100,000. So 1.5151e-5 is 0.000015151.

So 99300 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 100,000 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

But 99,300 is 0.993 * 100,000.

So 0.993 * 1.5151 ≈ 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

Thus, the factor is exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.503 is slightly higher.

Wait, I know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817. e^1.6 is about 4.953. So 1.503 is very close to 1.5, so e^1.503 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

e^1.503 → Let me think about it. e^1.5 is about 4.4817. The extra 0.003 is about 0.3% increase. e^0.003 ≈ 1.0030045. So 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ 4.497.

So approximately 4.497.

So the factor is about 4.5, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So option C is ~4.5, which matches our calculation. So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

Wait, but earlier when I made the mistake with the wavelength, I thought the factor was ~1.16. But after correcting, it's about 4.5. So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature $T_1 = 6000$ K) to having spots (effective temperature $T_2 = 5500$ K). The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of $\lambda = 1448$ Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are statistical weights, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]

2. **Energy Difference ($\Delta E$)**: The energy difference $\Delta E$ is calculated using the wavelength of the transition:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]
   where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s (Planck's constant), $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s (speed of light), and $\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1.448 \times 10^{-7}$ m. Substituting:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ J):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Boltzmann Constant ($k$)**: Boltzmann's constant is $k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}$ eV/K.

4. **Exponent Calculation**: The exponent in the factor is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right),
   \]
   where $T_1 = 6000$ K and $T_2 = 5500$ K. Compute:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   Next, compute the temperature term:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
   Multiply:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,300 \times 0.0000151 \approx 1.503.
   \]

5. **Final Factor**: The factor is:
   \[
   \exp(1.503) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not. This corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The key part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is spotted. And we're told to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio observed is (n1)/(n2), and that ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), causing the ratio to decrease. Therefore, when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), the ratio should be higher.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the unspotted case has a higher ratio. So the factor is (higher)/(lower) = more than 1.

Let me think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The exponential term is exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2-E1 (assuming E2 > E1, which it probably is since higher energy level). So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger. So when T is higher (6000 K), the ratio is higher than when T is lower (5500 K). So the unspotted ratio is higher, as observed.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

Let me compute that. The ratio is ( (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1) )) / ( (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ). The g1/g2 terms cancel. So it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ).

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write it as:

(n1/n2)_1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )
(n1/n2)_2 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So the ratio (n1/n2)_1 / (n1/n2)_2 = exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ] )
= exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me compute the exponents. Let me take the exponent as [ - (ΔE)/(k T) ), so when I divide the two:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But since T1 is 6000 and T2 is 5500, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive. So the exponent is positive, and the exponential will be greater than 1. So the ratio (n1/n2)_1/(n1/n2)_2 is greater than 1, which aligns with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star is spotted, so the unspotted case is higher.

Now, I need to compute this exponent. Let's compute ΔE/(k). But the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms, or 1.448e-6 meters.

Wait, but the energy difference is given by the photon emitted during the transition. So the energy ΔE is equal to hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-6 m )

Let me compute that. Let's compute the denominator: 1.448e-6 m is 1.448 micrometers.

Compute hc/lambda: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-6.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-6 ≈ 1.372e-19 J.

Wait, but I can also compute it in terms of eV for convenience. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.372e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 0.856 eV.

Now, ΔE is about 0.856 eV.

But Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 0.856 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 0.856 / 8.617e-5 ≈ let's compute that.

0.856 divided by 0.00008617 ≈ 0.856 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 10,000 something? Wait, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

Wait, 1 / 0.00008617 ≈ 11,600. So 0.856 * 1e4 = 8560. But wait, 0.856 * (1/0.00008617) )= 0.856 * approx 11,600.

Wait, 0.856 * 11,600 = let's compute 0.856 * 10,000 = 8560, 0.856 * 1600= approx 1369.6. So total is 8560 + 1369.6 = around 9929.6.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 9929.6 K. Let me call it approximately 9930 K.

So now, our exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

So 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 K^-1.

1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^-1.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001513 K^-1.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) of 9930 K:

9930 * 0.00001513 ≈ Let's compute 9930 * 0.00001513.

First, 9930 * 0.00001 = 0.0993.

9930 * 0.00000513 = 0.0509649.

So total is approximately 0.0993 + 0.0509649 ≈ 0.1503.

So the exponent is approximately 0.1503.

So the factor is exp(0.1503) ≈ about e^0.15.

I remember that e^0.1 is about 1.105, e^0.2 is about 1.2214. 0.15 is between them. Let me compute it more accurately.

We can use a Taylor approximation or exact calculation.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

e^0.15 ≈ 1 + 0.15 + 0.15^2/2 + 0.15^3/6 + 0.15^4/24.

0.15^2=0.0225; 0.0225/2=0.01125.

0.15^3=0.003375; /6=0.0005625.

0.15^4=0.00050625; /24≈0.000021.

So summing up:

1 + 0.15 = 1.15.

+ 0.01125 → 1.16125.

+ 0.0005625 → 1.1618125.

+ 0.000021 → 1.1618335.

Next term: 0.15^5/120 = (0.0000759375)/120 ≈ 6.328e-7, which is negligible.

So e^0.15 ≈ ~1.1618.

Wait, but wait, I think a better approximation is that e^0.15 is about 1.1618.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can remember that ln(1.1618)=0.15. So yes, that's correct. So the factor is approximately 1.1618.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the unspotted ratio is higher, which makes sense because with higher T, the ratio is higher. So the factor is about 1.16. But looking at the options, the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, our calculation gives about a 1.16 times increase. So the factor is approximately 1.16, which is close to option A (~1.1). But wait, I might have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, compute ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, wait! No, wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Angstroms = 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

ΔE = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me redo that.

Wait, 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18. So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) ) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.372. So ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Now, converting to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.566 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, 1.372e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) = (1.372 / 0.1602) ) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) ) →  (8.56) * 10 = 85.6 eV? That can't be right. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1.372e-18 J is 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.372 / 1.602) ) * 10^( -18 +19 ) = (0.856) * 10^1 = 8.56 eV.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big number. Earlier, I thought it was about 0.856 eV. Oh wait, I see where I went wrong. I think I missed a decimal place.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I wrote λ as 1.448e-6 m, but that's incorrect. 1448 Angstroms is 1448e-10 m, which is 1.448e-7 m, not 1.448e-6 m. So I must have made a mistake in the denominator.

So redoing the calculation:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

Now, converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.372 / 0.1602 ) ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a much bigger ΔE than I thought earlier. So 8.56 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 → approximately 100,000?

Wait, 8.56 / 0.00008617 → let's compute that.

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So 8.56 / 8.617e-5 → 8.56 / 0.00008617 → let's compute that.

Well, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

So 8.56 / 0.00008617 = 8.56 * (1/0.00008617) = 8.56 * 11,600 approximately.

Wait, because 1/0.00008617 ≈ 11,600 (since 1/0.00008333 is about 12,000). Let me compute 1/0.00008617.

1/0.00008617 = 11,600 approximately.

So 8.56 * 11,600 ≈ 8 * 11,600 = 92,800, plus 0.56 * 11,600 ≈ 6,496. So total ≈ 99,296 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Now, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99300 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Compute 1/5500: approximately 0.000181818.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply by 99300: 99300 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute.

99300 * 0.00001 is 0.993.

99300 * 0.000005151 = 99300 * 5.151e-6.

Compute 99300 * 5.151e-6: 99300 * 5.151e-6 = (99300 / 1e6) *5.151 = 0.0993 *5.151 ≈ 0.5107.

So total exponent is approximately 0.993 + 0.5107 = 1.5037.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 99300 * 0.000015151 = 99300 * (1.5151e-5) ).

Which is 99300 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 1e5 is 100,000. So 1.5151e-5 is 0.000015151.

So 99300 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 100,000 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

But 99,300 is 0.993 * 100,000.

So 0.993 * 1.5151 ≈ 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

Thus, the factor is exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.503 is slightly higher.

Wait, I know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817. e^1.6 is about 4.953. So 1.503 is very close to 1.5, so e^1.503 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

e^1.503 → Let me think about it. e^1.5 is about 4.4817. The extra 0.003 is about 0.3% increase. e^0.003 ≈ 1.0030045. So 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ 4.497.

So approximately 4.497.

So the factor is about 4.5, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So option C is ~4.5, which matches our calculation. So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

Wait, but earlier when I made the mistake with the wavelength, I thought the factor was ~1.16. But after correcting, it's about 4.5. So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature $T_1 = 6000$ K) to having spots (effective temperature $T_2 = 5500$ K). The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of $\lambda = 1448$ Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are statistical weights, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]

2. **Energy Difference ($\Delta E$)**: The energy difference $\Delta E$ is calculated using the wavelength of the transition:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]
   where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s (Planck's constant), $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s (speed of light), and $\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1.448 \times 10^{-7}$ m. Substituting:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ J):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Boltzmann Constant ($k$)**: Boltzmann's constant is $k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}$ eV/K.

4. **Exponent Calculation**: The exponent in the factor is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right),
   \]
   where $T_1 = 6000$ K and $T_2 = 5500$ K. Compute:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   Next, compute the temperature term:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
   Multiply:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,300 \times 0.0000151 \approx 1.503.
   \]

5. **Final Factor**: The factor is:
   \[
   \exp(1.503) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not. This corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
