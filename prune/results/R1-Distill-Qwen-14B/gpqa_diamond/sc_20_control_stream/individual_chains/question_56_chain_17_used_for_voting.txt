Okay, so I've got this question here about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So when an electron transitions, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, so n goes from 3 to 1. Since it's a two-step process via dipole transitions, the decay probably goes through an intermediate state.

Let me think about possible intermediates. From n=3, l=0, transitioning via a dipole would require l to go to l=1 because Δl=±1. So the first transition would go from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state would have l=1, and m can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, the initial m is 0. So the first transition could go to m=0, +1, or -1. So the possible intermediate states after the first transition would be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Then, from that intermediate state, another dipole transition would take it to n=1, l=0.

Wait, because from l=1, the next transition would have to go to l=0 (since 1-1=0). So the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. So for each intermediate state, let's check if it can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Let's take each option:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first, from l=0 to l=1, m remains 0. Then, from l=1 to l=0. But wait, when l=1, m is 0. So the second transition would need to have Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, the next m can be 0, +1, or -1. But the final state is m=0, so it's allowed. So this is a possible path.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first, from m=0 to m=1. Then, from m=1, the next transition can go to m=0, 1, or 2. But the final state has m=0. So that's allowed. So this is also a possible path.

Similarly, option C is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩. First, m goes from 0 to -1. Then, from m=-1, it can go to m=-2 (but l=0 would have m=0 only), so wait, no, the second state is |2,1,-1⟩. So for the second transition, the m must go from -1 to 0 (since the final m is 0). Δm = +1, which is allowed. So that's also a possible path.

Now, the question is about the probability of each transition. I think the transition probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements in the dipole approximation, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact expressions. But I remember that for each allowed transition, the probability is proportional to certain factors, like the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the square of the transition dipole moment.

Wait, in hydrogen, the transition probability from state |n', l', m'> to |n, l, m> is given by the square of the integral involving the spherical harmonics. So for the dipole transition, the integral is proportional to <n', l', m' | r · ε> |n, l, m>, where ε is the polarization vector. This can be broken down into components of the dipole operator.

The matrix element involves the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} and the dipole operator components. The dipole operator has components proportional to r Y_{1, m}, where m is -1, 0, +1. So when you take the product of Y_{l', m'} and Y_{1, m_dipole}, you can get terms that project onto Y_{l, m}.

The integral ∫ Y_{l',m'}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{l, m} dΩ is non-zero only if certain conditions are met, like the selection rules. But the actual value depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine how the angular momenta combine.

I think the probability amplitude for a transition from l' to l is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l' and 1 (the dipole) into l. So when you go from l_initial to l_final via l_dipole=1, the possible transitions are only when |l_initial - l_dipole| ≤ l_final ≤ l_initial + l_dipole. So from l=0 to l=1, that's allowed.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is l=0, n=3. The first transition is to l=1, n=2. Then from l=1, n=2 to l=0, n=1.

So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1, and the second is from l=1 to l=0.

Now, considering the m values, for each step, the change in m can be -1, 0, +1. So in each step, the m can change by up to ±1.

So, for each step, the transition can cause m to change by 0, ±1.

But the overall probability for each step is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So for each step, the allowed m transitions have certain probabilities.

Wait, but in the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩, the initial m is 0. So the dipole transition can cause m to change by 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m's for the intermediate state are 0, +1, -1. Each of these has a certain transition probability.

So for the first transition, what is the probability distribution of the m in the intermediate state?

The matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_1^k | 3,0,0>, where k is the component of the dipole (could be +1, 0, -1). Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selection rules for m.

Wait, the dipole operator components are proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}. So when you have an initial state Y_{0,0}, the matrix element for the transition to Y_{1, m} would involve integrating Y_{1, m}^* Y_{1, k} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, but integrating Y_{1, m}^* Y_{1, k} Y_{0,0} is the same as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining (1, m) and (1, k) to get (0,0). Because Y_{0,0} is the result of combining Y_{1,m} and Y_{1,k}.

Wait, no, the integral is zero unless m + k = 0. Because the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{l' m'} would be non-zero only if m' = m + k. Oh wait, but initial state is Y_{00}, so m' is 0. So for the integral to be non-zero, m + k = 0.

So k = -m. So when transitioning from Y_{0,0}, the only allowed m values are those where k = -m, because ∫ Y_{1 m}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{00} dΩ = something non-zero only when m + k = 0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When you have a transition from |n, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n', l=1, m'⟩, the transition is allowed if the integral of Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1, ±1, 0} Y_{00} is non-zero. Wait, maybe it's more precise to model the dipole operator as having components proportional to Y_{1 m}, where m = -1, 0, +1.

So the transition amplitude is proportional to the sum over these components. So for each possible m' in the intermediate state, the matrix element is a sum over k (the dipole component) of <2,1,m' | Y_{1,k} | 3,0,0>.

But the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}. So the matrix element is proportional to the sum over k of <2,1,m' | Y_{1,k} | 3,0,0>.

Wait, but Y_{1,k} for k=-1,0,+1. So let's calculate each term.

The integral <2,1,m' | Y_{1,k} | 3,0,0> is zero unless certain conditions are met. But wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1,k}, so the transition would involve integrating Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, k} Y_{0,0}.

But wait, Y_{0,0} is a constant, so the integral becomes Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, k} times Y_{0,0} integrated over all solid angles. Wait, but Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so integrating Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, k} * (1/sqrt(4π)) dΩ would be (1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * [ (sqrt(4π/(3)) ) δ_{m', -k} }, wait, no. The integral ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{0 0} dΩ is the same as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining (1, m') and (1, k) to get (0, 0), multiplied by some factors.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding two angular momenta j1 and j2 to get j and m. In this case, j1=1, j2=1, j=0, m=0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient CG(j1, m1; j2, m2 | j, m) is zero unless m1 + m2 = m. Here, m is 0, so m1 + m2 = 0.

So for our integral to be non-zero, m' + k = 0. So k = -m'.

And the value of CG is non-zero only when the sum of m's is zero, and the total angular momentum is 0. So the non-zero CG would be for when (1, m') and (1, -m') combine to give (0,0).

The CG coefficient for (1, m') and (1, -m') to produce (0,0) is sqrt( ( (1 - |m'| + |m'|) )/( ... wait, I think the CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=1, j=0, m=0 are known. Let me recall: the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 to get l=0. So for each possible m' and k=-m', the CG is sqrt( ( ( (j1 + j2 + j) ) ( ... )).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the integral ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{0 0} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient CG(1, m'; 1, k | 0,0). Which is non-zero only when m' + k = 0. And for j=0, the CG coefficients are known.

The CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=1, j=0:

For m1 = 1, m2 = -1: CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

For m1=0, m2=0: CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) = 1.

For m1=-1, m2=1: CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. I think the correct CG coefficients for adding two l=1 states to j=0 are:

The possible combinations are (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = 0. So possible pairs are (1, -1), (0, 0), (-1,1).

The CG coefficients for these are:

- For (m1=1, m2=-1): CG = 1/sqrt(2).

- For (m1=0, m2=0): CG = 1.

- For (m1=-1, m2=1): CG = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but when adding two l=1 states to get l=0, the CGs are given by:

CG(1, m1; 1, m2 | 0, 0) = 0 unless m1 + m2 = 0. When m1 + m2 =0, the CG is:

sqrt( (2 + 1)/( (1 + 1 + 1) ) ) ) * something? Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to remember that the CG coefficients for j=0 are:

For m=0, the possible combinations:

(1, -1): coefficient is 1/sqrt(2),

(0, 0): coefficient is 1,

(-1, 1): coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

But wait, perhaps the actual CG coefficients for j=0, m=0 are:

CG(1, m1; 1, m2 | 0,0) = √( ( (j1 + j2 - j) ( ... ) ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, considering that the possible ways to combine two l=1 vectors to get l=0 are by combining m=1 and m=-1, or m=0 and m=0, or m=-1 and m=1.

The states |1,1⟩ and |1,-1⟩ combine to form |0,0⟩, and their coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each. Similarly, |1,0⟩ combines with itself to form |0,0⟩ with coefficient 1. So the overall CG for |0,0⟩ in terms of the product states is:

|0,0⟩ = ( |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩ + |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ * 1.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The correct combination is:

|0,0⟩ = ( |1,1⟩⊗|1,-1⟩ + |1,-1⟩⊗|1,1⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + |1,0⟩⊗|1,0⟩ * 1.

Wait, no, actually, the CG coefficient for |1, m⟩ ⊗ |1, m'⟩ → |0,0⟩ is zero unless m + m' = 0. So for each pair where m + m' = 0, the CG coefficient is:

When m = +1 and m' = -1: CG = 1/sqrt(2),

m=0, m'=0: CG = 1,

m=-1, m'=+1: CG = 1/sqrt(2).

So, the integral ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{0 0} dΩ is proportional to CG(1, m'; 1, k | 0, 0). But since the initial state is Y_{00}, which is |00⟩, the integral would be non-zero only when m' + k =0, and the value is proportional to the CG coefficient.

So, for each possible m' in the intermediate state, the transition is allowed if m' + k =0 for some k. But in the dipole transition, the possible k values are -1, 0, +1. So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, ±1.

Wait, because from m=0, k can be 0, +1, or -1. So m' = m_initial + k = 0 + k. So possible m' are 0, +1, -1.

So the possible transitions after the first step are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.

But each transition has a different probability, which is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient.

So let's compute the transition probabilities for each m':

1. m'=0:

In this case, k=0 (because m' =0, so k=0). The CG coefficient is CG(1,0;1,0 | 0,0) = 1.

So the matrix element for this transition is proportional to 1.

2. m'=+1:

Here, k must be -1, because m' + k =0 → k = -1.

The CG coefficient is CG(1,1;1,-1 | 0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the matrix element is proportional to 1/sqrt(2).

3. m'=-1:

Here, k must be +1. The CG coefficient is CG(1,-1;1,1 | 0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the matrix element is proportional to 1/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities are proportional to (1)^2, (1/sqrt(2))^2, and (1/sqrt(2))^2.

Which gives probabilities of 1, 1/2, and 1/2 respectively.

But wait, the sum of the probabilities should be 1. Because from state |3,0,0⟩, the transitions to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩ are the only possible dipole transitions. So the total probability would be the sum of the squares.

Calculating the sum: 1 + (1/2) + (1/2) = 2. But that's not possible because probabilities must sum to 1.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability to each state is not just the square of the CG, but the square of the sum of CG coefficients multiplied by some factors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me think again.

The transition amplitude for a given m' is the sum over k of the product of the CG coefficients.

Wait, no. The transition amplitude is proportional to the integral of Y_{1 m'}^* (dipole component) Y_{00} dΩ.

But the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to Y_{1, ±1}, Y_{1,0}, etc.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator components are each proportional to Y_{1, m}, so the matrix element would be the sum over m_dipole of <2,1,m' | Y_{1, m_dipole} |3,0,0>.

Each term in the sum is non-zero only if m' + m_dipole =0.

Because m_dipole can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each m_dipole:

If m_dipole = -1 → m' = +1,

m_dipole = 0 → m' =0,

m_dipole = +1 → m' =-1.

So the three possible terms are non-zero only for these respective m' values.

The matrix element for each m' is:

For m'=0: dipole component m_dipole=0.

So <2,1,0 | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0> is proportional to CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) =1.

For m'=+1: dipole component m_dipole=-1.

So <2,1,+1 | Y_{1,-1} |3,0,0> is proportional to CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

For m'=-1: dipole component m_dipole=+1.

So <2,1,-1 | Y_{1,1} |3,0,0> is proportional to CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

Now, the transition probability for each m' is the square of the amplitude.

So:

- P(m'=0) = (1)^2 =1,

- P(m'=+1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2,

- P(m'=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

But wait, the sum is 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 =2, which can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Ah, I think I'm missing a normalization factor here. Because the dipole operator has three components, each contributing to a different m'.

The actual transition probability is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for each allowed m'.

But each amplitude is proportional to the CG coefficient, and the dipole operator might have an overall factor that includes a normalization.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator is proportional to sqrt( some factor ) multiplied by Y_{1 m}. So the overall amplitude for each transition would have a factor that includes this normalization.

Wait, the dipole operator is often written as e r Y_{1 m}, so the matrix element would be proportional to e times the integral of Y_{1 m}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1 l'}, where l' is the initial or final state. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe I should think in terms of the electric dipole selection rules and the associated transition probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the probability of each transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that transition.

So, for each possible m' in the intermediate state, the transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is proportional to (CG coefficient)^2.

Given that, for m'=0, the CG coefficient is 1, so the probability is 1.

For m'=+1, CG is 1/sqrt(2), so the probability is 1/2.

Similarly, for m'=-1, the probability is 1/2.

But this would imply that the sum of probabilities is 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2, which is impossible.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Maybe the actual probabilities are normalized such that the sum is 1. So perhaps each probability is (CG coefficient)^2 divided by the sum of all (CG coefficient)^2 for all allowed transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is not directly the square of the CG coefficient, but involves other factors like the overlap between the states and the dipole operator.

Wait, another approach: The total transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to any state |2,1,m'⟩ is 1, because it's a two-step process, but the first step must go to some |2,1,m'⟩ state, and then the second step takes it to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but the question is about the overall probability of the two-step decay path. So perhaps each possible intermediate state contributes a certain fraction to the total decay probability.

Hmm, perhaps each possible intermediate state has a certain transition probability, and the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each possible path.

So, considering all possible intermediate states, the decay can happen via three possible paths: to m'=0, m'=+1, m'=-1.

Each path has a certain probability, and the overall probability would be the sum of these.

Now, for each intermediate state, the second transition must also be considered. The second transition is from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, the transition is dipole, so Δl=1 (from l=1 to l=0), and Δm=0, ±1.

So for each m', what is the probability of transitioning to m=0?

Let me think about each case.

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩.

From m'=0, the next transition can have m change by 0, ±1. So, possible m's in the final state are 0, 1, -1.

But the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m=0.

So the transition from m'=0 must have Δm=0.

What is the probability of that transition?

Again, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,k} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, no. The second transition is from l=1 to l=0. So the dipole operator has components Y_{1, m_dipole}, and the transition is |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element is proportional to <1,0,0 | Y_{1, m_dipole} | 2,1,m'⟩.

Which is non-zero only if m' + m_dipole =0, because the final state has m=0.

So m_dipole = -m'.

So the allowed m_dipole are:

- If m'=0 → m_dipole=0,

- m'=+1 → m_dipole=-1,

- m'=-1 → m_dipole=+1.

The matrix element is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining (1, m') and (1, -m') to get (0,0).

So for each m', the CG coefficient is:

- m'=0: CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) =1,

- m'=+1: CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2),

- m'=-1: CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

So the amplitude for each case is proportional to the CG coefficient.

The probability is the square of the amplitude.

Therefore, for each intermediate state:

- If intermediate is |2,1,0⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has probability (1)^2 =1.

- If intermediate is |2,1,1⟩, the transition has probability (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

- If intermediate is |2,1,-1⟩, the transition has probability (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

Now, putting it all together.

Each first transition to |2,1,m'⟩ has a certain probability, and from there, each transition to |1,0,0⟩ has another probability.

So the total probability for each path is (probability of first transition) × (probability of second transition).

So:

Path 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

P1 = P_3→2_0 × P_2_0→1_0.

Earlier, the first transition P_3→2_0 is proportional to (1)^2=1. But wait, from earlier, I thought the probabilities sum to 2, which isn't possible. So perhaps I should normalize the first transition probabilities.

Wait, the first transition probabilities sum to 1, because the initial state must transition to one of the possible |2,1,m'⟩ states.

Wait, the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to any |2,1,m'⟩ is 100%, so the sum of all possible P_3→2_m' must be 1.

But earlier, the probabilities came out to 1 (for m'=0), 0.5 (m'=+1), 0.5 (m'=-1). Sum is 2, which is not possible.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Maybe the correct approach is that the first transition probability to each m' is (CG coefficient)^2 multiplied by some normalization.

Wait, perhaps the first transition probabilities are:

P(m'=0) = (1)^2 × (something),

P(m'=+1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 × (something),

P(m'=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 × (something).

But the sum of P(m') must be 1.

Wait, another approach: The sum of all possible transition probabilities from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is 1. So each m' has a certain probability, say P(m').

But for the first step, the probability for each m' is (CG coefficient)^2 multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to a different m_dipole. So the transition amplitude for each m' is the sum over m_dipole of the product of the CG coefficients.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again: the transition amplitude for a given m' is the sum over m_dipole of <2,1,m' | Y_{1, m_dipole} |3,0,0>.

Each term is proportional to the CG coefficient for that m_dipole.

But the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for all possible m' must be 1, since the initial state must transition to some state.

So, for the first step, the transition probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) for each m' are:

P(m'=0) = |a0|^2,

P(m'=+1) = |a+1|^2,

P(m'=-1) = |a-1|^2,

with a0, a+1, a-1 being the respective amplitudes.

Each a is given by:

a0 = CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) =1,

a+1 = CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2),

a-1 = CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities are:

P0 = (1)^2 =1,

P+1 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2,

P-1 = (1/sqrt(2))^2=1/2.

But sum =1 + 0.5 + 0.5=2. So this can't be right.

Ah! I think I see the mistake. The dipole operator has three components. So the matrix element for each m' is the sum over the three components, each contributing a term. So the transition amplitude for each m' is the sum over m_dipole of the product of the CG coefficient and the dipole component contribution.

Wait, perhaps each component of the dipole operator contributes equally. So the total amplitude is the sum over the three possible dipole components, each contributing a term proportional to their respective CG coefficients.

So, for the initial state |3,0,0⟩:

The amplitude for each m' is the sum over m_dipole of [ CG(1, m'; 1, m_dipole |0,0) × (dipole component) ].

Assuming each dipole component (Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}) contributes equally, their contributions would be summed.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator's components are all normalized the same, so the total amplitude for each m' is the sum of the CG coefficients for each m_dipole.

In that case:

a0 = sum over m_dipole of CG(1,0;1,m_dipole |0,0) × (Y_{1, m_dipole} component).

Wait, but how? It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the transition probability from |n, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n', l=1, m'⟩ is proportional to (2l+1) × delta_{m',0} + ... Wait, no, that's for electric quadrupole transitions, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: The transition probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the number of ways to reach that m' via the dipole components.

So, for m'=0: there's only one way (m_dipole=0),

for m'=+1: only one way (m_dipole=-1),

for m'=-1: only one way (m_dipole=+1).

Each of these processes has a certain weight. Since the dipole operator has three components, perhaps each contributes equally, so each has a weight of 1/3.

But that's not right because the CG coefficients for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=±1 it's 1/sqrt(2), as we saw earlier.

Wait, another approach: The transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that transition. So let's calculate the squares.

The CG coefficients are:

m'=0: 1,

m'=+1: 1/sqrt(2),

m'=-1: 1/sqrt(2).

So the squares are 1, 1/2, 1/2.

But these sum to 2, which is not possible. So perhaps I should normalize by dividing each by 2.

So the probabilities would be:

P(m'=0) = (1^2) / 2 = 1/2,

P(m'=+1) = (1/2)/2 = 1/4,

P(m'=-1) = (1/2)/2 =1/4.

Wait, sum is 1/2 +1/4 +1/4 =1. That makes sense.

So, the first transition probabilities are:

P(m'=0)=1/2,

P(m'=+1)=1/4,

P(m'=-1)=1/4.

Then, from each intermediate state, the probability to transition to |1,0,0⟩ is as calculated earlier.

So, for each path:

Path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Probability is P1 * P2.

P1 is 1/2.

From |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the transition probability is 1 (as earlier, because m'=0 requires m_dipole=0, and the CG is 1).

So P2 is 1.

So path A contributes (1/2) * 1 = 1/2.

Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

P1 is 1/4.

From |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the m_dipole must be -1, so the CG is 1/sqrt(2), so P2 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

So path B contributes (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.

Similarly, Path C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

P1=1/4,

P2=1/2,

So contribution is (1/4)*(1/2)=1/8.

So the total probability is sum of all path contributions.

Only possible paths are A, B, and C.

So total P = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2 + 2/8 = 1/2 + 1/4= 3/4.

Wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so perhaps the only two possible paths are A and D, but wait, looking back at the options, the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, the options are:

A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  with probability 1/3.

B) → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 1/4.

C) → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 1/4.

D) → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 2/3.

Wait, according to my calculation, the total probability is 3/4. But none of the options have 3/4. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the total probability of all possible paths, but about a specific route, which is only one of the possible paths. So the options are about which single two-step path is possible and what's its probability.

Wait, that's possible. So each option is a specific path and its probability. So, for example, option A is the path via |2,1,0⟩, and says the probability is 1/3.

But according to my earlier calculations, the probability for path A is 1/2, from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ (1/2), then → |1,0,0⟩ (1), so total 1/2.

But option A has 1/3. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition via each path as being a specific probability, not the sum of all paths.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the probability of a specific two-step decay, not the total probability. So if the decay goes via |2,1,0⟩, what is the probability of that particular path.

But the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So perhaps each option is suggesting a particular route, and its probability.

But according to the calculation for path A, the probability is 1/2. But option A says 1/3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probabilities for each possible path, and see which options match.

So, path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The first transition probability is 1/2.

The second transition probability is 1.

So overall, 1/2 *1 =1/2.

But option A says the probability is 1/3, which doesn't match.

Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

First transition: 1/4.

Second transition: 1/2.

Total: 1/4 * 1/2 =1/8.

Option B says probability is 1/4, which doesn't match.

Path C: same as B, probability is 1/8. Option C says 1/4, which doesn't match.

Path D: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Same as path A, but option D says probability is 2/3.

Hmm, none of the options match the calculated probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial probabilities.

Let me re-examine the first transition.

The initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to |2,1,m'⟩ for m'=0, ±1.

The transition probability to each m' is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient.

The CG coefficients are:

m'=0: CG=1,

m'=+1: CG=1/sqrt(2),

m'=-1: CG=1/sqrt(2).

But the sum of squares is 1 + 1/2 +1/2 =2, which is more than 1. So we must normalize the probabilities by dividing each by 2.

So,

P(m'=0) = (1)^2 / 2 =1/2,

P(m'=+1) = (1/2)/2 =1/4,

P(m'=-1)=1/4.

So, the first transition probabilities are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4.

Now, for each path, the second transition's probability is:

For path A (m'=0): the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is certain (prob 1).

So path A's total probability is 1/2 *1=1/2.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the total probability of all possible two-step paths, but about the probability of a specific two-step path, regardless of others.

But the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions, so perhaps all possible paths are considered, and their probabilities are summed.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the transition route and the corresponding probability are", which suggests that the correct option includes a specific route and its probability.

So, perhaps I'm supposed to find which of the options correctly describes a possible route and gives the correct probability for that route.

So in option A, the route is via |2,1,0⟩, and the probability is 1/3.

But according to my calculation, the probability for this route is 1/2.

So option A can't be correct.

Option B: route via |2,1,1⟩, probability 1/4.

According to calculation, the probability for this route is 1/4 * 1/2 =1/8.

Which doesn't match.

Option C: route via |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Probability is also 1/8, so option C isn't correct.

Option D: route via |2,1,0⟩, probability 2/3.

But according to calculation, it's 1/2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the second transition probabilities.

Wait, for the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that transition.

So, for example, for m'=0:

The CG coefficient is 1, so P =1.

For m'=+1: CG is 1/sqrt(2), so P=1/2.

For m'=-1: CG is 1/sqrt(2), so P=1/2.

So for each path:

A: 1/2 *1 =1/2,

B: 1/4 *1/2=1/8,

C:1/4 *1/2=1/8.

Total probability is 1/2 +1/8 +1/8= 3/4.

But the question is about a specific path, not the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the total probability but about the probability of each possible path, and which option correctly states a possible path with its specific probability.

Wait, but the options present only one route and its probability. So perhaps the correct answer is the option where the route is via |2,1,0⟩, with probability 1/3, but according to my calculation, it's 1/2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can only decay via certain allowed transitions. For example, perhaps certain m' are not allowed due to parity or other selection rules.

Wait, but the selection rule for dipole transitions is Δl=±1, which is met here.

Another thought: perhaps the transition probability is not just the product of the two step probabilities, but there's another factor involved, such as the overlap between the states.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of the transition probabilities for the different paths.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the possible first steps are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

The second step from each of these can reach |1,0,0⟩ with certain probabilities.

So the total probability for each path is the product of the first and second step probabilities.

So, for each path:

A: (1/2) *1=1/2,

B: (1/4)*(1/2)=1/8,

C: (1/4)*(1/2)=1/8,

D: same as A, but option D's probability is 2/3.

So the total probability is 1/2 +1/8 +1/8= 3/4.

But the question isn't about the total, but about a single path.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but according to calculations, it's 1/2. So why would option A say 1/3?

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules are such that only certain transitions are allowed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions actually has to go through certain intermediates that have the same parity.

Wait, the parity of the states is given by (-1)^l.

So |3,0,0⟩ has parity (-1)^0=1.

|2,1,0⟩ has parity (-1)^1=-1.

|1,0,0⟩ has parity 1.

So the transition from l=0 (parity +1) to l=1 (parity -1) is allowed for the first step. Then, from l=1 (-1) to l=0 (+1), which is allowed.

So that's fine.

But perhaps the correct option is only one of the possibilities, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is 2/3.

But according to my calculation, the probability for this path is 1/2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible initial and final states and the possible intermediates.

Wait, another approach: the transition from n=3 to n=1 in hydrogen can be achieved in a single dipole transition (Δn=±1), but since the question specifies two dipole transitions, it must go through an intermediate state.

So the possible intermediates are n=2, since 3 →2 →1.

So the only possible intermediate is n=2, l=1.

Therefore, the possible routes are the ones given in the options.

Now, the question is about the probability of each specific route.

So, perhaps the probability isn't just the product of the two step probabilities, but the square of a certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the probability is calculated as the square of the product of the two CG coefficients.

So for the route via |2,1,0⟩, the total probability is (1) * (1) =1, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the matrix elements for each two-step transition.

The overall transition amplitude is the product of the two step amplitudes.

So for path A:

Amplitude1: 1 (from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩),

Amplitude2: 1 (from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩),

so overall amplitude is 1 *1=1.

Similarly, for path B:

Amplitude1:1/sqrt(2),

Amplitude2:1/sqrt(2),

so amplitude is 1/2,

so probability is (1/2)^2=1/4.

Wait, no. Because each amplitude is a separate step, the overall amplitude is the product.

Wait, but each step's amplitude is the matrix element for that step.

So for path A:

A1 = <2,1,0 | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0> =1,

A2 = <1,0,0 | Y_{1,0} |2,1,0> =1,

so overall amplitude is 1*1=1.

But this can't be right, because the probabilities can't exceed 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall amplitude is the product of the two step amplitudes, and the probability is the square of the product.

But each step's amplitude is proportional to the CG coefficient.

So for path A:

A1 =1,

A2=1,

so overall amplitude =1 *1=1,

probability=1^2=1.

But the total probability from all paths must be 1.

But according to this, path A would have probability 1, which can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another thought: perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions is only allowed through certain intermediates, and each intermediate contributes a certain fraction.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the allowed transitions have to obey additional selection rules, such as the change in n being ±1 in each step.

Since n=3 →2 is allowed (Δn= -1), and 2→1 is allowed (Δn=-1), the steps are allowed.

Another consideration: the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/2, as calculated earlier. From there, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has probability 1.

So the total probability for this path is 1/2.

But none of the options have this.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the probability is 2/3, but our calculation says 1/2.

Wait, perhaps there's a factor of 2 somewhere I'm missing. For example, perhaps the dipole operator has a factor that includes a sqrt(2), and when squared, contributes a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall transition probability is given by the product of the probabilities of each step, but each step's probability is the square of the CG coefficient multiplied by a factor.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps the transition probabilities for each step are not 1/2, 1/4, 1/4, but different.

Wait, perhaps the initial transition probabilities are determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients divided by the number of possible m's.

Wait, for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, the possible m's are 0, ±1.

The CG coefficients are 1, 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2).

Squares are 1, 0.5, 0.5.

Sum is 2.

So probabilities are (1/2, 1/4, 1/4).

So the first step probabilities are correct.

Then, the second step from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

For m'=0: CG=1, P=1,

m'=+1: CG=1/sqrt(2), P=0.5,

m'=-1: CG=1/sqrt(2), P=0.5.

So path probabilities:

A: 1/2 *1 =1/2,

B:1/4 *0.5=1/8,

C:1/4 *0.5=1/8.

Total 1/2 +1/8 +1/8 = 3/4.

But the question is about the probability of the two-step transition, so the total probability would be 3/4.

But none of the options have 3/4.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) probability 1/3,

B) 1/4,

C)1/4,

D) 2/3.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm miscalculating the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is not allowed. But no, because Δl=1, and m=0 →m=0 is allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is forbidden for some reason.

But the selection rules allow it, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the transition is allowed only for certain combinations of angular momentum, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I should select it because the transition via |2,1,0⟩ is the only possible one.

But according to selection rules, the other transitions are allowed too.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible routes and their probabilities again.

Wait, maybe I should consider only the possible transitions where the total angular momentum is conserved.

Wait, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state and the intermediate state have the same parity, which is not the case.

|3,0,0⟩ has parity +1, |2,1,0⟩ has parity -1, |1,0,0⟩ has parity +1.

So the parity changes correctly in each step.

So it's allowed.

Another approach: perhaps the correct probability is 2/3, which is option D.

But according to my earlier calculation, the probability for path A is 1/2.

So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 2/3, as in option D.

But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities in terms of the number of available paths.

Wait, there are three possible intermediates, but perhaps only one of them leads to the final state.

Wait, no, all three intermediates can lead to the final state.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's the only option where the intermediate is l=1, m=0, which is a possible route.

But according to the probabilities, the path A has a higher probability than any other, but the options don't reflect that.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe the answer is option A, because the probability is 1/3.

But according to my earlier calculation, it's 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition via |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, perhaps the overall transition probability is given by the sum over all possible intermediates of (CG1 * CG2)^2, where CG1 is the first step CG and CG2 is the second step CG.

So for path A:

(1*1)^2=1.

But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the product of the two CG coefficients squared.

For path A: (1)^2 * (1)^2 =1.

But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A with a probability of 1/3 because there are three possible intermediates, each with equal probability.

But earlier calculation shows that the probabilities are not equal.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm not making progress and should make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct transition route is via |2,1,0⟩, as this is the only state where m remains 0, which might maximize the probability.

So the correct option is A, but according to my calculation, the probability is 1/2. However, since option A says 1/3, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which says the probability is 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But why 1/3?

Wait, perhaps the initial transition probabilities are each 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, but that doesn't align with the CG coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, and I should proceed with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis begins by recalling the selection rules for electric dipole transitions: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) can decay to |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0) through an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1). The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩, each with specific transition probabilities.

### Key Calculations:
1. **First Transition Probabilities**:
   - The transition probabilities from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
     - P(m'=0) = 1/2,
     - P(m'=+1) = 1/4,
     - P(m'=-1) = 1/4.
   - These probabilities sum to 1, ensuring normalization.

2. **Second Transition Probabilities**:
   - From each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the probability to transition to |1,0,0⟩ is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
     - From |2,1,0⟩: P = 1,
     - From |2,1,1⟩: P = 1/2,
     - From |2,1,-1⟩: P = 1/2.

3. **Total Probability for Each Path**:
   - Path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:
     - P = (1/2) * 1 = 1/2.
   - Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:
     - P = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.
   - Path C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:
     - P = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.
   - Total probability = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/4.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3. However, the calculated probability for this path is 1/2, not 1/3. This option is inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option B**: States that the transition is via |2,1,1⟩ with a probability of 1/4. The calculated probability for this path is 1/8, not 1/4. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: States that the transition is via |2,1,-1⟩ with a probability of 1/4. The calculated probability for this path is 1/8, not 1/4. This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: States that the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with a probability of 2/3. The calculated probability for this path is 1/2, not 2/3. This option is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is via |2,1,0⟩, as this is the most probable path. However, none of the options correctly match the calculated probabilities. Based on the given options, **Option A** is the closest match, despite the discrepancy in the stated probability.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question here about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So when an electron transitions, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, so n goes from 3 to 1. Since it's a two-step process via dipole transitions, the decay probably goes through an intermediate state.

Let me think about possible intermediates. From n=3, l=0, transitioning via a dipole would require l to go to l=1 because Δl=±1. So the first transition would go from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state would have l=1, and m can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, the initial m is 0. So the first transition could go to m=0, +1, or -1. So the possible intermediate states after the first transition would be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Then, from that intermediate state, another dipole transition would take it to n=1, l=0.

Wait, because from l=1, the next transition would have to go to l=0 (since 1-1=0). So the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. So for each intermediate state, let's check if it can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Let's take each option:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first, from l=0 to l=1, m remains 0. Then, from l=1 to l=0. But wait, when l=1, m is 0. So the second transition would need to have Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, the next m can be 0, +1, or -1. But the final state is m=0, so it's allowed. So this is a possible path.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first, from m=0 to m=1. Then, from m=1, the next transition can go to m=0, 1, or 2. But the final state has m=0. So that's allowed. So this is also a possible path.

Similarly, option C is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩. First, m goes from 0 to -1. Then, from m=-1, it can go to m=-2 (but l=0 would have m=0 only), so wait, no, the second state is |2,1,-1⟩. So for the second transition, the m must go from -1 to 0 (since the final m is 0). Δm = +1, which is allowed. So that's also a possible path.

Now, the question is about the probability of each transition. I think the transition probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements in the dipole approximation, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact expressions. But I remember that for each allowed transition, the probability is proportional to certain factors, like the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the square of the transition dipole moment.

Wait, in hydrogen, the transition probability from state |n', l', m'> to |n, l, m> is given by the square of the integral involving the spherical harmonics. So for the dipole transition, the integral is proportional to <n', l', m' | r · ε> |n, l, m>, where ε is the polarization vector. This can be broken down into components of the dipole operator.

The matrix element involves the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} and the dipole operator components. The dipole operator has components proportional to r Y_{1, m}, where m is -1, 0, +1. So when you take the product of Y_{l', m'} and Y_{1, m_dipole}, you can get terms that project onto Y_{l, m}.

The integral ∫ Y_{l',m'}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{l, m} dΩ is non-zero only if certain conditions are met, like the selection rules. But the actual value depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine how the angular momenta combine.

I think the probability amplitude for a transition from l' to l is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l' and 1 (the dipole) into l. So when you go from l_initial to l_final via l_dipole=1, the possible transitions are only when |l_initial - l_dipole| ≤ l_final ≤ l_initial + l_dipole. So from l=0 to l=1, that's allowed.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is l=0, n=3. The first transition is to l=1, n=2. Then from l=1, n=2 to l=0, n=1.

So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1, and the second is from l=1 to l=0.

Now, considering the m values, for each step, the change in m can be -1, 0, +1. So in each step, the m can change by up to ±1.

So, for each step, the transition can cause m to change by 0, ±1.

But the overall probability for each step is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So for each step, the allowed m transitions have certain probabilities.

Wait, but in the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩, the initial m is 0. So the dipole transition can cause m to change by 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m's for the intermediate state are 0, +1, -1. Each of these has a certain transition probability.

So for the first transition, what is the probability distribution of the m in the intermediate state?

The matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_1^k | 3,0,0>, where k is the component of the dipole (could be +1, 0, -1). Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selection rules for m.

Wait, the dipole operator components are proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}. So when you have an initial state Y_{0,0}, the matrix element for the transition to Y_{1, m} would involve integrating Y_{1, m}^* Y_{1, k} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, but integrating Y_{1, m}^* Y_{1, k} Y_{0,0} is the same as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining (1, m) and (1, k) to get (0,0). Because Y_{0,0} is the result of combining Y_{1,m} and Y_{1,k}.

Wait, no, the integral is zero unless m + k = 0. Because the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{l' m'} would be non-zero only if m' = m + k. Oh wait, but initial state is Y_{00}, so m' is 0. So for the integral to be non-zero, m + k = 0.

So k = -m. So when transitioning from Y_{0,0}, the only allowed m values are those where k = -m, because ∫ Y_{1 m}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{00} dΩ = something non-zero only when m + k = 0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When you have a transition from |n, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n', l=1, m'⟩, the transition is allowed if the integral of Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1, ±1, 0} Y_{00} is non-zero. Wait, maybe it's more precise to model the dipole operator as having components proportional to Y_{1 m}, where m = -1, 0, +1.

So the transition amplitude is proportional to the sum over these components. So for each possible m' in the intermediate state, the matrix element is a sum over k (the dipole component) of <2,1,m' | Y_{1,k} | 3,0,0>.

But the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}. So the matrix element is proportional to the sum over k of <2,1,m' | Y_{1,k} | 3,0,0>.

Wait, but Y_{1,k} for k=-1,0,+1. So let's calculate each term.

The integral <2,1,m' | Y_{1,k} | 3,0,0> is zero unless certain conditions are met. But wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1,k}, so the transition would involve integrating Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, k} Y_{0,0}.

But wait, Y_{0,0} is a constant, so the integral becomes Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, k} times Y_{0,0} integrated over all solid angles. Wait, but Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so integrating Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, k} * (1/sqrt(4π)) dΩ would be (1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * [ (sqrt(4π/(3)) ) δ_{m', -k} }, wait, no. The integral ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{0 0} dΩ is the same as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining (1, m') and (1, k) to get (0, 0), multiplied by some factors.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding two angular momenta j1 and j2 to get j and m. In this case, j1=1, j2=1, j=0, m=0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient CG(j1, m1; j2, m2 | j, m) is zero unless m1 + m2 = m. Here, m is 0, so m1 + m2 = 0.

So for our integral to be non-zero, m' + k = 0. So k = -m'.

And the value of CG is non-zero only when the sum of m's is zero, and the total angular momentum is 0. So the non-zero CG would be for when (1, m') and (1, -m') combine to give (0,0).

The CG coefficient for (1, m') and (1, -m') to produce (0,0) is sqrt( ( (1 - |m'| + |m'|) )/( ... wait, I think the CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=1, j=0, m=0 are known. Let me recall: the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 to get l=0. So for each possible m' and k=-m', the CG is sqrt( ( ( (j1 + j2 + j) ) ( ... )).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the integral ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{0 0} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient CG(1, m'; 1, k | 0,0). Which is non-zero only when m' + k = 0. And for j=0, the CG coefficients are known.

The CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=1, j=0:

For m1 = 1, m2 = -1: CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

For m1=0, m2=0: CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) = 1.

For m1=-1, m2=1: CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. I think the correct CG coefficients for adding two l=1 states to j=0 are:

The possible combinations are (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = 0. So possible pairs are (1, -1), (0, 0), (-1,1).

The CG coefficients for these are:

- For (m1=1, m2=-1): CG = 1/sqrt(2).

- For (m1=0, m2=0): CG = 1.

- For (m1=-1, m2=1): CG = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but when adding two l=1 states to get l=0, the CGs are given by:

CG(1, m1; 1, m2 | 0, 0) = 0 unless m1 + m2 = 0. When m1 + m2 =0, the CG is:

sqrt( (2 + 1)/( (1 + 1 + 1) ) ) ) * something? Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to remember that the CG coefficients for j=0 are:

For m=0, the possible combinations:

(1, -1): coefficient is 1/sqrt(2),

(0, 0): coefficient is 1,

(-1, 1): coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

But wait, perhaps the actual CG coefficients for j=0, m=0 are:

CG(1, m1; 1, m2 | 0,0) = √( ( (j1 + j2 - j) ( ... ) ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, considering that the possible ways to combine two l=1 vectors to get l=0 are by combining m=1 and m=-1, or m=0 and m=0, or m=-1 and m=1.

The states |1,1⟩ and |1,-1⟩ combine to form |0,0⟩, and their coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each. Similarly, |1,0⟩ combines with itself to form |0,0⟩ with coefficient 1. So the overall CG for |0,0⟩ in terms of the product states is:

|0,0⟩ = ( |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩ + |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ * 1.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The correct combination is:

|0,0⟩ = ( |1,1⟩⊗|1,-1⟩ + |1,-1⟩⊗|1,1⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + |1,0⟩⊗|1,0⟩ * 1.

Wait, no, actually, the CG coefficient for |1, m⟩ ⊗ |1, m'⟩ → |0,0⟩ is zero unless m + m' = 0. So for each pair where m + m' = 0, the CG coefficient is:

When m = +1 and m' = -1: CG = 1/sqrt(2),

m=0, m'=0: CG = 1,

m=-1, m'=+1: CG = 1/sqrt(2).

So, the integral ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 k} Y_{0 0} dΩ is proportional to CG(1, m'; 1, k | 0, 0). But since the initial state is Y_{00}, which is |00⟩, the integral would be non-zero only when m' + k =0, and the value is proportional to the CG coefficient.

So, for each possible m' in the intermediate state, the transition is allowed if m' + k =0 for some k. But in the dipole transition, the possible k values are -1, 0, +1. So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, ±1.

Wait, because from m=0, k can be 0, +1, or -1. So m' = m_initial + k = 0 + k. So possible m' are 0, +1, -1.

So the possible transitions after the first step are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.

But each transition has a different probability, which is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient.

So let's compute the transition probabilities for each m':

1. m'=0:

In this case, k=0 (because m' =0, so k=0). The CG coefficient is CG(1,0;1,0 | 0,0) = 1.

So the matrix element for this transition is proportional to 1.

2. m'=+1:

Here, k must be -1, because m' + k =0 → k = -1.

The CG coefficient is CG(1,1;1,-1 | 0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the matrix element is proportional to 1/sqrt(2).

3. m'=-1:

Here, k must be +1. The CG coefficient is CG(1,-1;1,1 | 0,0) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the matrix element is proportional to 1/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities are proportional to (1)^2, (1/sqrt(2))^2, and (1/sqrt(2))^2.

Which gives probabilities of 1, 1/2, and 1/2 respectively.

But wait, the sum of the probabilities should be 1. Because from state |3,0,0⟩, the transitions to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩ are the only possible dipole transitions. So the total probability would be the sum of the squares.

Calculating the sum: 1 + (1/2) + (1/2) = 2. But that's not possible because probabilities must sum to 1.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability to each state is not just the square of the CG, but the square of the sum of CG coefficients multiplied by some factors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me think again.

The transition amplitude for a given m' is the sum over k of the product of the CG coefficients.

Wait, no. The transition amplitude is proportional to the integral of Y_{1 m'}^* (dipole component) Y_{00} dΩ.

But the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to Y_{1, ±1}, Y_{1,0}, etc.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator components are each proportional to Y_{1, m}, so the matrix element would be the sum over m_dipole of <2,1,m' | Y_{1, m_dipole} |3,0,0>.

Each term in the sum is non-zero only if m' + m_dipole =0.

Because m_dipole can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each m_dipole:

If m_dipole = -1 → m' = +1,

m_dipole = 0 → m' =0,

m_dipole = +1 → m' =-1.

So the three possible terms are non-zero only for these respective m' values.

The matrix element for each m' is:

For m'=0: dipole component m_dipole=0.

So <2,1,0 | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0> is proportional to CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) =1.

For m'=+1: dipole component m_dipole=-1.

So <2,1,+1 | Y_{1,-1} |3,0,0> is proportional to CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

For m'=-1: dipole component m_dipole=+1.

So <2,1,-1 | Y_{1,1} |3,0,0> is proportional to CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

Now, the transition probability for each m' is the square of the amplitude.

So:

- P(m'=0) = (1)^2 =1,

- P(m'=+1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2,

- P(m'=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

But wait, the sum is 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 =2, which can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Ah, I think I'm missing a normalization factor here. Because the dipole operator has three components, each contributing to a different m'.

The actual transition probability is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for each allowed m'.

But each amplitude is proportional to the CG coefficient, and the dipole operator might have an overall factor that includes a normalization.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator is proportional to sqrt( some factor ) multiplied by Y_{1 m}. So the overall amplitude for each transition would have a factor that includes this normalization.

Wait, the dipole operator is often written as e r Y_{1 m}, so the matrix element would be proportional to e times the integral of Y_{1 m}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1 l'}, where l' is the initial or final state. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe I should think in terms of the electric dipole selection rules and the associated transition probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the probability of each transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that transition.

So, for each possible m' in the intermediate state, the transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is proportional to (CG coefficient)^2.

Given that, for m'=0, the CG coefficient is 1, so the probability is 1.

For m'=+1, CG is 1/sqrt(2), so the probability is 1/2.

Similarly, for m'=-1, the probability is 1/2.

But this would imply that the sum of probabilities is 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2, which is impossible.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Maybe the actual probabilities are normalized such that the sum is 1. So perhaps each probability is (CG coefficient)^2 divided by the sum of all (CG coefficient)^2 for all allowed transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is not directly the square of the CG coefficient, but involves other factors like the overlap between the states and the dipole operator.

Wait, another approach: The total transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to any state |2,1,m'⟩ is 1, because it's a two-step process, but the first step must go to some |2,1,m'⟩ state, and then the second step takes it to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but the question is about the overall probability of the two-step decay path. So perhaps each possible intermediate state contributes a certain fraction to the total decay probability.

Hmm, perhaps each possible intermediate state has a certain transition probability, and the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each possible path.

So, considering all possible intermediate states, the decay can happen via three possible paths: to m'=0, m'=+1, m'=-1.

Each path has a certain probability, and the overall probability would be the sum of these.

Now, for each intermediate state, the second transition must also be considered. The second transition is from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, the transition is dipole, so Δl=1 (from l=1 to l=0), and Δm=0, ±1.

So for each m', what is the probability of transitioning to m=0?

Let me think about each case.

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩.

From m'=0, the next transition can have m change by 0, ±1. So, possible m's in the final state are 0, 1, -1.

But the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m=0.

So the transition from m'=0 must have Δm=0.

What is the probability of that transition?

Again, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,k} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, no. The second transition is from l=1 to l=0. So the dipole operator has components Y_{1, m_dipole}, and the transition is |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element is proportional to <1,0,0 | Y_{1, m_dipole} | 2,1,m'⟩.

Which is non-zero only if m' + m_dipole =0, because the final state has m=0.

So m_dipole = -m'.

So the allowed m_dipole are:

- If m'=0 → m_dipole=0,

- m'=+1 → m_dipole=-1,

- m'=-1 → m_dipole=+1.

The matrix element is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining (1, m') and (1, -m') to get (0,0).

So for each m', the CG coefficient is:

- m'=0: CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) =1,

- m'=+1: CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2),

- m'=-1: CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

So the amplitude for each case is proportional to the CG coefficient.

The probability is the square of the amplitude.

Therefore, for each intermediate state:

- If intermediate is |2,1,0⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has probability (1)^2 =1.

- If intermediate is |2,1,1⟩, the transition has probability (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

- If intermediate is |2,1,-1⟩, the transition has probability (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

Now, putting it all together.

Each first transition to |2,1,m'⟩ has a certain probability, and from there, each transition to |1,0,0⟩ has another probability.

So the total probability for each path is (probability of first transition) × (probability of second transition).

So:

Path 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

P1 = P_3→2_0 × P_2_0→1_0.

Earlier, the first transition P_3→2_0 is proportional to (1)^2=1. But wait, from earlier, I thought the probabilities sum to 2, which isn't possible. So perhaps I should normalize the first transition probabilities.

Wait, the first transition probabilities sum to 1, because the initial state must transition to one of the possible |2,1,m'⟩ states.

Wait, the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to any |2,1,m'⟩ is 100%, so the sum of all possible P_3→2_m' must be 1.

But earlier, the probabilities came out to 1 (for m'=0), 0.5 (m'=+1), 0.5 (m'=-1). Sum is 2, which is not possible.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Maybe the correct approach is that the first transition probability to each m' is (CG coefficient)^2 multiplied by some normalization.

Wait, perhaps the first transition probabilities are:

P(m'=0) = (1)^2 × (something),

P(m'=+1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 × (something),

P(m'=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 × (something).

But the sum of P(m') must be 1.

Wait, another approach: The sum of all possible transition probabilities from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is 1. So each m' has a certain probability, say P(m').

But for the first step, the probability for each m' is (CG coefficient)^2 multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to a different m_dipole. So the transition amplitude for each m' is the sum over m_dipole of the product of the CG coefficients.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again: the transition amplitude for a given m' is the sum over m_dipole of <2,1,m' | Y_{1, m_dipole} |3,0,0>.

Each term is proportional to the CG coefficient for that m_dipole.

But the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for all possible m' must be 1, since the initial state must transition to some state.

So, for the first step, the transition probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) for each m' are:

P(m'=0) = |a0|^2,

P(m'=+1) = |a+1|^2,

P(m'=-1) = |a-1|^2,

with a0, a+1, a-1 being the respective amplitudes.

Each a is given by:

a0 = CG(1,0;1,0 |0,0) =1,

a+1 = CG(1,1;1,-1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2),

a-1 = CG(1,-1;1,1 |0,0) =1/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities are:

P0 = (1)^2 =1,

P+1 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2,

P-1 = (1/sqrt(2))^2=1/2.

But sum =1 + 0.5 + 0.5=2. So this can't be right.

Ah! I think I see the mistake. The dipole operator has three components. So the matrix element for each m' is the sum over the three components, each contributing a term. So the transition amplitude for each m' is the sum over m_dipole of the product of the CG coefficient and the dipole component contribution.

Wait, perhaps each component of the dipole operator contributes equally. So the total amplitude is the sum over the three possible dipole components, each contributing a term proportional to their respective CG coefficients.

So, for the initial state |3,0,0⟩:

The amplitude for each m' is the sum over m_dipole of [ CG(1, m'; 1, m_dipole |0,0) × (dipole component) ].

Assuming each dipole component (Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}) contributes equally, their contributions would be summed.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator's components are all normalized the same, so the total amplitude for each m' is the sum of the CG coefficients for each m_dipole.

In that case:

a0 = sum over m_dipole of CG(1,0;1,m_dipole |0,0) × (Y_{1, m_dipole} component).

Wait, but how? It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the transition probability from |n, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n', l=1, m'⟩ is proportional to (2l+1) × delta_{m',0} + ... Wait, no, that's for electric quadrupole transitions, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: The transition probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the number of ways to reach that m' via the dipole components.

So, for m'=0: there's only one way (m_dipole=0),

for m'=+1: only one way (m_dipole=-1),

for m'=-1: only one way (m_dipole=+1).

Each of these processes has a certain weight. Since the dipole operator has three components, perhaps each contributes equally, so each has a weight of 1/3.

But that's not right because the CG coefficients for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=±1 it's 1/sqrt(2), as we saw earlier.

Wait, another approach: The transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩ is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that transition. So let's calculate the squares.

The CG coefficients are:

m'=0: 1,

m'=+1: 1/sqrt(2),

m'=-1: 1/sqrt(2).

So the squares are 1, 1/2, 1/2.

But these sum to 2, which is not possible. So perhaps I should normalize by dividing each by 2.

So the probabilities would be:

P(m'=0) = (1^2) / 2 = 1/2,

P(m'=+1) = (1/2)/2 = 1/4,

P(m'=-1) = (1/2)/2 =1/4.

Wait, sum is 1/2 +1/4 +1/4 =1. That makes sense.

So, the first transition probabilities are:

P(m'=0)=1/2,

P(m'=+1)=1/4,

P(m'=-1)=1/4.

Then, from each intermediate state, the probability to transition to |1,0,0⟩ is as calculated earlier.

So, for each path:

Path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Probability is P1 * P2.

P1 is 1/2.

From |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the transition probability is 1 (as earlier, because m'=0 requires m_dipole=0, and the CG is 1).

So P2 is 1.

So path A contributes (1/2) * 1 = 1/2.

Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

P1 is 1/4.

From |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the m_dipole must be -1, so the CG is 1/sqrt(2), so P2 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

So path B contributes (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.

Similarly, Path C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

P1=1/4,

P2=1/2,

So contribution is (1/4)*(1/2)=1/8.

So the total probability is sum of all path contributions.

Only possible paths are A, B, and C.

So total P = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2 + 2/8 = 1/2 + 1/4= 3/4.

Wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so perhaps the only two possible paths are A and D, but wait, looking back at the options, the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, the options are:

A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  with probability 1/3.

B) → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 1/4.

C) → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 1/4.

D) → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 2/3.

Wait, according to my calculation, the total probability is 3/4. But none of the options have 3/4. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the total probability of all possible paths, but about a specific route, which is only one of the possible paths. So the options are about which single two-step path is possible and what's its probability.

Wait, that's possible. So each option is a specific path and its probability. So, for example, option A is the path via |2,1,0⟩, and says the probability is 1/3.

But according to my earlier calculations, the probability for path A is 1/2, from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ (1/2), then → |1,0,0⟩ (1), so total 1/2.

But option A has 1/3. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition via each path as being a specific probability, not the sum of all paths.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the probability of a specific two-step decay, not the total probability. So if the decay goes via |2,1,0⟩, what is the probability of that particular path.

But the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So perhaps each option is suggesting a particular route, and its probability.

But according to the calculation for path A, the probability is 1/2. But option A says 1/3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probabilities for each possible path, and see which options match.

So, path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The first transition probability is 1/2.

The second transition probability is 1.

So overall, 1/2 *1 =1/2.

But option A says the probability is 1/3, which doesn't match.

Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

First transition: 1/4.

Second transition: 1/2.

Total: 1/4 * 1/2 =1/8.

Option B says probability is 1/4, which doesn't match.

Path C: same as B, probability is 1/8. Option C says 1/4, which doesn't match.

Path D: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Same as path A, but option D says probability is 2/3.

Hmm, none of the options match the calculated probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial probabilities.

Let me re-examine the first transition.

The initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to |2,1,m'⟩ for m'=0, ±1.

The transition probability to each m' is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient.

The CG coefficients are:

m'=0: CG=1,

m'=+1: CG=1/sqrt(2),

m'=-1: CG=1/sqrt(2).

But the sum of squares is 1 + 1/2 +1/2 =2, which is more than 1. So we must normalize the probabilities by dividing each by 2.

So,

P(m'=0) = (1)^2 / 2 =1/2,

P(m'=+1) = (1/2)/2 =1/4,

P(m'=-1)=1/4.

So, the first transition probabilities are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4.

Now, for each path, the second transition's probability is:

For path A (m'=0): the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is certain (prob 1).

So path A's total probability is 1/2 *1=1/2.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the total probability of all possible two-step paths, but about the probability of a specific two-step path, regardless of others.

But the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions, so perhaps all possible paths are considered, and their probabilities are summed.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the transition route and the corresponding probability are", which suggests that the correct option includes a specific route and its probability.

So, perhaps I'm supposed to find which of the options correctly describes a possible route and gives the correct probability for that route.

So in option A, the route is via |2,1,0⟩, and the probability is 1/3.

But according to my calculation, the probability for this route is 1/2.

So option A can't be correct.

Option B: route via |2,1,1⟩, probability 1/4.

According to calculation, the probability for this route is 1/4 * 1/2 =1/8.

Which doesn't match.

Option C: route via |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Probability is also 1/8, so option C isn't correct.

Option D: route via |2,1,0⟩, probability 2/3.

But according to calculation, it's 1/2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the second transition probabilities.

Wait, for the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that transition.

So, for example, for m'=0:

The CG coefficient is 1, so P =1.

For m'=+1: CG is 1/sqrt(2), so P=1/2.

For m'=-1: CG is 1/sqrt(2), so P=1/2.

So for each path:

A: 1/2 *1 =1/2,

B: 1/4 *1/2=1/8,

C:1/4 *1/2=1/8.

Total probability is 1/2 +1/8 +1/8= 3/4.

But the question is about a specific path, not the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the total probability but about the probability of each possible path, and which option correctly states a possible path with its specific probability.

Wait, but the options present only one route and its probability. So perhaps the correct answer is the option where the route is via |2,1,0⟩, with probability 1/3, but according to my calculation, it's 1/2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can only decay via certain allowed transitions. For example, perhaps certain m' are not allowed due to parity or other selection rules.

Wait, but the selection rule for dipole transitions is Δl=±1, which is met here.

Another thought: perhaps the transition probability is not just the product of the two step probabilities, but there's another factor involved, such as the overlap between the states.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of the transition probabilities for the different paths.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the possible first steps are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

The second step from each of these can reach |1,0,0⟩ with certain probabilities.

So the total probability for each path is the product of the first and second step probabilities.

So, for each path:

A: (1/2) *1=1/2,

B: (1/4)*(1/2)=1/8,

C: (1/4)*(1/2)=1/8,

D: same as A, but option D's probability is 2/3.

So the total probability is 1/2 +1/8 +1/8= 3/4.

But the question isn't about the total, but about a single path.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but according to calculations, it's 1/2. So why would option A say 1/3?

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules are such that only certain transitions are allowed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions actually has to go through certain intermediates that have the same parity.

Wait, the parity of the states is given by (-1)^l.

So |3,0,0⟩ has parity (-1)^0=1.

|2,1,0⟩ has parity (-1)^1=-1.

|1,0,0⟩ has parity 1.

So the transition from l=0 (parity +1) to l=1 (parity -1) is allowed for the first step. Then, from l=1 (-1) to l=0 (+1), which is allowed.

So that's fine.

But perhaps the correct option is only one of the possibilities, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is 2/3.

But according to my calculation, the probability for this path is 1/2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible initial and final states and the possible intermediates.

Wait, another approach: the transition from n=3 to n=1 in hydrogen can be achieved in a single dipole transition (Δn=±1), but since the question specifies two dipole transitions, it must go through an intermediate state.

So the possible intermediates are n=2, since 3 →2 →1.

So the only possible intermediate is n=2, l=1.

Therefore, the possible routes are the ones given in the options.

Now, the question is about the probability of each specific route.

So, perhaps the probability isn't just the product of the two step probabilities, but the square of a certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the probability is calculated as the square of the product of the two CG coefficients.

So for the route via |2,1,0⟩, the total probability is (1) * (1) =1, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the matrix elements for each two-step transition.

The overall transition amplitude is the product of the two step amplitudes.

So for path A:

Amplitude1: 1 (from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩),

Amplitude2: 1 (from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩),

so overall amplitude is 1 *1=1.

Similarly, for path B:

Amplitude1:1/sqrt(2),

Amplitude2:1/sqrt(2),

so amplitude is 1/2,

so probability is (1/2)^2=1/4.

Wait, no. Because each amplitude is a separate step, the overall amplitude is the product.

Wait, but each step's amplitude is the matrix element for that step.

So for path A:

A1 = <2,1,0 | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0> =1,

A2 = <1,0,0 | Y_{1,0} |2,1,0> =1,

so overall amplitude is 1*1=1.

But this can't be right, because the probabilities can't exceed 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall amplitude is the product of the two step amplitudes, and the probability is the square of the product.

But each step's amplitude is proportional to the CG coefficient.

So for path A:

A1 =1,

A2=1,

so overall amplitude =1 *1=1,

probability=1^2=1.

But the total probability from all paths must be 1.

But according to this, path A would have probability 1, which can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another thought: perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions is only allowed through certain intermediates, and each intermediate contributes a certain fraction.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the allowed transitions have to obey additional selection rules, such as the change in n being ±1 in each step.

Since n=3 →2 is allowed (Δn= -1), and 2→1 is allowed (Δn=-1), the steps are allowed.

Another consideration: the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/2, as calculated earlier. From there, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has probability 1.

So the total probability for this path is 1/2.

But none of the options have this.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the probability is 2/3, but our calculation says 1/2.

Wait, perhaps there's a factor of 2 somewhere I'm missing. For example, perhaps the dipole operator has a factor that includes a sqrt(2), and when squared, contributes a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall transition probability is given by the product of the probabilities of each step, but each step's probability is the square of the CG coefficient multiplied by a factor.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps the transition probabilities for each step are not 1/2, 1/4, 1/4, but different.

Wait, perhaps the initial transition probabilities are determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients divided by the number of possible m's.

Wait, for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, the possible m's are 0, ±1.

The CG coefficients are 1, 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2).

Squares are 1, 0.5, 0.5.

Sum is 2.

So probabilities are (1/2, 1/4, 1/4).

So the first step probabilities are correct.

Then, the second step from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

For m'=0: CG=1, P=1,

m'=+1: CG=1/sqrt(2), P=0.5,

m'=-1: CG=1/sqrt(2), P=0.5.

So path probabilities:

A: 1/2 *1 =1/2,

B:1/4 *0.5=1/8,

C:1/4 *0.5=1/8.

Total 1/2 +1/8 +1/8 = 3/4.

But the question is about the probability of the two-step transition, so the total probability would be 3/4.

But none of the options have 3/4.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) probability 1/3,

B) 1/4,

C)1/4,

D) 2/3.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm miscalculating the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is not allowed. But no, because Δl=1, and m=0 →m=0 is allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is forbidden for some reason.

But the selection rules allow it, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the transition is allowed only for certain combinations of angular momentum, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I should select it because the transition via |2,1,0⟩ is the only possible one.

But according to selection rules, the other transitions are allowed too.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible routes and their probabilities again.

Wait, maybe I should consider only the possible transitions where the total angular momentum is conserved.

Wait, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state and the intermediate state have the same parity, which is not the case.

|3,0,0⟩ has parity +1, |2,1,0⟩ has parity -1, |1,0,0⟩ has parity +1.

So the parity changes correctly in each step.

So it's allowed.

Another approach: perhaps the correct probability is 2/3, which is option D.

But according to my earlier calculation, the probability for path A is 1/2.

So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 2/3, as in option D.

But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities in terms of the number of available paths.

Wait, there are three possible intermediates, but perhaps only one of them leads to the final state.

Wait, no, all three intermediates can lead to the final state.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's the only option where the intermediate is l=1, m=0, which is a possible route.

But according to the probabilities, the path A has a higher probability than any other, but the options don't reflect that.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe the answer is option A, because the probability is 1/3.

But according to my earlier calculation, it's 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition via |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, perhaps the overall transition probability is given by the sum over all possible intermediates of (CG1 * CG2)^2, where CG1 is the first step CG and CG2 is the second step CG.

So for path A:

(1*1)^2=1.

But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the product of the two CG coefficients squared.

For path A: (1)^2 * (1)^2 =1.

But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A with a probability of 1/3 because there are three possible intermediates, each with equal probability.

But earlier calculation shows that the probabilities are not equal.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm not making progress and should make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct transition route is via |2,1,0⟩, as this is the only state where m remains 0, which might maximize the probability.

So the correct option is A, but according to my calculation, the probability is 1/2. However, since option A says 1/3, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which says the probability is 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But why 1/3?

Wait, perhaps the initial transition probabilities are each 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, but that doesn't align with the CG coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, and I should proceed with that.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis begins by recalling the selection rules for electric dipole transitions: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) can decay to |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0) through an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1). The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩, each with specific transition probabilities.

### Key Calculations:
1. **First Transition Probabilities**:
   - The transition probabilities from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
     - P(m'=0) = 1/2,
     - P(m'=+1) = 1/4,
     - P(m'=-1) = 1/4.
   - These probabilities sum to 1, ensuring normalization.

2. **Second Transition Probabilities**:
   - From each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the probability to transition to |1,0,0⟩ is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
     - From |2,1,0⟩: P = 1,
     - From |2,1,1⟩: P = 1/2,
     - From |2,1,-1⟩: P = 1/2.

3. **Total Probability for Each Path**:
   - Path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:
     - P = (1/2) * 1 = 1/2.
   - Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:
     - P = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.
   - Path C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:
     - P = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.
   - Total probability = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/4.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3. However, the calculated probability for this path is 1/2, not 1/3. This option is inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option B**: States that the transition is via |2,1,1⟩ with a probability of 1/4. The calculated probability for this path is 1/8, not 1/4. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: States that the transition is via |2,1,-1⟩ with a probability of 1/4. The calculated probability for this path is 1/8, not 1/4. This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: States that the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with a probability of 2/3. The calculated probability for this path is 1/2, not 2/3. This option is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is via |2,1,0⟩, as this is the most probable path. However, none of the options correctly match the calculated probabilities. Based on the given options, **Option A** is the closest match, despite the discrepancy in the stated probability.
