Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again. The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, with various exponents of eV.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle and energy-time uncertainty relation. Oh right! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

In this problem, the lifetimes of the states are given. I think the uncertainty in time Δt is related to the lifetime of the state. If the lifetime is shorter, the uncertainty in energy is higher because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt.

Wait, so for each state, the energy uncertainty would be approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me write that down. For E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

The energy difference needed to clearly distinguish the two states should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable. So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, wait, wait. Or is it that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in each state? Because each state has its own uncertainty, so maybe the total uncertainty is the sum. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps each state's energy is not precisely known, and the uncertainty in each would affect how well we can tell them apart. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the combined uncertainties of both states. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute each ΔE. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert that into eV·s, since 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s ≈ 6.582e-7 eV. Wait, that's 6.582 x 1e-7 eV, which is 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. So about 6.582e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let's compute that sum: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.2402e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me check the numbers again. Oh, wait, 6.582e-7 is 0.6582e-6, and 6.582e-8 is 0.06582e-6. Their sum is approximately 0.724e-6 eV. So about 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but our options are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV. None of these options are close to 7.24e-7 eV. So maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which lifetimes I used. The question says the lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, but which one is which? Let me look again. The first state has τ1 = 1e-9 s, the second τ2 = 1e-8 s. So yes, as I did earlier.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each, but perhaps the combined uncertainty is the maximum of the two uncertainties, not the sum. Because the uncertainty in the measurement of energy would be determined by the shorter lifetime, because shorter τ gives larger uncertainty.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's think in another way. The energy of each state is not precisely known, but given the respective lifetimes, each has an uncertainty. But when distinguishing two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because otherwise, the energy levels could overlap in the uncertainty ranges.

Wait, for example, if two energies are E1 and E2, and each has uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2, then to clearly distinguish them, E2 - E1 must be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if E2 - E1 is less than ΔE1 + ΔE2, the ranges [E1 - ΔE1, E1 + ΔE1] and [E2 - ΔE2, E2 + ΔE2] might overlap. So the difference needs to be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties.

So, let me calculate the sum of the two uncertainties. For τ1=1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

For τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, so the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 7e-7, so that's 100 times larger than 7e-6 (wait wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, 7e-7 is 0.7e-6, which is 0.0000007 eV. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger in the 7e-7. So option C is way bigger than the required 7e-7 eV. So it's definitely possible.

But wait, what about the other options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7. So can't distinguish.

Option B: 1e-11 eV, way too small.

Option D: 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-7 eV, which is also smaller than 7.24e-7 eV. So only option C is larger than the required sum of uncertainties.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the sum is approximately 7e-7 eV, and option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. So 1e-4 is larger than 7e-7, so that's acceptable.

But wait, the question asks for the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct option must be C) 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \).

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

So for τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s ≈ 6.582e-7 eV. Wait, that's 6.582 x 1e-7 eV, which is 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. So about 6.582e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let's compute that sum: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.2402e-7 eV.

So, let me calculate the sum of the two uncertainties. For τ1=1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

For τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, so the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7. So can't distinguish.

Option B: 1e-11 eV, way too small.

Option D: 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-7 eV, which is also smaller than 7.24e-7 eV. So only option C is larger than the required sum of uncertainties.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the sum is approximately 7e-7 eV, and option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. So 1e-4 is larger than 7e-7, so that's acceptable.

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
