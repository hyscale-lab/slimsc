Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx = 1/distance or something like that. Wait, the formula is usually plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. Oh, right, so if the distance r increases, the parallax plx decreases. 

So the problem says number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in would give N proportional to (r)^5. Because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5, which would mean that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so it's about the number density or the rate of change with distance, not the total number.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. Let's say the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = k/r, where k is some constant. Then, 1/plx is r/k. So 1/plx^5 would be (r/k)^5 = r^5/(k^5).

So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases with r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, maybe it's about the differential number of stars with respect to distance. Like, how many more stars are there when you move a small step in r, say dr.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is the derivative. Let me compute that. If N = C * r^5, then dN/dr = 5C r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Oh, but wait, the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5, so in terms of distance. So perhaps I need to model N as a function of r.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area times the thickness. Wait, but that's more for a volume consideration. Let me think.

Wait, no. The way star counts work: the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on how bright they are and how far away they are. But in this case, the problem says the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is given. So the number of stars in a region is inversely proportional to plx^5.

But plx is 1/r, so 1/plx = r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But that's the cumulative number up to r? Or is it the density? I might be getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/r. Therefore, plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. 

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range. So if N increases as r^5, then the rate at which N increases with r would be the derivative. dN/dr = 5C r^4, where C is the constant of proportionality. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. 

Looking back at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's define N as a function of r. N(r) = K * r^5, where K is a constant. Then, the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5 K r^4. So per unit distance, the number increases as r^4. So the correct option is C, which is ~r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). If \( N = C \cdot r^5 \), where \( C \) is a constant of proportionality, then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = 5C \cdot r^4
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
