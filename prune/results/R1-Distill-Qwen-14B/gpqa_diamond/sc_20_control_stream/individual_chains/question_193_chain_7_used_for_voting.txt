Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax^5). And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance r?

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs, I think), but wait, that would make distance = 1 / plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 over (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me do the math carefully.

If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So yeah, N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, actually, the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of distance. So I think it's about the differential number of stars, like, how many stars are there between r and r + dr, or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differentials. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell. Oh, right, because the number of stars depends on the volume available at that distance. So the number of stars in a small volume dV would be N = n * dV, where n is the number density.

But wait, in this problem, N is given to vary as 1/plx^5. Hmm, perhaps I need to relate dN/dr to that. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the number of stars as a function of r. Since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5. But that would mean that as r increases, N increases as r^5. But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, the number of stars in a volume increases with r^3, but maybe not in this case.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/r, N = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's asking about the rate of change of N with respect to r, like dN/dr. Because the number of stars per unit volume would be dN/dV, but here they're asking how N changes as you move along distance r.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. But the region of the sky is fixed, so perhaps they're considering a fixed solid angle, and varying distance. So the volume element in spherical coordinates would be dV = 4π r^2 dr. So the number of stars at radius r would be proportional to N = (number density) * (volume), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a function of distance. So, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr is dN = N(r) * (volume per unit solid angle). Wait, the volume of a shell is 4π r^2 dr. But how does that relate to the given relation N ∝ 1/plx^5?

Alternatively, perhaps the given N is the number of stars in a unit volume. But I'm not sure. Let me try to approach it differently.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, 1/plx = r. So 1/plx^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But wait, in reality, if you go to a larger distance, you can see more stars because the volume is larger. But the number of stars in a given volume would depend on the density. But in this problem, the number of stars is increasing with r^5, which is faster than the usual r^3 scaling of volume.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps the rate of change of N with respect to r is dN/dr.

If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) would go up as r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5, which is k r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So for a given distance r, you have N stars there. So the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5k r^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of distance (like per parsec) increases as r^4. So this would correspond to option C, which is ~ r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. But I don't think so, because the question specifies per unit range of distance, not per unit volume.

So putting it all together, the number of stars in the region increases with r^5, but the change per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = 1/r \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), i.e., \( dN/dr \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( dN/dr \propto r^4 \). 

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.
