Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But what factors affect the probability of that happening?

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right?

The host stars: the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are same. Oh, that's interesting. Because when a star is more massive, you'd think it's bigger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's star is expanding and Planet_1's is more massive but smaller? Or perhaps they're both main-sequence stars but with Planet_1's star being more massive. Wait, the question states both have same radii, so maybe they're similar in size despite the mass difference.

So the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / R_star), or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). Or wait, I think it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (something)), perhaps. Let me think. The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a ). But when a >> R_s, which it usually is, it's approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a). Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1/(a)), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / a), but I'm not sure. Or maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), because the orbital distance is in units of star radius. Let me think. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). Because, the area of the star is π R_s², and the area blocked is π R_p², so the fractional area is (R_p / R_s)^2. But the probability also depends on the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front. That's the geometric probability, which is (R_s + R_p) / a, but since a is much larger than R_s and R_p, it approximates to R_s / a. So the total transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p² R_s) / (R_s² a) ) = R_p² / ( R_s a ). So P ∝ (R_p²) / ( R_s a ). 

Wait, but in the question, the planets' masses are the same, but their radii might not be the same. Wait, wait, the question says the planets have the same masses but doesn't specify radii. Hmm. Oh, wait, the question says both have the same masses, but it doesn't say they have the same radius. So, unless the mass is same but radius varies, but without that info, perhaps I can assume they have the same radius? Or maybe that's not the case. Wait, the transit probability depends on the planet's radius relative to the star's radius. So if the planets have different radii, that would affect the probability. Alternatively, perhaps the question implies that the planets have the same radius? Let's check the question again.

The question says both planets have the same mass. So, if the mass is same, but the radius could vary. But without knowing their radii, I can't compute (R_p)^2 / (R_s a). Hmm, but perhaps the question assumes that the planets have the same radius, as it's not given otherwise. Or maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, the question gives the host stars' radii. Both stars have the same radius. So R_s,1 = R_s,2 = R_s. So that part is same. So the transit probability for each planet depends on R_p and a. But since we don't know R_p for each planet, maybe the assumption is that both planets have the same radius. Because the question says they have the same masses but not same radii. Wait, but mass and radius don't have a direct linear relationship. For example, more massive planets are usually larger, but maybe these are Earth-like, so perhaps same radius. Hmm, but the question says "Earth-like" but doesn't specify radii. So perhaps I can assume R_p1 = R_p2 = R_earth.

Alternatively, perhaps the question doesn't need the planet radii because both have same mass, but that's not directly relevant. Wait, no: the transit probability is about the ratio of planet to star radius, so if the planet's radius is same, then the same R_p, but if the star's radius is same, then (R_p / R_s) is same. So for P1 and P2, if their R_p is same, then the (R_p / R_s) ratio is same. But the a is different.

So for P1, the orbital period is three times shorter than P2. So P1 has a shorter period, so it's orbiting closer to its star, meaning a1 is smaller than a2. Because the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³/(M_star). So if P1 has P1 = P2 /3, then a1³ / M1 = (P1²) = (P2²)/9. And a2³ / M2 = (P2²). So a1³ = (P2² /9) * M1. And a2³ = P2² * M2. 

Given that M1 = 2 M2. So substituting, a1³ = ( (P2²) / 9 ) * (2 M2) ) = (2 P2² M2) / 9. a2³ = P2² M2. So taking the cube root, a1 = [ (2/9)^(1/3) ) ] * (P2² M2 )^(1/3 ) * some factor. Wait, perhaps I should express a1 and a2 in terms of each other.

Let me express a1 in terms of a2. From Kepler's law, P² = (4π² G)⁻1 * (4π² a³)/(G M), so P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for Planet 1: P1 = P2 /3. M1 = 2 M2.

So (P1/P2)^2 = ( (1/3) )² = (a1³ / M1) / (a2³ / M2 )

So (1/9) = (a1³ / (2 M2 )) / (a2³ / M2 ) )

Simplify: (1/9) = (a1³ / 2 M2 ) * (M2 / a2³) ) = a1³ / (2 a2³ )

So 1/9 = (a1³) / (2 a2³ )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³:

2 a2³ /9 = a1³

So a1 = cube root( 2/(9) ) * a2. Let's compute 2/9 ≈ 0.222, so cube root is about 0.6 (since 0.6³=0.216, close to 0.222). So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense since P1 is shorter.

Now, the transit probability for each planet P is proportional to (R_p / R_s )² * ( R_s / a )

Since R_p same, R_s same for both, so P ∝ 1/(a).

Because (R_p^2/R_s^2) * (R_s/a) = R_p²/(R_s a).

Wait, so transit probability is proportional to 1/(a) because R_p and R_s are same for both planets.

Wait, because for both planets, R_p is same? Or are they different?

Wait, the question says both planets have same mass. But if they have same mass, they might have similar radii, but not necessarily same. So without knowing R_p1 and R_p2, can't directly compare. But the question doesn't provide that information, so perhaps the assumption is that their radii are same. Otherwise, we can't proceed. So assuming R_p1 = R_p2.

So, transit probability is proportional to 1/(a).

So, P1 has a smaller a. So 1/a is larger for P1.

Wait, because a is the semi-major axis. So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2. So 1/a1 = 1/(0.6 a2) ≈ 1.666/a2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is 1.666 times higher than that of Planet_2. So the probability is about 1.65 times higher. So P1 is preferred.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher. So where does that come from?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the transit probability formula. Let me reevaluate.

The transit probability is P = π (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2) ) × (something). Or no, perhaps the transit probability is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (R_s / a) ) × (some factor) ?

Wait, I think the exact formula for geometric transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a × (R_p / R_s)^2. But when R_p << R_s, it's approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 × (R_s / a ). So, P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2 / (R_s a )

Since R_p is same for both, and R_s is same, so P ∝ 1/a.

So:

P1's a is (2/9)^(1/3) a2. So 1/a1 is 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3) / a2.

Compute (9/2)^(1/3). 9 is 3², 2 is 2, so (9/2) = 4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65 because 1.65^3 is about 4.489, which is close.

So P1's probability is about 1.65 times higher than P2's.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, since it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like and the host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), we assume \( R_p \) is the same for both planets. Thus, the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
The orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

where \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period).
- \( M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2} \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's).

Using Kepler's law:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{s1}}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2} \):

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2 \cdot M_{s2})}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 \cdot a_2^3}
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} \cdot a_2^3
\]

\[
a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot a_2
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \), we find:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.6 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
Since \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \), the transit probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.6 \cdot a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2}
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting (~1.65 times that of Planet_2).

Wait, no: the transit probability is about the ratio of planet to star radius, so if the planet's radius is same, then the same R_p, but if the star's radius is same, then (R_p / R_s) is same. So for P1 and P2, if their R_p is same, then the (R_p / R_s) ratio is same. But the a is different.

So for P1, the orbital period is three times shorter than P2. So P1 has a shorter period, so it's orbiting closer to its star, meaning a1 is smaller than a2. Because the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³/(M_star). So if P1 has P1 = P2 /3, then a1³ / M1 = (P1²) = (P2²)/9. And a2³ / M2 = (P2²). So a1³ = (P2² /9) * M1. And a2³ = P2² * M2. 

Given that M1 = 2 M2. So substituting, a1³ = ( (P2²) / 9 ) * (2 M2) ) = (2 P2² M2) / 9. a2³ = P2² M2. So taking the cube root, a1 = [ (2/9)^(1/3) ) ] * (P2² M2 )^(1/3 ) * some factor. Wait, perhaps I should express a1 and a2 in terms of each other.

Let me express a1 in terms of a2. From Kepler's law, P² = (4π² G)⁻1 * (4π² a³)/(G M), so P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for Planet 1: P1 = P2 /3. M1 = 2 M2.

So (P1/P2)^2 = ( (1/3) )² = (a1³ / M1) / (a2³ / M2 )

So (1/9) = (a1³ / (2 M2 )) / (a2³ / M2 ) )

Simplify: (1/9) = (a1³ / 2 M2 ) * (M2 / a2³) ) = a1³ / (2 a2³ )

So 1/9 = (a1³) / (2 a2³ )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³:

2 a2³ /9 = a1³

So a1 = cube root( 2/(9) ) * a2. Let's compute 2/9 ≈ 0.222, so cube root is about 0.6 (since 0.6³=0.216, close to 0.222). So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense since P1 is shorter.

Now, the transit probability for each planet P is proportional to (R_p / R_s )² * ( R_s / a )

Since R_p same, R_s same for both, so P ∝ 1/(a).

Because (R_p^2/R_s^2) * (R_s/a) = R_p²/(R_s a).

Wait, so transit probability is proportional to 1/(a) because R_p and R_s are same for both planets.

Wait, because for both planets, R_p is same? Or are they different?

Wait, the question says both planets have same mass. But if they have same mass, they might have similar radii, but not necessarily same. So without knowing R_p1 and R_p2, can't directly compare. But the question doesn't provide that information, so perhaps the assumption is that their radii are same. Otherwise, we can't proceed. So assuming R_p1 = R_p2.

So, transit probability is proportional to 1/(a).

So, P1 has a smaller a. So 1/a is larger for P1.

Wait, because a is the semi-major axis. So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2. So 1/a1 = 1/(0.6 a2) ≈ 1.666/a2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is 1.666 times higher than that of Planet_2. So the probability is about 1.65 times higher. So P1 is preferred.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher. So where does that come from?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the transit probability formula. Let me reevaluate.

The transit probability is P = π (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2) ) × (something). Or no, perhaps the transit probability is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (R_s / a) ) × (some factor) ?

Wait, I think the exact formula for geometric transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a × (R_p / R_s)^2. But when R_p << R_s, it's approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 × (R_s / a ). So, P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2 / (R_s a )

Since R_p is same for both, and R_s is same, so P ∝ 1/a.

So:

P1's a is (2/9)^(1/3) a2. So 1/a1 is 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3) / a2.

Compute (9/2)^(1/3). 9 is 3², 2 is 2, so (9/2) = 4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65 because 1.65^3 is about 4.489, which is close.

So P1's probability is about 1.65 times higher than P2's.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, since it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like and the host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), we assume \( R_p \) is the same for both planets. Thus, the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
The orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

where \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period).
- \( M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2} \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's).

Using Kepler's law:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{s1}}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2} \):

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2 \cdot M_{s2})}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 \cdot a_2^3}
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} \cdot a_2^3
\]

\[
a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot a_2
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \), we find:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.6 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
Since \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \), the transit probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.6 \cdot a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2}
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting (~1.65 times that of Planet_2).
