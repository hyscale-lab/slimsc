Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralization reactions, and pH calculations involve the use of acid-base equilibria.

Alright, let's break it down. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, after dilution, the concentration changes. Wait, how do I calculate the new concentration?

Oh right, molarity is moles divided by volume. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. So when I titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, they'll react in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Next, the titration. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let me handle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH needed would equal the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 mol. So, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

But wait, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, when 25% of this is added, that's 2.5 cm³. But wait, the first part is 25% titration, which would mean that 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me think again. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So up to that point, the NaOH used is 10 cm³. For 25% titration, it's 25% of this volume, so 2.5 cm³. Alternatively, the mole ratio: 25% of the required NaOH is used.

Wait, but when calculating the pH at 25% titration, I need to find the pH before the equivalence point. For such cases, it's a buffer solution.

So, let's approach each part.

First, at 25% titration. The amount of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added. 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. The concentration is 0.1 M, so moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

The reaction of NaOH with acetic acid will convert some of the acetic acid into acetate ions. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- produced = 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

The concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which is about 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So around 4.26.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the ratio and the log.

[acetate] is 0.00025 mol in 0.0425 L → 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

[acetic acid] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.4771. So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529. So approximately 4.25. So the option with 4.26 is option A. But option D has 4.57. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait another thing. Wait, maybe the initial concentration after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me double-check.

Original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ water → total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, but wait—another approach. Alternatively, since both volumes are same, the dilution is 1/2. So the concentration is halved. So 0.05/2 = 0.025 M.

So first part: 25% titration. So 25% of the NaOH needed has been added. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.00025 mol of OH-.

So moles of acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Acetate: 0.00025. So the ratio is 1:3. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 1/3.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So about 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26 which is close. So maybe the first part is 4.26, but wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So the first part is 4.26 in option A. But according to my calculation, that's correct.

Now, the second part: equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic. So acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate will be calculated as follows. Moles of acetate at equivalence: 0.001 mol (since all acetic acid is neutralized). The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) + NaOH volume (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the concentration of OH- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02. Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.5168, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832. pH is 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, the pH is around 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches.

Wait, but wait. The initial calculation gives the pH at equivalence as 8.52, but I thought that for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence pH is determined by the Kb of the conjugate base. So the calculation seems correct.

So the two values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the calculations.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscalculated the volume at equivalence. Let me check the equivalence point's volume and concentration again.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has reacted. The volume of NaOH added is 10 cm³. So total solution volume is 40 + 10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001 /0.05= 0.02 M. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recheck Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10. Correct.

So using Kb=5.405e-10, and [A^-]=0.02 M. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=3.288e-6. pOH is log(3.288e-6), but wait:

Wait, the [OH^-] is 3.288e-6. So pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let's compute it correctly.

3.288e-6 → log(3.288) is approximately 0.517, so 0.517 -6 → pOH is 5.483. So pH is 14-5.483=8.517, which rounds to 8.52. So yes, the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, that's option A.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when doing dilution, the concentration calculations can be tricky. Did I account for all the volumes correctly?

Wait, for the 25% titration point, the total volume is 40 cm³ (initial solution) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) =42.5 cm³. So the concentrations of HA and A^- are 0.00075/0.0425 and 0.00025/0.0425, which is correct.

Wait, another small thing: sometimes, when mixing two solutions, one is being added, so the total volume is the sum. That's what I did. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me see the options again. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first part. Maybe the initial moles are different?

Wait, let me double-check the initial moles.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³. So 0.001 mol in 0.04 L → 0.025 M.

NaOH used at 25% titration: 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. Moles NaOH: 0.1 *0.0025 L= 0.00025 mol.

So moles of HA: 0.001 - 0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of A^-:0.00025.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425= approx 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^-:0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

So ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253. So 4.25, which is approximately 4.26 as in option A.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should write the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly. Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). So that's correct.

Another way to calculate pH at 25% titration is to determine the concentration of H+ ions. Let me consider that approach.

The solution is a buffer, so the H+ concentration can be found using Ka.

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA]. So [H+] = Ka * [HA]/[A^-].

Wait, no, wait: [H+] = Ka * [HA]/[A^-].

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct equation is [H+] = Ka * ( [HA] / [A^-] ).

Wait, no, Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

So [A^-]/[HA] = 1/3 → pH = pKa + log(1/3) → same as before. So yes, same result.

So the calculations are correct. Therefore, the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Part 1: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The total moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) is \(3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralization reactions, and pH calculations involve the use of acid-base equilibria.

Alright, let's break it down. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, after dilution, the concentration changes. Wait, how do I calculate the new concentration?

Oh right, molarity is moles divided by volume. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. So when I titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, they'll react in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Next, the titration. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let me handle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH needed would equal the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 mol. So, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

But wait, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, when 25% of this is added, that's 2.5 cm³. But wait, the first part is 25% titration, which would mean that 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me think again. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So up to that point, the NaOH used is 10 cm³. For 25% titration, it's 25% of this volume, so 2.5 cm³. Alternatively, the mole ratio: 25% of the required NaOH is used.

Wait, but when calculating the pH at 25% titration, I need to find the pH before the equivalence point. For such cases, it's a buffer solution.

So, let's approach each part.

First, at 25% titration. The amount of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added. 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. The concentration is 0.1 M, so moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

The reaction of NaOH with acetic acid will convert some of the acetic acid into acetate ions. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- produced = 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

The concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which is about 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So around 4.26.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the ratio and the log.

[acetate] is 0.00025 mol in 0.0425 L → 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

[acetic acid] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.4771. So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529. So approximately 4.25. So the option with 4.26 is option A. But option D has 4.57. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait another thing. Wait, maybe the initial concentration after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me double-check.

Original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ water → total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, but wait—another approach. Alternatively, since both volumes are same, the dilution is 1/2. So the concentration is halved. So 0.05/2 = 0.025 M.

So first part: 25% titration. So 25% of the NaOH needed has been added. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.00025 mol of OH-.

So moles of acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Acetate: 0.00025. So the ratio is 1:3. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 1/3.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So about 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26 which is close. So maybe the first part is 4.26, but wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So the first part is 4.26 in option A. But according to my calculation, that's correct.

Now, the second part: equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic. So acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate will be calculated as follows. Moles of acetate at equivalence: 0.001 mol (since all acetic acid is neutralized). The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) + NaOH volume (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the concentration of OH- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02. Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.5168, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832. pH is 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, the pH is around 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches.

Wait, but wait. The initial calculation gives the pH at equivalence as 8.52, but I thought that for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence pH is determined by the Kb of the conjugate base. So the calculation seems correct.

So the two values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the calculations.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscalculated the volume at equivalence. Let me check the equivalence point's volume and concentration again.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has reacted. The volume of NaOH added is 10 cm³. So total solution volume is 40 + 10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001 /0.05= 0.02 M. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recheck Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10. Correct.

So using Kb=5.405e-10, and [A^-]=0.02 M. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=3.288e-6. pOH is log(3.288e-6), but wait:

Wait, the [OH^-] is 3.288e-6. So pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let's compute it correctly.

3.288e-6 → log(3.288) is approximately 0.517, so 0.517 -6 → pOH is 5.483. So pH is 14-5.483=8.517, which rounds to 8.52. So yes, the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, that's option A.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when doing dilution, the concentration calculations can be tricky. Did I account for all the volumes correctly?

Wait, for the 25% titration point, the total volume is 40 cm³ (initial solution) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) =42.5 cm³. So the concentrations of HA and A^- are 0.00075/0.0425 and 0.00025/0.0425, which is correct.

Wait, another small thing: sometimes, when mixing two solutions, one is being added, so the total volume is the sum. That's what I did. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me see the options again. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first part. Maybe the initial moles are different?

Wait, let me double-check the initial moles.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³. So 0.001 mol in 0.04 L → 0.025 M.

NaOH used at 25% titration: 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. Moles NaOH: 0.1 *0.0025 L= 0.00025 mol.

So moles of HA: 0.001 - 0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of A^-:0.00025.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425= approx 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^-:0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

So ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253. So 4.25, which is approximately 4.26 as in option A.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should write the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly. Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). So that's correct.

Another way to calculate pH at 25% titration is to determine the concentration of H+ ions. Let me consider that approach.

The solution is a buffer, so the H+ concentration can be found using Ka.

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA]. So [H+] = Ka * [HA]/[A^-].

Wait, no, wait: [H+] = Ka * [HA]/[A^-].

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct equation is [H+] = Ka * ( [HA] / [A^-] ).

Wait, no, Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

So [A^-]/[HA] = 1/3 → pH = pKa + log(1/3) → same as before. So yes, same result.

So the calculations are correct. Therefore, the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Part 1: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The total moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) is \(3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.52.
\]
