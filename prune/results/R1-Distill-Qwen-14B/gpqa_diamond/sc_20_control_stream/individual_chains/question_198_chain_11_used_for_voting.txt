Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let's denote the complexes as Co(SCN)_n^2−n.

Wait, so the complexes are:

- Co(SCN)1^+ (n=1)
- Co(SCN)2^0 (n=2)
- Co(SCN)3^− (n=3)
- Co(SCN)4^2− (n=4)

Wait, but the β values are given as β1 to β4. So β1 is the stability constant for the first complex, which is the one where one SCN ligand binds, right? So each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, actually, the formation constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each complex, the βn is the equilibrium constant for:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}.

Wait, no. I think the general formula is that βn is the equilibrium constant for:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}.

Wait, but sometimes the complexes can have different charges. So the first complex would be Co(SCN), which would have a charge of 2+ - n*(−1) since SCN^- is a −1 charge. So for n=1, Co(SCN)^+ (charge 2+ -1 = +1?), right?

Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is −1. So when one SCN binds to Co^2+:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+.

So the charge is +1 for the first complex. Similarly, for n=2:

Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^0.

n=3: Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3^-.

n=4: Co^2+ +4 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4^{2-}.

So the β values given are for each of these complexes.

Now, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex is the one with two SCN ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex. So the question is asking for the fraction of Co in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0.

Wait, but wait, the options are about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think in cobalt chemistry, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue complex, and [Co(SCN)_3]^- is the green one. So the question is about the percentage of the blue complex among all cobalt species.

So the first step is to calculate the concentration of each complex and find which one is the blue one, then find its percentage.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, but some of it is bound into complexes. The free Co^2+ would be the sum of all the complexes and the free ions.

Wait, no. The total Co concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} } = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Wait, but the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. So [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but some is bound into complexes. So the total SCN is [SCN^-] + (sum over each complex's n * [complex]) = 0.1 M.

But wait, the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. So that's the total SCN- concentration? Or is that the free SCN- concentration?

Wait, the problem states that the [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M. So I think that refers to the total concentration of free SCN- plus that bound in complexes. So, the sum [SCN^-] + sum (n * [Co(SCN)_n]) = 0.1 M. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps [SCN^-] is the concentration of free SCN- ions. I think it's more likely that [SCN^-] is the free concentration, but I'm not entirely certain. But the problem states "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M"—that usually refers to the total concentration. Wait, no, because when ligands are bound into complexes, they're not free. So maybe [SCN^-] is the free concentration. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the total thiocyanate would be the sum of free SCN- and all the bound SCN- in the complexes. So in the solution, the sum would be [SCN^-] (free) + [CoSCN^+] + 2[Co(SCN)_2^0] + 3[Co(SCN)_3^-] +4[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = 0.1 M.

Wait, but the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So perhaps [SCN^-] is the total concentration. But that can complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps [SCN^-] is the free concentration, and the complexes are formed from that.

Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased, I think [SCN^-] is the total concentration, which includes both free and bound. So the total thiocyanate is 0.1 M.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The problem says, "the [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M." That is, the concentration of SCN^- in solution is 0.1 M. So that would be the free SCN^- plus the bound in complexes. Because if it were the free concentration, it would have to specify, like [SCN^-]_free = 0.1 M. So I think [SCN^-] is the total, which is the sum of free and bound.

But that complicates the problem because the total Co and total SCN are given. So, the total Co is 0.01 M, and the total SCN is 0.1 M.

Hmm, but maybe I can set up a system of equations to model the concentrations.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to assume that the total SCN is 0.1 M, so [SCN]_total = [SCN^-] + sum (n * [Co(SCN)_n] ) = 0.1 M.

But this might get complicated, as we have multiple variables. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the majority of the SCN^- is free, so the [SCN^-] is approx 0.1 M, but that's probably not the case because the formation constants are in the range of 9 to 63, which suggests significant complexation.

Wait, the formation constants (beta) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, for each complex, the higher the beta, the more stable it is. So for each n, the beta is as follows:

n=1: β1 =9

n=2: β2=40

n=3: β3=63

n=4: β4=16

Wait, that's interesting. So the β increases from n=1 to n=3, and then drops for n=4. So the most stable complex is Co(SCN)_3^- with β=63.

So, the complexes are formed in order of n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4, but the β for n=4 is lower than n=3, which suggests that the Co(SCN)_3^- is the dominant species, followed by Co(SCN)_4^2−, but since β3 is the highest, perhaps the majority of Co is in the n=3 complex.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex (dithiocyanato is two SCN ligands).

So, to find the percentage of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2^0] form, I need to find [Co(SCN)_2^0] / [Co_total] × 100%.

So, the approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex and the free Co^2+.

But how?

I remember that for such systems, we can model the distribution of the metal between its various complexes as a function of the ligand concentration and the stability constants. 

The general approach is to write the equilibrium expressions for each complex, and then calculate the fraction of Co in each species.

But with four complexes, this could get quite involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that one of the species dominates, but given the β values, that might not be the case. For instance, if β3 is the highest, then perhaps Co(SCN)_3^- is the major species.

Wait, but let's think about the formation of each complex step by step.

The formation of each complex involves adding a ligand to the previous complex. So:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ (β1=9)

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0 (β2=40)

Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^- (β3=63)

Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2− (β4=16)

Each subsequent step has a stability constant for adding another SCN.

Wait, but the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Wait, no. Because each step is a separate equilibrium.

Wait, no. The overall β for the formation of Co(SCN)_4^2− would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. But wait, no, because each βn is the equilibrium for adding the nth ligand.

Wait, let me correct that. The overall β for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the stepwise βs up to n.

Wait, no. Each βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no. Because βn is the constant for the nth step. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_2^0] would have an overall β of β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^-] has β1 * β2 * β3 = 9 *40 *63 = 22680.

And [Co(SCN)_4^2−] has β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 9 *40*63*16 = let's see, 9*40 is 360, 360 *63 is 22680, 22680 *16 is 362880.

Wait, but wait, that's the overall β for each complex. So the overall β for each complex is the product of all the β up to that point.

So, the overall β values are:

β1 = 9 → for n=1.

β_total_2 = β1 * β2 = 9*40=360 → for n=2.

β_total_3= 9*40*63= 22680 → for n=3.

β_total_4= 9*40*63*16= 362880 → for n=4.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the highest β is for n=3, and then it decreases for n=4. So the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63, so the formation of the fourth ligand is less favored.

Wait, but this suggests that adding the fourth ligand is not as favored as the third. So the major species would be n=3, and possibly some n=4.

But wait, the problem is to find the percentage of n=2 (dithiocyanato, blue complex) relative to all Co species.

Hmm, but with such high β values, perhaps the majority of Co is in the highest β complex, which is n=3.

So let's consider that.

The approach is to calculate the fractional concentration of each Co species (free Co^2+, and each complex) based on the given conditions.

The general method is to use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal to find the fractional composition.

But given the presence of multiple complexes, this can get quite involved. One approach is to set up a system of equations, but maybe there's a shortcut.

Alternatively, I can use the method where the distribution of the metal into the various complexes is determined by considering the ratios of the formation constants.

Wait, perhaps I can model the situation by considering the fraction of each complex.

But let's think about the distribution of Co between the complexes.

The fraction f_n of Co in the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β_total_n * [SCN]^n) / ( β_total_0 [SCN]^0 + β_total_1 [SCN]^1 + β_total_2 [SCN]^2 + β_total_3 [SCN]^3 + β_total_4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, no. The correct expression is:

The fraction f_n is the concentration of the nth complex divided by the total concentration of Co.

The total Co is [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = c_Co = 0.01 M.

The expression for the nth complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_total_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

But because [Co^2+] is involved in all terms, perhaps we can express each [Co(SCN)_n] as β_total_n * [SCN^-]^n times [Co^2+].

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, let's consider that [Co^2+] is the same in all expressions, so perhaps we can let [Co^2+] = x.

Then,

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-]
[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2_total * x * [SCN^-]^2 → β_total_2 = β1 * β2 = 360.
[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β_total_3 * x * [SCN^-]^3 → 22680 x [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β_total_4 * x * [SCN^-]^4 → 362880 x [SCN]^4

Wait, but wait, no. Because each step involves adding a ligand, the actual β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the nth complex as being formed by adding n ligands, each with their own β.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β1 * β2 * β3 * ... * βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

So, for n=1: [CoSCN^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β1*β2 * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1*β2*β3 * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β1*β2*β3*β4 * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4

So, with that in mind, the total Co concentration is:

x + (β1 x [SCN]) + (β1β2 x [SCN]^2) + (β1β2β3 x [SCN]^3) + (β1β2β3β4 x [SCN]^4) ) = c_Co = 0.01 M.

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated because we have a quartic equation in [SCN]. But perhaps we can make some approximations.

Given that βn are relatively large, the higher n complexes may dominate, but the [SCN] is 0.1 M. Let me compute the terms to see which might be dominant.

Let me compute each term:

Given [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

n=0: x

n=1: β1 x [SCN] = 9 *x *0.1 = 0.9x

n=2: 9*40 *x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x *0.01= 3.6 x

n=3: 9*40*63 *x * (0.1)^3 = 22680 x *0.001= 22.68 x

n=4: 9*40*63*16 *x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001= 36.288 x

So sum all terms:

x + 0.9x + 3.6x + 22.68x +36.288x = (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) x = (64.868) x = 0.01 M.

So 64.868 x = 0.01 → x = 0.01 / 64.868 ≈ 1.541e-4 M.

So [Co^2+] = x ≈ 1.541e-4 M.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=1: 0.9x ≈ 0.9 * 1.541e-4 ≈ 1.387e-4 M.

n=2: 3.6 x ≈ 3.6 *1.541e-4 ≈ 5.547e-4 M.

n=3: 22.68 x ≈ 22.68 *1.541e-4 ≈ 3.499e-3 M.

n=4: 36.288 x ≈ 36.288 *1.541e-4 ≈ 5.583e-3 M.

Now, let's check the sum of all:

x ≈1.541e-4

n=1: 1.387e-4 → sum so far: 3.928e-4

n=2: 5.547e-4 → sum: 9.475e-4

n=3: 3.499e-3 → sum: 4.4467e-3

n=4: 5.583e-3 → sum: 1.003e-2 M.

Which is about 0.01003 M, which is close to the given 0.01 M, so our approximation seems okay.

Now, the question is: what is the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] is 5.547e-4 M.

Total Co concentration is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (5.547e-4 / 0.01) *100% = 5.547% → but wait, that's only 5.5%, which isn't among the options. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps my approach has a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_Co.

So for n=2, it's 5.547e-4 / 0.01 = 0.05547 → 5.547% → but the options are all higher than that. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should include the total thiocyanate concentration in the calculation. I might have missed that.

Because the approach I took only considered the Co species distribution, but the total SCN- is given as 0.1 M, which includes both free and bound. So perhaps I should also calculate the free [SCN^-], because in my earlier calculation, I used [SCN] =0.1 M, but that's the total. So in reality, [SCN^-]_free = 0.1 M minus the sum of all bound SCN.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because when we calculate the [SCN], I assumed it's the free concentration, but in reality, the total SCN is 0.1 M, which includes the free and the bound in the complexes.

So I think I made a mistake by taking [SCN] =0.1 M as the free concentration. It should instead be the total, but the equations should account for the fact that some SCN is bound in the complexes.

This changes the approach.

So let's correct that.

Let me denote [SCN^-]_free as S.

Total SCN is S + sum (n * [Co(SCN)_n] ) = 0.1 M.

But [Co(SCN)_n] is given by the product of the β_total_n and [Co^2+] * (S)^n.

Wait, that's a bit more involved. Let me try to set up the equations.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then, [CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * S

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β1 β2 x S²

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x S³

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4

Total Co: x + β1 x S + β1 β2 x S^2 + β1 β2 β3 x S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4 = 0.01 → Equation 1.

Total SCN: S + [CoSCN^+] + 2*[Co(SCN)_2^0] +3*[Co(SCN)_3^-] +4*[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = 0.1 → Equation 2.

So, substituting the expressions into Equation 2:

S + (β1 x S) + 2*(β1 β2 x S^2) + 3*(β1 β2 β3 x S^3) +4*(β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4) ) = 0.1 → Equation 2.

Now, this seems like a system of two equations with two variables (x and S). Solving this system would give us the values of x and S.

But this looks quite complicated. Maybe we can make some approximations.

First, perhaps the majority of Co is in the highest β complex, which is n=3. So let's see if the terms involving n=3 and n=4 are much larger than the others.

Let me compute the terms in Equation 1.

Assuming S is 0.1 (but this is an approximation), let's compute each term.

Term n=0: x

n=1: β1 x S → 9 x *0.1 = 0.9x

n=2: 360 x *0.01 = 3.6x

n=3: 22680 x *0.001 =22.68 x

n=4: 362880 x *0.0001 =36.288 x

So sum: x (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 )= 64.868 x = 0.01 → x≈1.54e-4 M.

Now, compute the total SCN using Equation 2.

SCN_total = S + (β1 x S) + 2*(β1 β2 x S^2) + 3*(β1 β2 β3 x S^3) +4*(β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

S + (9 * 1.54e-4 * S ) + 2*(360 *1.54e-4 * S²) + 3*(22680 *1.54e-4 * S^3 ) +4*(362880 *1.54e-4 * S^4 )

Simplify each term:

Term 1: S

Term 2: 9 *1.54e-4 * S = 1.386e-3 S

Term3: 2 *360 *1.54e-4 * S² → 2*360=720 → 720 *1.54e-4= 0.11088 → 0.11088 S²

Term4: 3 *22680 *1.54e-4 = 3*22680=68040 → 68040 *1.54e-4 ≈10.47 → 10.47 S^3

Term5:4 *362880 *1.54e-4 =4*362880=1,451,520 → 1,451,520 *1.54e-4 ≈223.8 → 223.8 S^4

So equation 2 becomes:

S + 1.386e-3 S + 0.11088 S² +10.47 S^3 +223.8 S^4 = 0.1

But wait, but we are assuming S is 0.1 M. Let's test S=0.1:

Compute each term:

Term1: 0.1

Term2: 1.386e-3 *0.1 = 0.0001386

Term3: 0.11088 * (0.1)^2 =0.11088 *0.01=0.0011088

Term4:10.47 * (0.1)^3 =10.47 *0.001=0.01047

Term5:223.8 * (0.1)^4 =223.8 *0.0001=0.02238

Adding all terms:

0.1 +0.0001386 ≈0.1001386

+0.0011088 → 0.1012474

+0.01047 →0.1117174

+0.02238 →0.1340974

Which is much less than 0.1. So 0.134 ≈0.134 M, which is higher than 0.1 M. So our assumption that S=0.1 is incorrect. Because the actual total SCN is 0.1, and our calculation gives 0.134, which is higher than 0.1, meaning that S must be less than 0.1.

So perhaps S is less than 0.1. Let's try S=0.08.

Compute each term:

Term1: 0.08

Term2: 1.386e-3 *0.08 = 0.0001109

Term3: 0.11088 * (0.08)^2 = 0.11088 *0.0064=0.000711

Term4:10.47 * (0.08)^3 =10.47 * 0.000512 ≈0.00536

Term5:223.8 * (0.08)^4 =223.8 *0.0004096≈0.0915

Sum: 0.08 +0.0001109=0.0801109

+0.000711 →0.0808219

+0.00536 →0.0861819

+0.0915 →0.1776819

That's way over 0.1. Hmm, that's not working. So perhaps S is between 0.05 and 0.08.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe an iterative approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the free [SCN^-], assuming it's negligible compared to the total. But given the high β values, perhaps the majority of SCN is bound into complexes, so S is much smaller than 0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the distribution using the conditional formation constants, considering the free ligand concentration.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each Co species based on the β values and the [SCN] =0.1 M.

But this is getting complicated for a multiple-choice question. Perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the β values.

Looking at the β values, the highest is β3=63, followed by β2=40, β1=9, and β4=16.

Wait, no, β3 is highest, but β4 is 16 which is less than β2.

Wait, but the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs.

So, [Co(SCN)_3^-] has β_total_3=9*40*63=22680.

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] has β_total_4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but that can't be right because adding a ligand with β4=16 would make the product higher. So the β_total_4 is higher than β_total_3.

Wait, wait, no. β_total_3 is 9*40*63=22680.

β_total_4 is 22680 *16 = 362880.

So the β_total increases with each step, which means each higher complex is more stable than the previous.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem gives β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. But when you multiply all stepwise βs, the overall β for n=4 is larger than for n=3.

So, perhaps the β_total for n=4 is 362,880, which is much higher than n=3's 22,680. So the largest β is for n=4, which would imply that the most Co is in the n=4 complex.

Wait, but that can't be right because β4 is a lower stepwise constant than β3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the stepwise β4 is for adding the fourth ligand. So for n=4, the step is Co^3− (n=3) + SCN^- → Co^4− (n=4), with β4=16.

So the β_total for n=4 is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 = 362,880.

So, the β_total increases with each step, making higher n complexes more stable.

But wait, the problem states β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. So the step of adding the fourth ligand is less favored than the third.

But the overall β for n=4 is higher than n=3, which means that the n=4 complex is more stable than n=3. So the majority of Co would be in the n=4 complex.

Wait, but that can't be right because the stepwise β4 is lower than β3. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should think about the distribution in terms of the fraction of each complex.

The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_total_n * [SCN]^n ) / (sum over m (β_total_m * [SCN]^m ) )

Where m runs from 0 to 4. But wait, β_total_0 is 1 (since it's the free Co^2+).

So, the denominator is the sum of β_total_m * [SCN]^m for m=0 to 4.

So, let's compute each term.

Given [SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute β_total_0 * [SCN]^0 =1*1=1.

m=1: β_total_1=9 → 9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

m=2: β_total_2=360 → 360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: β_total_3=22680 →22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: β_total_4=362880 →362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, denominator D = 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's compute:

1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction f_n for each n:

f_0 = 1 /64.468 ≈0.0155 → 1.55%.

f_1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396 →1.396%.

f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556 →5.556%.

f_3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518 →35.18%.

f_4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629 →56.29%.

So, the total of all f_n is 1.55 +1.396 +5.556 +35.18 +56.29 ≈100% (approx 100.076%). That's close enough.

So the fractions are approximately:

n=0: ~1.55%

n=1: ~1.40%

n=2: ~5.56%

n=3: ~35.18%

n=4: ~56.29%

So the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is about 5.56%. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) 16.9%, which is much higher than this.

Hmm, that's a problem because according to this calculation, the answer is about 5.5%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a minute. I think I messed up the calculation of the β_total_4. Let me recheck.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So β_total_4 =9 *40 *63 *16.

Compute step by step:

9 *40 =360.

360 *63 =22680.

22680 *16 =362880. So that's correct.

Wait, but no, because for the stepwise β4, it's the fourth ligand. So the β_total_4 is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 =9*40*63*16=362880.

So that part is correct.

But according to the fractions calculated, [Co(SCN)_2^0] is about 5.56%, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: the stability constants provided are the formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise constants.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants given are for each complex, not the stepwise. So, for example, β1 is the overall constant for CoSCN^+, β2 is the overall for Co(SCN)_2^0, etc.

In that case, the stepwise βs would be different.

Wait, if the given βn are the overall β_total_n for each complex, then the stepwise βs would be:

β1 = β_total_1 =9.

β2 = β_total_2 / β_total_1 = 40 /9 ≈4.444.

β3 = β_total_3 / β_total_2 =63/40=1.575.

β4= β_total_4 / β_total_3 =16/63≈0.2539.

Wait, but that would make the stepwise β4 much smaller than 1, which doesn't make sense because adding a ligand with a β less than 1 would not be favored. Hmm, perhaps this is the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βn are the stepwise constants, and the overall β for each complex is the product up to that point.

But I'm not sure. Let me try this approach.

Assuming the given βn are the stepwise constants, then the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

So, for n=1: β_total_1=9.

n=2: β_total_2=9 *40=360.

n=3: 9*40*63=22680.

n=4: 9*40*63*16=362880.

But that brings us back to the same fractions as before, where n=4 has the highest fraction.

But the calculation suggests that the blue complex (n=2) is about 5.56%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βn are the overall β for each complex, not the stepwise.

Wait, if that's the case, then the stepwise βs would be:

β1=β_total_1 / β_total_0 (assuming β_total_0=1) → β1=9/1=9.

β2=β_total_2/β_total_1= (β2 overall)/(β1 overall) → but we don't have that info.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) relative to all species, including those with higher n. But according to our previous calculation, it's about 5.56%, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the higher complexes beyond n=2. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Let me recompute the fractions.

Denominator D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468.

So f_2=3.6 /64.468 = 0.0555555... which is 5.5555...%.

But none of the options are close to this. The options are 42%, 25%, 38%, 16.9%.

Hmm, perhaps the problem considers only up to n=3, not n=4.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the n=4 complex. Let me try that.

So D would be 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68=28.18.

f_2=3.6 /28.18≈0.1277 →12.77%.

Still, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the β4 is negligible, so we can ignore n=4.

But according to our earlier calculation, f_4 is about 56%, which is a significant fraction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think of another way.

Another approach is to use the formula for the fraction of the nth complex:

f_n = β_total_n [SCN]^n / ( sum from m=0 to 4 β_total_m [SCN]^m )

Which is what I did earlier.

But the problem is that according to this, the blue complex (n=2) has only about 5.5% of the Co, which isn't an option.

So, perhaps the issue is that the total SCN includes the free and bound, and in my earlier approach, I assumed [SCN]=0.1 M as the free concentration, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps instead, the correct approach is to consider that the free SCN concentration is much lower because a lot is bound in complexes. So the [SCN] in the fraction calculations is actually the free [SCN], which is much less than 0.1 M.

So, the problem states that the total [SCN] is 0.1 M, which includes free and bound. So in this case, the free [SCN] (S) is much less than 0.1 M.

So, let's model it correctly.

Let me denote S as the free [SCN^-] concentration.

Total SCN: S + [CoSCN^+] + 2[Co(SCN)_2^0] +3[Co(SCN)_3^-] +4[Co(SCN)_4^2−] =0.1.

But [CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] S → since β1=9.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β1 β2 [Co^2+] S^2 =9*40 [Co^2+] S^2=360 [Co^2+] S^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] =9*40*63 [Co^2+] S^3=22680 [Co^2+] S^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^2−]=9*40*63*16 [Co^2+] S^4=362880 [Co^2+] S^4.

Total Co concentration:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+] S + β1 β2 [Co^2+] S^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+] S^4 =0.01.

Let me factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] * [1 +9 S + 360 S^2 +22680 S^3 +362880 S^4 ] =0.01.

Now, the equation for total SCN:

S +9 [Co^2+] S + 2*(360 [Co^2+] S^2) +3*(22680 [Co^2+] S^3) +4*(362880 [Co^2+] S^4 )=0.1.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

So,

Equation 1: x * (1 +9 S + 360 S^2 +22680 S^3 +362880 S^4 ) =0.01.

Equation 2: S +9 x S +720 x S^2 +68040 x S^3 +1,451,520 x S^4 =0.1.

This is a system of two equations with two variables x and S.

But solving this system is quite involved. Perhaps we can make an assumption to approximate S.

Assume that the majority of SCN is bound in complexes, so S is small. Let's say S is much less than 0.1 M.

Let me try to approximate by considering that the majority of SCN is in the highest complex, which is n=4.

So, in Equation 2, the dominant term is 1,451,520 x S^4, as it has the highest coefficient.

So,

1,451,520 x S^4 ≈0.1.

But from Equation 1, x = 0.01 / (1 + ... ). Since S is small, the denominator in Equation 1 is approximately 1, so x ≈0.01.

Substituting x≈0.01 into Equation 2's approximation:

1,451,520 *0.01 * S^4 ≈0.1 → 14,515.2 S^4 ≈0.1 → S^4 ≈0.1 /14515.2 → ≈6.88e-6 → S ≈ (6.88e-6)^(1/4).

Calculate (6.88e-6)^(1/4):

Let me compute ln(6.88e-6) ≈ ln(6.88) + ln(1e-6) → ln(6.88) ≈1.93, ln(1e-6)= -13.8155 → total≈-11.8855.

Divide by 4 →≈-2.9714.

Exponentiate → e^(-2.9714) ≈0.0516 M.

So S≈0.0516 M.

Now, plug S=0.0516 into Equation 1.

Denominator in Equation 1:

1 +9*(0.0516) +360*(0.0516)^2 +22680*(0.0516)^3 +362880*(0.0516)^4.

Compute each term:

9*0.0516≈0.4644.

360*(0.0516)^2 →0.0516^2=0.002663 →360 *0.002663≈0.9587.

22680*(0.0516)^3 →0.0516^3≈0.0001366 →22680 *0.0001366≈3.097.

362880*(0.0516)^4 →0.0516^4≈0.00000703 →362880 *0.00000703≈2.552.

So denominator ≈1 +0.4644=1.4644 → +0.9587=2.4231 →+3.097=5.5201 →+2.552≈8.072.

So x= 0.01 /8.072 ≈0.001239 M.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=1: β1 x S=9 *0.001239 *0.0516≈0.0000597 M.

n=2: β2 x S^2=360 *0.001239 * (0.0516)^2 →0.0516^2=0.002663 →360 *0.001239=0.445 → 0.445 *0.002663≈0.001184 M.

n=3: β3 x S^3=22680 *0.001239 * (0.0516)^3 → (0.0516)^3=0.0001366 →22680 *0.001239=28.08 →28.08 *0.0001366≈0.00384 M.

n=4: β4 x S^4=362880 *0.001239 * (0.0516)^4 → (0.0516)^4≈7.03e-6 →362880 *0.001239≈448.0 →448.0 *7.03e-6≈0.00315 M.

Now, compute the total Co:

x=0.001239 →0.001239 M.

n=1: 0.0000597 M.

n=2:0.001184 M.

n=3:0.00384 M.

n=4:0.00315 M.

Sum: 0.001239 +0.0000597=0.0012987 → +0.001184=0.0024827 → +0.00384=0.0063227 → +0.00315=0.0094727 M.

Which is less than 0.01 M. So our assumption may not be accurate enough. Perhaps we need to adjust S.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is needed. But this is getting too time-consuming.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the blue complex (n=2) has a fraction of approximately 5.5%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach was to assume that the free [SCN] is 0.1 M, leading to a fraction of about 5.5%, but perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the stability constants as the overall β for each complex, not the stepwise. So, for example, β1=9 is the overall constant for CoSCN^+, β2=40 for Co(SCN)_2^0, etc.

In this case, the fractions are calculated as:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum (βm [SCN]^m ) )

Where m runs from 1 to 4 (since Co^2+ is m=0, but perhaps we ignore m=0 in this case).

Wait, but this would change the approach. Let me try.

So, β1=9 (n=1), β2=40 (n=2), β3=63 (n=3), β4=16 (n=4).

Each term is βn * [SCN]^n.

But [SCN] is 0.1 M, and we're to find the fraction for n=2.

So,

f_2 = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / [9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 ]

Compute each term:

9*0.1=0.9.

40*(0.01)=0.4.

63*(0.001)=0.063.

16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Denominator sum=0.9 +0.4=1.3 →+0.063=1.363 →+0.0016=1.3646.

f_2=0.4 /1.3646 ≈0.2923 →29.23%.

Hmm, that's 29.23%, which is close to option C) 38.1% and option A)42.3%. But not exactly matching.

But wait, perhaps the correct calculation should include the free Co^2+ in the denominator. Because the Co can also be in the free form.

Wait, if the denominator includes the free Co^2+ as well, then the denominator would be 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So f_2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

Ah! That's option D) 16.9%.

So perhaps this is the correct approach. Because the problem states that the stability constants are for the complexes, and the total Co includes the free ion.

So, by this method, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂⁰, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β) and the total cobalt concentration. The stability constants are provided as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, with [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**:  
   The fraction of cobalt in each complex is determined by the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]  
   where \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (free Co²⁺), and \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Calculate Each Term**:  
   - For \( n = 0 \):  
     \[
     \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
     \]
   - For \( n = 1 \):  
     \[
     \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \):  
     \[
     \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
     \]
   - For \( n = 3 \):  
     \[
     \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
     \]
   - For \( n = 4 \):  
     \[
     \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
     \]

3. **Sum of All Terms**:  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of Co(SCN)₂⁰**:  
   The fraction of the blue complex (n = 2) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt species in the solution is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

ANSWER: D
