Okay, so I've got this physics problem about partition functions, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. Hmm. The question is about three spins, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because each state contributes exp(-βE) to Z. So first, I need to figure out all possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all.

But wait, maybe it's easier to categorize the states based on the number of aligned spins or something like that. Alternatively, since the energy depends on the products of the spins, perhaps I can find how many states have a certain value of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think. Each S_i can be ±1, so the product S_i S_j will be +1 if they are the same and -1 if different. So S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can each be +1 or -1.

But the energy is E = -J [ sum of these products ].

So let me think about possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

What are the possible values of H?

Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute H for each possible state of the three spins.

Wait, the spins can be in any combination of up and down. Let me list all possible 8 states and compute H for each.

So the possible states are:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
H = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 +1+1=3

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
H = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
H = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
H = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 +1 +1 =3

Wait, so looking at these, state 1 and state 8 give H=3, and all the others have H=-1. So that's two states with H=3, and six states with H=-1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recount. For each state, how many have H=3?

Only two: all +1 and all -1. The others (6 states) have H=-1.

So the energy E for each state is E = -J * H.

So for H=3: E = -J*3 = -3J.

For H=-1: E = -J*(-1) = J.

Now, partition function Z = sum_{all states} exp( -β E )

Wait wait, no. The partition function is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ), where E is the energy of the state. So each state contributes exp( -β E ).

Wait, but since we have degeneracy for each E, maybe it's better to compute how many states have each E and sum accordingly.

So, two states have E = -3J, and six states have E = J.

So each of the two states contributes exp( -β*(-3J) ) = exp(3β J), and each of the six states contributes exp( -β*(J) ) = exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Looking at the options:

Option A) 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ}

Hmm, no because in our case, the 2 is multiplied by e^{3Jβ}.

Option B) 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → this matches what we have.

Option C) 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ} → no, coefficients and exponents differ.

Option D) 6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ} → no.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because when H =3, E=-3J.

So in the exponent for E, it's -β E. So for E=-3J, it's -β*(-3J) = 3 β J. So e^{3β J}.

And for E=+J, it's -β*J → e^{-β J}.

So yes, the correct partition function is 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the problem statement, the energy is E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3], which is -J H. So H is the sum, so E = -J H.

So when H is 3, E is -3J.

When H is -1, E is J.

So for each state with H=3, E=-3J, the term in Z is e^{β * 3J}.

For each state with H=-1, E=J, term is e^{-β J}.

So total Z is 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Which is option B.

To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy Levels**:  
   The energy depends on the sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). By evaluating \( H \) for all \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states of the spins, we find:  
   - Two states have \( H = 3 \) (all spins aligned, either \( +1, +1, +1 \) or \( -1, -1, -1 \)), corresponding to \( E = -3J \).  
   - Six states have \( H = -1 \) (one pair aligned and the third spin opposite), corresponding to \( E = J \).

2. **Partition Function**:  
   The partition function is given by \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).  
   - For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \exp(3\beta J) \).  
   - For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6 \exp(-\beta J) \).  
   Thus, \( Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J) \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options:  
   - **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3\beta J) + 6 \exp(\beta J) \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed).  
   - **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J) \) (correct, matches the derived expression).  
   - **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2\beta J) + 6 \exp(-2\beta J) \) (incorrect, as the exponents and coefficients are wrong).  
   - **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2\beta J) + 2 \exp(-2\beta J) \) (incorrect, as the exponents and coefficients are wrong).

Therefore, the correct partition function is \( Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J) \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
