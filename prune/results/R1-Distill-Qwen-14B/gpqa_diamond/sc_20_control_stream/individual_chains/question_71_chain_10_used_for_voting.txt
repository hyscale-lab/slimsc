Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. Hmm, TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I don't think that's directly relevant here. The main point is about their orbital periods and equilibrium temperatures.

The setup says there are five planets, all in orbital resonance with circular orbits. Their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has a period of, say, P. Then Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. But wait, I think the exact periods aren't given, just the ratios. Since all are in resonance, their periods are multiples of each other, but the exact value of P doesn't matter because we're looking for a ratio.

The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so that factor won't come into play. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

But since all planets are around the same star, R_star and T_star are constants. The albedo A is the same for both, so that term (1 - A)^(1/4) is the same for both Planet_2 and Planet_4. So when we take the ratio of their temperatures, that term will cancel out.

So the main factor is the distance 'a' from the star. Since the planets are in circular orbits, Kepler's third law applies. The formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, which can be rearranged to a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). But to compare distances, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of ratios.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with ratios, the formula for equilibrium temperature can be considered in terms of the square root of the period or the cube root of the distance. Wait, let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or is it the cube root? Hmm.

Wait, let me think. The period P is related to the semi-major axis 'a' by Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³. So P² = k a³, where k is a constant depending on the star's mass and other factors. So a³ = P² / k. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

But since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (because Te is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) ), let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Ah, so Te is inversely proportional to the square root of 'a'. So if a increases, Te decreases.

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), because a^3 = (P^2) * (other constants), then a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, substituting, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a) = 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3)) ) = 1 / ( P^(1/3) )

So Te is proportional to P^(-1/3). That is, Te ∝ P^(-1/3).

So the ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (T4 / T2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, because Te is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So T4 = T_star * (P4)^(-1/3), T2 = T_star * (P2)^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait no, wait: Let's redo that. If Te ∝ P^(-1/3), then T4 is proportional to (P4)^(-1/3), T2 is proportional to (P2)^(-1/3). So the ratio T4/T2 is (P4^(-1/3)) / (P2^(-1/3)) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct.

So the ratio is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

The periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5. So Planet_2 has a period of 2, Planet_4 has 3.5.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 is 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 (since 2 divided by 3.5 is same as 4/7, because 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7).

So (4/7)^(1/3 ) is the ratio T4/T2.

Wait, but wait, (4/7) is approximately 0.5714. So what's the cube root of 0.5714?

Let me calculate that. Cube root of 0.5714. Let me think: cube of 0.8 is 0.512. Cube of 0.83 is approx 0.83^3 = (0.8^3) + 3*(0.8)^2*0.03 + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3) ≈ 0.512 + 3*0.64*0.03≈ 0.512 + 0.0576 = 0.5696 . Hmm, that's close to 0.5714.

Wait, 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571787. Because 0.83*0.83=0.6889. 0.6889*0.83 ≈ 0.571787. So the cube of 0.83 is about 0.571787. Which is just a bit above 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714 would be just a bit less than 0.83.

Wait, but that's the cube root of 0.5714, which is 0.83 almost. Wait, but wait, don't I need to take cube root of (4/7), which is approximately 0.5714. So the cube root is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that more accurately.

4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.57142857.

Cube root of 0.57142857.

Let me see, 0.8^3 is 0.512.

0.82^3: 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724. 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ let's calculate 0.6724 * 0.8 = 0.53792, 0.6724 *0.02= 0.013448. So total is about 0.551368.

0.83^3: as before, 0.5718.

So 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571787.

So 0.5714 is slightly less than that, so the cube root is slightly less than 0.83. Let's approximate.

Let me compute the cube of 0.83 and 0.828.

At 0.83: 0.571787.

At 0.828: Let's compute (0.828)^3.

0.828 * 0.828 = let's compute that.

0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64.

0.8 * 0.028 = 0.0224.

0.028 * 0.8 = 0.0224.

0.028 * 0.028 = 0.000784.

Wait, that's probably not the best way. Let me compute 828 * 828 = ?

828 * 800 = 662400.

828 * 28 = 23184.

So 828^2 = 662400 + 23184 = 685,584.

So 828^3 = 828 * 685,584.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.828^3.

0.828 * 0.828 = (0.8 + 0.028)^2 = 0.64 + 2*(0.8)(0.028) + 0.028^2 = 0.64 + 0.0448 + 0.000784 ≈ 0.685584.

Then multiply by 0.828: 0.685584 * 0.828.

Let me compute 0.685584 * 0.8 = 0.5484672.

0.685584 * 0.028 = 0.019196352.

Adding them together: 0.5484672 + 0.019196352 = 0.567663552.

So (0.828)^3 ≈ 0.567663552.

But we have 4/7 ≈ 0.57142857, which is higher than 0.567663552. So the cube root of 0.5714 is between 0.828 and 0.83.

Let me find the exact value. Let me set x = cube root of 0.57142857.

We know that x^3 = 0.57142857.

Between 0.828 and 0.83, as established.

Let me compute 0.828 + delta.

At x=0.828, x^3≈0.567663552.

We need x^3 =0.57142857.

The difference is 0.57142857 - 0.567663552 = 0.003765018.

We can approximate the delta needed.

The derivative of x^3 is 3x². At x=0.828, dx is about delta, and delta ≈ (desired difference) / (3x²).

So desired difference is approximately 0.003765.

3x² at x=0.828 is 3*(0.828)^2 = 3*(0.685584) ≈ 2.056752.

So delta ≈ 0.003765 / 2.056752 ≈ approximately 0.00183.

So x ≈ 0.828 + 0.00183 = 0.82983.

So x ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but if at 0.828, x^3=0.56766, and we need 0.57143, which is about 0.00377 higher. So we can approximate that the cube root is about 0.828 + (0.00377 / (3*(0.828)^2)).

Alternatively, let's compute x=0.829.

Compute (0.829)^3.

0.829 * 0.829: Let's compute 0.8*0.8=0.64, 0.8*0.029=0.0232, 0.029*0.8=0.0232, 0.029 *0.029=0.000841.

So (0.8 + 0.029)^2 = 0.64 + 2*(0.0232) + 0.000841.

Which is 0.64 + 0.0464 + 0.000841 ≈ 0.687241.

Now multiply by 0.829:

0.687241 * 0.829.

Let me approximate this.

0.687241 * 0.8 = 0.5497928.

0.687241 * 0.029 = approx 0.019930.

Adding them gives approximately 0.5697228.

Which is very close to 0.57142857. So the cube of 0.829 is about 0.5697, which is still less than 0.5714. So perhaps x is a bit higher.

Let me try x=0.8295.

x=0.8295.

Compute (0.8295)^3.

But maybe it's easier to compute the difference.

At x=0.829, x^3 ≈ 0.5697228.

At x=0.8295, how much does x^3 increase?

The approximate change is 3*(0.829)^2 * delta_x.

delta_x is 0.0005.

3*(0.829)^2 =3*(0.687241) ≈2.061723.

So delta_x * 3x² ≈ 0.0005 *2.061723 ≈ 0.00103086.

So x^3 at 0.8295 is approximately 0.5697228 + 0.00103086 ≈ 0.5707536.

Which is still less than 0.57142857.

Now, the difference is 0.57142857 - 0.5707536 ≈ 0.000675.

So how much more delta_x do we need? Let's compute delta_x = 0.000675 / (3*(0.8295)^2).

3*(0.8295)^2 ≈3*(0.68823) ≈2.06469.

So delta_x ≈0.000675 / 2.06469 ≈ approximately 0.0003266.

So x ≈0.8295 + 0.0003266 ≈ 0.8298266.

So x is approximately 0.82983.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.8298.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.8298.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, option D is ~0.75, option B is ~0.69, option A is ~0.57.

So approximately 0.83 is option C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I get the ratio right? Because earlier I thought the ratio was (P2/P4)^(1/3). Oh, because T4 is proportional to P4^(-1/3), T2 is P2^(-1/3), so T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So (2/3.5) is 4/7, so (4/7)^(1/3) is the ratio.

Yes, so the ratio is 0.83.

So the answer is C) ~0.83.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( T_e \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, which scales as \( P^{2/3} \) (from Kepler's third law), and \( T_e \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we identify Planet_2 as having a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 as \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is therefore:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.83.**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. Hmm, TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I don't think that's directly relevant here. The main point is about their orbital periods and equilibrium temperatures.

The setup says there are five planets, all in orbital resonance with circular orbits. Their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has a period of, say, P. Then Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. But wait, I think the exact periods aren't given, just the ratios. Since all are in resonance, their periods are multiples of each other, but the exact value of P doesn't matter because we're looking for a ratio.

The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so that factor won't come into play. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

But since all planets are around the same star, R_star and T_star are constants. The albedo A is the same for both, so that term (1 - A)^(1/4) is the same for both Planet_2 and Planet_4. So when we take the ratio of their temperatures, that term will cancel out.

So the main factor is the distance 'a' from the star. Since the planets are in circular orbits, Kepler's third law applies. The formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, which can be rearranged to a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). But to compare distances, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of ratios.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with ratios, the formula for equilibrium temperature can be considered in terms of the square root of the period or the cube root of the distance. Wait, let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or is it the cube root? Hmm.

Wait, let me think. The period P is related to the semi-major axis 'a' by Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³. So P² = k a³, where k is a constant depending on the star's mass and other factors. So a³ = P² / k. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

But since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (because Te is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) ), let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Ah, so Te is inversely proportional to the square root of 'a'. So if a increases, Te decreases.

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), because a^3 = (P^2) * (other constants), then a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, substituting, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a) = 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3)) ) = 1 / ( P^(1/3) )

So Te is proportional to P^(-1/3). That is, Te ∝ P^(-1/3).

So the ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (T4 / T2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, because Te is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So T4 = T_star * (P4)^(-1/3), T2 = T_star * (P2)^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait no, wait: Let's redo that. If Te ∝ P^(-1/3), then T4 is proportional to (P4)^(-1/3), T2 is proportional to (P2)^(-1/3). So the ratio T4/T2 is (P4^(-1/3)) / (P2^(-1/3)) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct.

So the ratio is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

The periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5. So Planet_2 has a period of 2, Planet_4 has 3.5.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 is 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 (since 2 divided by 3.5 is same as 4/7, because 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7).

So (4/7)^(1/3 ) is the ratio T4/T2.

Wait, but wait, (4/7) is approximately 0.5714. So what's the cube root of 0.5714?

Let me calculate that. Cube root of 0.5714. Let me think: cube of 0.8 is 0.512. Cube of 0.83 is approx 0.83^3 = (0.8^3) + 3*(0.8)^2*0.03 + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3) ≈ 0.512 + 3*0.64*0.03≈ 0.512 + 0.0576 = 0.5696 . Hmm, that's close to 0.5714.

Wait, 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571787. Because 0.83*0.83=0.6889. 0.6889*0.83 ≈ 0.571787. So the cube of 0.83 is about 0.571787. Which is just a bit above 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714 would be just a bit less than 0.83.

Wait, but that's the cube root of 0.5714, which is 0.83 almost. Wait, but wait, don't I need to take cube root of (4/7), which is approximately 0.5714. So the cube root is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that more accurately.

4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.57142857.

Cube root of 0.57142857.

Let me see, 0.8^3 is 0.512.

0.82^3: 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724. 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ let's calculate 0.6724 * 0.8 = 0.53792, 0.6724 *0.02= 0.013448. So total is about 0.551368.

0.83^3: as before, 0.5718.

So 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571787.

So 0.5714 is slightly less than that, so the cube root is slightly less than 0.83. Let's approximate.

Let me compute the cube of 0.83 and 0.828.

At 0.83: 0.571787.

At 0.828: Let's compute (0.828)^3.

0.828 * 0.828 = let's compute that.

0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64.

0.8 * 0.028 = 0.0224.

0.028 * 0.8 = 0.0224.

0.028 * 0.028 = 0.000784.

Wait, that's probably not the best way. Let me compute 828 * 828 = ?

828 * 800 = 662400.

828 * 28 = 23184.

So 828^2 = 662400 + 23184 = 685,584.

So 828^3 = 828 * 685,584.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.828^3.

0.828 * 0.828 = (0.8 + 0.028)^2 = 0.64 + 2*(0.8)(0.028) + 0.028^2 = 0.64 + 0.0448 + 0.000784 ≈ 0.685584.

Then multiply by 0.828: 0.685584 * 0.828.

Let me compute 0.685584 * 0.8 = 0.5484672.

0.685584 * 0.028 = 0.019196352.

Adding them together: 0.5484672 + 0.019196352 = 0.567663552.

So (0.828)^3 ≈ 0.567663552.

But we have 4/7 ≈ 0.57142857, which is higher than 0.567663552. So the cube root of 0.5714 is between 0.828 and 0.83.

Let me find the exact value. Let me set x = cube root of 0.57142857.

We know that x^3 = 0.57142857.

Between 0.828 and 0.83, as established.

Let me compute 0.828 + delta.

At x=0.828, x^3≈0.567663552.

We need x^3 =0.57142857.

The difference is 0.57142857 - 0.567663552 = 0.003765018.

We can approximate the delta needed.

The derivative of x^3 is 3x². At x=0.828, dx is about delta, and delta ≈ (desired difference) / (3x²).

So desired difference is approximately 0.003765.

3x² at x=0.828 is 3*(0.828)^2 = 3*(0.685584) ≈ 2.056752.

So delta ≈ 0.003765 / 2.056752 ≈ approximately 0.00183.

So x ≈ 0.828 + 0.00183 = 0.82983.

So x ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but if at 0.828, x^3=0.56766, and we need 0.57143, which is about 0.00377 higher. So we can approximate that the cube root is about 0.828 + (0.00377 / (3*(0.828)^2)).

Alternatively, let's compute x=0.829.

Compute (0.829)^3.

0.829 * 0.829: Let's compute 0.8*0.8=0.64, 0.8*0.029=0.0232, 0.029*0.8=0.0232, 0.029 *0.029=0.000841.

So (0.8 + 0.029)^2 = 0.64 + 2*(0.0232) + 0.000841.

Which is 0.64 + 0.0464 + 0.000841 ≈ 0.687241.

Now multiply by 0.829:

0.687241 * 0.829.

Let me approximate this.

0.687241 * 0.8 = 0.5497928.

0.687241 * 0.029 = approx 0.019930.

Adding them gives approximately 0.5697228.

Which is very close to 0.57142857. So the cube of 0.829 is about 0.5697, which is still less than 0.5714. So perhaps x is a bit higher.

Let me try x=0.8295.

x=0.8295.

Compute (0.8295)^3.

But maybe it's easier to compute the difference.

At x=0.829, x^3 ≈ 0.5697228.

At x=0.8295, how much does x^3 increase?

The approximate change is 3*(0.829)^2 * delta_x.

delta_x is 0.0005.

3*(0.829)^2 =3*(0.687241) ≈2.061723.

So delta_x * 3x² ≈ 0.0005 *2.061723 ≈ 0.00103086.

So x^3 at 0.8295 is approximately 0.5697228 + 0.00103086 ≈ 0.5707536.

Which is still less than 0.57142857.

Now, the difference is 0.57142857 - 0.5707536 ≈ 0.000675.

So how much more delta_x do we need? Let's compute delta_x = 0.000675 / (3*(0.8295)^2).

3*(0.8295)^2 ≈3*(0.68823) ≈2.06469.

So delta_x ≈0.000675 / 2.06469 ≈ approximately 0.0003266.

So x ≈0.8295 + 0.0003266 ≈ 0.8298266.

So x is approximately 0.82983.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.8298.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.8298.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, option D is ~0.75, option B is ~0.69, option A is ~0.57.

So approximately 0.83 is option C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I get the ratio right? Because earlier I thought the ratio was (P2/P4)^(1/3). Oh, because T4 is proportional to P4^(-1/3), T2 is P2^(-1/3), so T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So (2/3.5) is 4/7, so (4/7)^(1/3) is the ratio.

Yes, so the ratio is 0.83.

So the answer is C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( T_e \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, which scales as \( P^{2/3} \) (from Kepler's third law), and \( T_e \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we identify Planet_2 as having a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 as \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is therefore:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.83.**
