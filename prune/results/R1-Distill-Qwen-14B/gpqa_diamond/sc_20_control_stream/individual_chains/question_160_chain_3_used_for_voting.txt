Okay, so I have this physics problem about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. The options are given, and I need to figure out the right answer.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about diffraction patterns. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of maxima and minima. The exact pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the minima occur at angles θ where d sinθ = mλ, with m being an integer. But wait, that's for a single slit. What about other shapes?

Oh, right. The problem says the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon. When N becomes infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So, for N approaching infinity, the aperture is a circular one.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The apothem is given as 'a' for all sides. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N). But as N becomes very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the apothem would approach the radius. So in the limit, a ≈ R, because for large N, cos(π/N) approaches 1.

So, when N is infinitely large, the aperture is a circle with radius a. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Now, I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by dark rings. The minima (dark rings) occur at specific angles determined by the Bessel function zeros. The first minimum is the first dark ring, then the next, etc.

The formula for the angular position of the minima in a circular aperture is given by θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. For the first minimum (m=1), x_1 is approximately 3.8317. Wait, no—wait, no, wait. Wait, the minima in the far field for a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the derivative of the Bessel function J1. The first dark ring is at θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The condition for minima in the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum occurs when J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is the wave number (2π/λ). The zeros of J1 are at x = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first minimum is at x1=3.8317, the second at x2=7.0156.

Wait, actually, I think the formula is sinθ = x_m * λ/(π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for the first minimum (m=1), sinθ1 = x1 * λ/(π a). Similarly, for the second minimum (m=2), sinθ2 = x2 * λ/(π a).

But wait, the question says to assume that the angles are small, so we can use tanθ ≈ θ, which is approximately θ in radians. Because for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ and tanθ ≈ θ. So perhaps we can approximate θ ≈ sinθ.

So, the angular separation between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1. Let me compute that.

θ1 ≈ (x1 * λ) / (π a)
θ2 ≈ (x2 * λ) / (π a)
Δθ = θ2 - θ1 = (x2 - x1) * λ / (π a)

The values of x1 and x2 are 3.8317 and 7.0156, respectively. So x2 - x1 = 7.0156 -3.8317 = 3.1839.

So Δθ ≈ (3.1839) * λ / (π a)

Let me compute that numerically. 3.1839 divided by π is approximately 3.1839 / 3.1416 ≈ 1.013.

So Δθ ≈ 1.013 * λ/(a). Wait, but wait—looking at the options, none of them have a factor as high as 1.013. The options are around 0.5 or 0.6.

Wait, maybe I messed up with the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait! The formula for the minima in the single-slit is for the intensity minima, which occurs when (a sinθ) = m λ, but that's for a single slit. For a circular aperture, it's different because the pattern is two-dimensional, but when considering the far-field, the minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering a multi-slit scenario? Or perhaps it's a question about the diffraction pattern of a polygon that becomes a circle, but evaluated in the far field as a grating?

No, wait, the problem states that N is infinitely large, so the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture, which is the Airy pattern.

Now, the angular separation between the first two minima in the Airy pattern. The first minimum is at about θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(π a), because x1 is approximately 3.8317, which is approximately π * 1.22 (since π is about 3.1416, 3.8317 / π ≈ 1.22). So θ1 ≈ (3.8317) * λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, wait, no, θ is in radians, right? So for the first minimum, θ1 = x1 λ / (π a) ≈ (3.8317) λ/(π a) ≈ (3.8317 / 3.1416) λ/(a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a. But wait, this is θ in radians. Because in the approximation, θ is small, so sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, but the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(a), the second at θ2 ≈ (7.0156) λ/(π a) ≈ (7.0156/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

Wait, no, wait, 7.0156 divided by π is approximately 2.234. So θ2 ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

But wait, the problem says to use the small angle approximation where tanθ = θ. Wait, but 1.22 λ/a and 2.234 λ/a are angles in radians. Are these considered small? Let's see. Let's plug a typical value. Suppose a is a millimeter, and λ is 500 nm. Then 1.22 * 500e-9 m / (1e-3 m) = 1.22e-3 radians, which is about 0.07 degrees, which is small. So the approximation holds.

So, the angular separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.234 - 1.22 ) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.014 (λ/a). So about 1.014 λ/a. But looking at the options, none of the choices are around 1.014.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ/a

Hmm. Option C is 1.220 λ/a. But that's the position of the first minimum, not the separation between the first two minima. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. The first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second is the next one. So their angular separation is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(π a) = (3.1839) * λ/(π a). 3.1839 / π ≈ 1.013, so 1.013 (λ/a), which isn't an option. But none of the options are close to 1.013.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think again. The problem says the apothems are all the same length a. For a regular polygon, the apothem is a = (s/2) / tan(π/N), where s is the side length. Alternatively, the radius R is a / cos(π/N) = a * sec(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, R approaches a, because π/N approaches 0, and cos approaches 1, so R=a.

Wait, but then the radius R of the circular aperture is a. So in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, the minima occur when a sinθ = x_m λ / π, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

So, for the first minimum, m=1: sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ) / (π a). So θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Similarly, m=2: sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ) / (π a) → θ2 ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

So the angular separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.234 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.014 λ/a.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, but perhaps the question is considering the diffraction pattern as a single slit of width 2a, perhaps?

Wait, no. The polygon's apothem is 'a'; for a polygon with N sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. When N is large, the polygon approaches a circle with radius R = a / cos(π/N) ≈ a + (π²)/(2 N a) and so on. But for N→infinite, R ≈ a. So the radius of the circular aperture is a.

Alternatively, perhaps the diameter is 2a? Wait, no. The apothem for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the side. For a polygon with side length s, apothem a, the radius R is a / cos(π/N). So when N is large, R ≈ a. Thus, the radius of the circular aperture is a.

Wait, but in the single-slit diffraction formula, the slit width is d, and the minima occur at d sinθ = mλ. But for a circular aperture, the situation is different. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to think of the polygon as a single slit with width 2a (since the apothem is a, so perhaps the side length is 2a?), but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between apothem and the radius. Let me clarify: 

In a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (R) is the distance from the center to a vertex. The relation between the two is R = a / cos(π/N). So, for a polygon with N sides, as N approaches infinity, R approaches a. So the circular aperture has radius R = a. So in the Fraunhofer pattern, the minima are determined by R sinθ = (x_m λ)/ (2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by sinθ = (x_m λ)/(π R), where x_m is the m-th root of J1. So the formula is sinθ = (x_m λ)/(π R).

Wait, I think I might have messed up the formula. Let me check my notes. The standard formula for the minima in the Airy disk is when R sinθ = (x_m λ)/(2π), where R is the radius of the aperture, and x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

Wait, no. Let me think. The intensity for a circular aperture is given by I(θ) = I_0 (J1( (π a sinθ)/λ ))^2 / ( (π a sinθ)/λ )^2. The minima occur when the argument of J1 is one of its zeros, which are x_m. So, (π a sinθ)/λ = x_m → sinθ = (x_m λ)/(π a). So the first minimum is at sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π a), and the second at sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a).

Wait, but wait, the argument for J1 is (k R sinθ), where k is 2π/λ, R is the radius. So (k R sinθ) = (2π/λ) R sinθ. So J1(k R sinθ) =0 → k R sinθ = x_m → sinθ = x_m λ/(2 π R). Hmm, that differs from what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me clarify the formula.

The correct condition for the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture is when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is equal to one of its zeros. The diffraction pattern is given by the intensity:

I(θ) = ( (J1( x ))^2 ) * ( 1 / x^2 ), where x = (π a sinθ) / λ.

Wait, another approach. The general formula for the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is I(θ) proportional to ( (J1( (π a sinθ)/λ )) / ( (π a sinθ)/(2λ) ) )^2, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe looking up the exact formula would help, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed carefully.

Wait, another approach. The Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture results in the intensity distribution known as the Airy pattern. The first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ / (π a), giving θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(a) (since for small angles, sinθ≈θ). So the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ/(a), and the second at θ2 = 2.234 λ/(a). The angular separation Δθ is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.234 - 1.22) (λ/a) ≈ 1.014 λ/a.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C, 1.220 λ/a, which is the position of the first minimum. There's no option for around 1.014. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but a different shape. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single slit scenario, but with the width of 2a.

Wait, if the polygon becomes a circle, but perhaps the problem is a single slit of width 'a' (since the apothem is a). Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a single slit, the width is 2a (since the apothem is the middle of the slit to the edge). So a single slit of width d=2a.

In single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at d sinθ = m λ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. So the first minima (m=1) are at θ1 = arcsin(λ/(2a)), and the second at θ2 = arcsin(2λ/(2a))= arcsin(λ/a). But wait, arcsin cannot have an argument greater than 1. So λ/a must be ≤1. So, θ1 = λ/(2a), θ2 = λ/a (assuming small angles, so sinθ ≈ θ). Then the angular separation between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 = (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a). So that's 0.5 λ/a. Which is option B.

But wait, the question says it's a polygon with N sides, but when N is infinitely large, it becomes a circle. So perhaps the problem is not a single slit, but a circular aperture. But in that case, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(a), but the separation between first and second is around 1.014 λ/a, which isn't an option.

Hmm, but the options include option C as 1.220 λ/a, which matches the position of the first minimum in the circular case. Option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is close to 0.5 λ/a. Wait, 0.506 is about (1/2) * 1.012, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a regular N-gon but not as a circle. Wait, but the question says N is infinitely large, so it becomes a circle.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the diffraction pattern as a rectangular aperture. No, the polygon's apothems are all the same, so it's a regular polygon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diffraction pattern of an aperture with a flat top, like a rectangular or square shape, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation for a single slit, but with the width being 2a, leading to the first minima at θ = λ/(2a), as in the single-slit case. Then the separation between first and second minima would be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But wait, why would the polygon become a single slit when N is large? No, that doesn't make sense. It becomes a circle.

But in the problem statement, the options don't have the 1.014 λ/a value, but option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is the position of the first minimum. So perhaps the problem is asking for the position of the first minimum, not the separation between the first two minima. But the question clearly states, 'the angular distance between the first two minima'.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the separation between the first two minima correctly.

For a circular aperture, the minima occur at θ where sinθ = x_m λ/(π R), with R being the radius.

Wait, when R is the radius, and a is the apothem, which for N approaching infinity, R ≈ a. So, sinθ = x_m λ/(π a).

So, the first minimum (m=1): sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) → θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Second minimum (m=2): sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) → θ2 ≈ (7.0156/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

The angular separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.234 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.014 λ/a.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the diffraction pattern.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a collection of N slits, each of width 2a, leading to a grating-like diffraction. But when N is large, the grating becomes a continuous aperture, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture, but that's not the case since all apothems are same.

Wait another approach: perhaps the angular separation is calculated using the first and second minima, considering the minima of the overall diffraction pattern, which might be similar to a single slit but with a width determined by the polygon's properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum of a circular aperture, which is 1.22 λ/a, but then the separation between the first and second minima is the difference between their positions. But again, that would be about 1.014 λ/a.

Hmm, but looking at the options, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express the problem.

The question states that the angular distance is between the first two minima. The first minimum is the first dark ring, then the second. The positions are θ1 and θ2, and the separation is θ2 - θ1.

If option C is 1.220 λ/a, that's θ1, not the separation. So the separation would be the next minimum minus the first. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's considering the polygon as a single slit whose width is 2a, which would mean the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(2a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/(2a) = λ/a. The angular separation would be λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But why would the polygon become a single slit with width 2a? That doesn't make sense. The polygon's apothem is a, but when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a, not a single slit of width 2a.

Wait, perhaps the problem is modeling the polygon as a slit with width 2a, assuming each side is a slit. But for a polygon, each side is a flat edge, so it's more like an array of slits, but when N is large, it's a continuous structure. Hmm, perhaps this is leading me astray.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a rectangular aperture. Wait, in the case of a rectangular aperture of width w and height h, the minima are determined by the product of the single-slit minima in each dimension. But for a square, it's more complicated. But perhaps in this case, the polygon is considered as a square, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a single slit, with width a, then the minima are at θ = m λ/a, so the first minimum is at λ/a, second at 2λ/a. The separation is (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a (if the apothem is a), so the first minima would be at θ = λ/(2a), and the second minima at θ = 2λ/(2a) = λ/a. The separation is (λ/a - λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But why would the apothem a correspond to a slit width of 2a? Because the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a single slit, the apothem 'a' would be half the slit width. So the slit width would be 2a. So in that case, the first minima is at θ = (λ)/(2a) → because d =2a, so (2a)*sinθ= mλ → for m=1, sinθ=λ/(2a).

In this case, the angular separation between the first and second minima would be (λ/a - λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) =0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But then why is the polygon considered as a single slit? Because for a polygon, if it's a regular polygon and you have a large N, it's not a single slit but a circle.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is a bit of a trick. If the polygon becomes a circle, but the question is treating it as a single slit with width 2a. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says: it's a N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length 'a'. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a' (since the apothem approaches the radius). So the correct approach is to treat it as a circular aperture.

But then the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 1.014 λ/a, which is not one of the options. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem's setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the diffraction pattern in the far field for a circular aperture, but using a different formula. Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the approximation for small angles, and considering that the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ λ/(π a), but that would be for a single slit of width 2a. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the separation. Let me compute the numerical values again.

x1 = 3.8317, x2 =7.0156.

So x2 -x1 =3.1839.

So, Δθ ≈ (3.1839 * λ )/(π a) 

3.1839/ pi = ~ 1.013.

So Δθ ≈1.013 λ/a.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is to take the first minimum, which is 1.22 λ/a, but that's option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but a single slit with width 2a. So the first minimum is at λ/(2a) and the second at 2λ/(2a)= λ/a. So the separation is λ/(2a), option B.

But why would the polygon become a single slit? That doesn't make sense. The polygon with infinite sides becomes a circle, not a single slit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum as 1.22 λ/( diameter ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the apothems as 'a' for a polygon with N sides. For a regular polygon, the width (diameter) is 2R, where R is the radius. R is given by a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, R = a. So the diameter is 2a.

In a single-slit diffraction, the minima are at d sinθ = m λ, where d is the slit width. If d=2a, then the first minimum is at sinθ = λ/(2a), and the second at 2λ/(2a) = λ/a. So the separation between the first and second minima is (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But why would the polygon with infinite sides become a single slit of width 2a? It should become a circle with diameter 2a, but perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width 2a.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the first minimum of a circular aperture, which is 1.22 λ/a, and the separation between the first and second minima is the same as the position of the first minimum, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think what each option might correspond to.

Option C is 1.220 λ/a. That's the position of the first minimum in a circular aperture.

Option B is 0.5 λ/a, which is the separation between the first and second minima in a single-slit of width 2a.

Option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is about (1/2) * 1.012 λ/a, which is close to the separation I calculated earlier, but not exactly.

Wait, wait, 3.1839 / π is approximately 1.013. So 3.1839/π = 1.013, which is approximately 1.013. So Δθ =1.013 λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a.

Looking at the options, none have 1.013. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is the first minimum, but that's not the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the separation. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. The separation is definitely θ2 - θ1 = (x2 -x1) λ/(π a) =3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.013 λ/a.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is considering an approximation where only the first minimum is considered, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture, so the first minimum occurs when either the width or height diffraction pattern hits a minimum.

But without knowing the exact dimensions, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum of a circular aperture and taking the difference between the first and the zeroth order (which is the central maximum). But that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum as the first dark fringe, which in the single-slit is at 1.22 λ/a (but that's for a circular aperture). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrectly worded, and it's asking for the position of the first minimum, not the separation. But the question clearly states the separation between the first two minima.

Hmm.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, but that's the position of the first minimum. But the question asks for the separation between the first two minima, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, leading to the separation being 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a. 0.506 is approximately half of 1.013 (since 1.013/2 ≈ 0.5065). So perhaps the problem is considering the separation between the first minimum and the central maximum, which is at θ=0. But the central maximum isn't a minimum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first diffraction minimum, which occurs at θ1=1.22 λ/(π a) (using the correct formula for circular aperture), and the second minimum at θ2=2.234 λ/(π a). The angular separation is θ2-θ1= (2.234-1.22) λ/(π a) ≈1.014 λ/(π a) ≈ 0.322 λ/a. But that's also not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-express the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for a single slit of width a, not 2a. So the first minimum is at θ=λ/a, the second at 2λ/a. The separation is λ/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using the formula for a rectangular aperture, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly referring to the position of the first minimum as the separation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately (x2 -x1)/(2 pi a) ) *lambda. Wait, 3.1839/(2 * pi) is about 0.506. So 0.506 would be (3.1839/(2 pi )) * (λ/a) )

But why 2 pi? Because perhaps the formula is using something like (x2 -x1)/(2 pi a) *lambda.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the diffraction pattern in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the condition for destructive interference in a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a multiple slit with N slits, leading to a grating. But for N approaching infinity, this becomes a continuous aperture, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the options, the most probable correct approach is that the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, leading the separation between the first two minima to be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But I'm not confident because the polygon with infinite sides should be a circle, not a single slit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the correct answer intended is option C, 1.22 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question clearly asks for the separation between the first two minima.

Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately (x2 -x1)/(2 pi ) * lambda/(a).

Wait, let me compute 3.1839/(2 pi ) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.283 ≈0.506.

Ah! So 3.1839/(2 pi ) ≈ 0.506.

So the separation is (x2 -x1) * λ/(2 pi a ) = 0.506 λ/a.

So option D is 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, how did I get that?

Wait, the condition for minima is sinθ = x_m λ/(π a). So θ ≈ x_m λ/(π a) (small angle approximation).

So θ2 - θ1 = (x2 -x1) λ/(π a) ≈3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈1.013 λ/a.

But option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is exactly half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the minima in the circular aperture is sinθ = (x_m λ)/(2 pi a). So the separation would be (x2 -x1) λ/(2 pi a) ≈3.1839 * lambda/(2 pi a) ≈0.506 λ/a.

So that would match option D.

But why would the formula have 2 pi a in the denominator?

Wait, the correct formula for the minima is when J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k=2 pi/lambda. So, k a sinθ = x_m → sinθ = x_m lambda/(2 pi a).

So, θ ≈ x_m lambda/(2 pi a).

Ah! So I had the formula wrong earlier. Oh, that changes everything.

So the correct condition is sinθ = x_m λ/(2 pi a).

So for the first minimum, m=1: sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2 pi a).

Similarly, m=2: sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2 pi a).

So the angular positions:

θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2 pi a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.6098 λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2 pi a) ≈ (7.0156 /6.2832) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

The angular separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (1.116 - 0.6098) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a. Which matches option D.

Ah, so I see where I went wrong earlier. I had the formula incorrect. The correct formula for the minima in the circular aperture is sinθ = x_m λ/(2 pi a), not x_m λ/(pi a). So the correct separation is about 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction pattern created by an aperture shaped as a regular N-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length \( a \). When \( N \to \infty \), the polygon becomes a circular aperture with radius \( R = a \). The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Diffraction Pattern of a Circular Aperture**:  
   For a circular aperture, the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern (Airy pattern) occur when the argument of the Bessel function \( J_1 \) equals its zeros. The condition for the minima is:  
   \[
   \sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2 \pi a},
   \]  
   where \( x_m \) is the \( m \)-th zero of \( J_1 \), \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light, and \( a \) is the radius of the aperture.

2. **First Two Minima**:  
   The first minimum (\( m = 1 \)) occurs at \( x_1 = 3.8317 \), and the second minimum (\( m = 2 \)) occurs at \( x_2 = 7.0156 \). The angular positions of these minima are:  
   \[
   \theta_1 = \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2 \pi a}, \quad \theta_2 = \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2 \pi a}.
   \]  
   The angular separation between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) \lambda}{2 \pi a}.
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**:  
   Substituting \( x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2 \pi a}.
   \]  
   Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), we find:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated angular separation \( \Delta\theta \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a} \) matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of the circular aperture is approximately \( 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a} \).
