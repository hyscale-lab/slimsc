Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y. They mention that it's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y which is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used for spin-1/2 systems. Oh wait, yeah, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall their forms. I think σ_y is the same as this S matrix here. Because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right?

So if S is σ_y, then A_y is c times σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), that would make A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and which statement is correct among the options.

I remember that eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. So for σ_y, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues would be c*(1) and c*(-1).

So the eigenvalues of A_y should be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So that's ±h/(4π) as the eigenvalues.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues here are real? Or are they complex?

Wait no, wait... Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenvalues of σ_y are 1 and -1, which are real. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, which is real, the eigenvalues of A_y are real: ±c. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

But looking at the options, let's check each.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts should be zero. So this might not be correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that might not fit. Because earlier I thought the eigenvalues are h/(4π). Wait, let's compute h/(4π). Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. 4π is about 12.566. So h/(4π) is roughly 5.28e-35 J·s. That's a very small number, nowhere near 1 or 1/2. Wait, but perhaps the problem isn't using actual numbers but more about the structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because I thought S is σ_y. So σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So A_y = c * σ_y. Then eigenvalues of A_y would be c * (1) and c*(-1), which are c and -c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So their real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. But looking at the options, let me see.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Doesn't fit because the imaginary parts should be zero.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, the real parts here would be h/(4π), which is a specific value, not 1 or -1.

Wait, maybe I got the matrices wrong. Let me double-check. The matrix S is given as:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Which is indeed the Pauli matrix σ_y. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are c times the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues 1 and -1, A_y has eigenvalues c and -c.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because sometimes angular momentum operators have eigenvalues that are multiples of ħ. Wait, Planck's constant h is related to ħ by h = 2πħ. So ħ = h/(2π). So c is h/(4π) which is (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ħ*(1/2). So c = ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2. Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so c is (h/(2π))/2 = h/(4π). That's correct.

So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If c is h/(4π), and σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, then A_y's eigenvalues are ±c = ±h/(4π). Which is the same as (h/(4π)).

Wait, but in terms of ħ, c = (h/(4π)) = ( (2πħ) )/(4π ) ) = ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So in terms of h, it's ± h/(4π). So which option is correct?

Looking back, the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts zero.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is a small number, not 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I'm supposed to find whether the eigenfunctions can be shared between operators, or if the statements are about the structure.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm. I know that in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with the components, so they share eigenfunctions. So any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A². But can it be an eigenstate of A_z? Well, in general, you can't have eigenstates of two different components simultaneously unless they are in the same eigenbasis. So for spin-1/2, the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z. So this statement seems correct. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator A_y are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y given above. I'm not exactly sure what this means. The basis functions are the eigenvectors? Well, if the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are part of the basis. But I'm not sure if this is the correct way to interpret option D. It depends on what the statement is exactly saying.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Let me think about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So as for the eigenvalues, since A_y is proportional to σ_y, it has eigenvalues ±c, which are real. So the eigenfunctions are real?

Wait, no, the eigenvectors of σ_y are complex. For σ_y, the eigenvectors are |+y> and |-y>, which are (1, i)/√2 and (1, -i)/√2. So when multiplied by c, the operator A_y has the same eigenvectors as σ_y, just scaled.

So the eigenfunctions are those vectors. Now, looking at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components, any eigenstate of A² and A_y would be shared. So yes, the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az, because Az and A_y don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is two-dimensional. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthogonal basis for the space. But are they the basis functions for A_y? Maybe that's a bit ambiguous. I'm not sure, but I think option C is correct.

Looking back at the options, the correct eigenvalue part is that the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So none of the options A or B match that. So the correct statements must be among C and D.

So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, another point: Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, for a muon which is a spin-1/2 particle, A² would have eigenvalue ( (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ) ħ². Wait, but let me calculate that. For spin s=1/2, A² = s(s+1) ħ². So s=1/2, so A² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But the operator A² is the square of the Y-component operator? Wait, no, wait. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. So A² is the sum of the squares of its components: A² = A_x² + A_y² + A_z². But each of these components satisfy [A_i, A_j] = iε_ijk A_k terms, and so on.

But regardless, any eigenstate of A² and any one component (like A_y) is an eigenstate of A². So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it's also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct in that part.

Moreover, the same state cannot be an eigenstate of A_z because A_y and A_z don't commute. So option C is correct.

Looking back at the options, option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct.

So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the matrix operator is 2x2, so the basis is of two vectors. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which do form a basis. So the statement in D is correct? Or is it too vague?

Wait, the question says "the eigenfunctions... are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the vector space that the operator acts on. So in that sense, option D is correct.

But then, which option is correct? Because both C and D could be correct, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps the correct thing is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to focus on the eigenvalues.

Wait, the eigenvalues are real, as we found, which means statements about their imaginary parts being non-zero are wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct statements are either C or D.

Now, let's think about whether the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A_z. Since A_y and A_z don't commute, their eigenfunctions can't be the same. So for a state to be an eigenstate of both, it must be a simultaneous eigenstate, which for spin-1/2 systems is only possible if they share a common eigenbasis. But since [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x, they don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z, which makes option C correct.

Option D is a bit ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so the basis for the space is any set of two orthogonal vectors. The eigenvectors are orthogonal, so they form a basis. So option D is correct in that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. But the option says "the eigenfunctions... are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." I think that's a correct statement because the matrix operator has eigenvectors that form a basis.

But wait, if the operator has degenerate eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors might not form a complete basis. But in this case, the eigenvalues are non-degenerate (since they are ±c), so each eigenvector is one-dimensional, and together they form a basis.

So both C and D could be correct, but the question is which statement is correct. Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So which is correct?

Well, D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, hence they are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct, but C is also correct in its assertion.

Hmm, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct? But the options are presented as mutually exclusive.

Wait, no, the problem states that only one option is correct.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible statements.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A^2 commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², so the first part of C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct as well. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis (as they are orthogonal and non-degenerate), so D is correct.

Wait, but that would mean both C and D are correct statements. But the options can't have both correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not correct. Because the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, its basis is any two linearly independent vectors. The eigenvectors are specific vectors, but they are not the only basis. So the statement in D might be incorrect because the eigenfunctions are a particular basis, but not necessarily the only one.

Wait, the statement says "the eigenfunctions... are the basis functions of the matrix operator." So the matrix operator Ay acts on these basis functions. So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, which is a standard basis for the operator. So yes, D's statement is correct.

But in that case, both C and D would be correct statements. But the options are designed so that only one is correct. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's go back to the problem.

The problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Another thought: the eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which are real numbers. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

So the correct options are C and D.

But looking at the given options, which one is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Yes.

But which is correct as per the problem?

In the process of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

Option D is a general statement about the basis. If the eigenvectors form a basis, then D is correct. But whether that's the case.

Wait, since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors (since they are non-degenerate) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option is saying.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, correct because A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². The second part is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

This is a bit ambiguous. "Basis functions of the matrix operator" could imply that the operator is diagonal in that basis, which is true since the eigenvectors diagonalize the operator. So the eigenfunctions form a basis, and the operator is diagonal in that basis. So D is correct.

Now, the question is, which option is correct.

In this setup, both C and D could seem correct, but perhaps only one is.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct. So the process involves finding the eigenfunctions and determining their properties.

In this case, the fact that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² makes option C correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot \sigma_y \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**, as both suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( \sigma_y \) are the same as those of \( A_y \), scaled by \( c \). These eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space. This supports **Option D**, which states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \).

3. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the angular momentum operator and commutes with \( A_y \). Therefore, any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

4. **Comparison of Options C and D:**
   - Both **Option C** and **Option D** are valid statements. However, the question asks which statement is correct "during the calculation" of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. **Option C** directly addresses the properties of the eigenfunctions in relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \), making it the most relevant choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is relevant during the calculation.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y. They mention that it's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y which is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used for spin-1/2 systems. Oh wait, yeah, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall their forms. I think σ_y is the same as this S matrix here. Because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right?

So if S is σ_y, then A_y is c times σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), that would make A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and which statement is correct among the options.

I remember that eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. So for σ_y, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues would be c*(1) and c*(-1).

So the eigenvalues of A_y should be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So that's ±h/(4π) as the eigenvalues.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues here are real? Or are they complex?

Wait no, wait... Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenvalues of σ_y are 1 and -1, which are real. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, which is real, the eigenvalues of A_y are real: ±c. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

But looking at the options, let's check each.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts should be zero. So this might not be correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that might not fit. Because earlier I thought the eigenvalues are h/(4π). Wait, let's compute h/(4π). Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. 4π is about 12.566. So h/(4π) is roughly 5.28e-35 J·s. That's a very small number, nowhere near 1 or 1/2. Wait, but perhaps the problem isn't using actual numbers but more about the structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because I thought S is σ_y. So σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So A_y = c * σ_y. Then eigenvalues of A_y would be c * (1) and c*(-1), which are c and -c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So their real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. But looking at the options, let me see.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Doesn't fit because the imaginary parts should be zero.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, the real parts here would be h/(4π), which is a specific value, not 1 or -1.

Wait, maybe I got the matrices wrong. Let me double-check. The matrix S is given as:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Which is indeed the Pauli matrix σ_y. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are c times the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues 1 and -1, A_y has eigenvalues c and -c.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because sometimes angular momentum operators have eigenvalues that are multiples of ħ. Wait, Planck's constant h is related to ħ by h = 2πħ. So ħ = h/(2π). So c is h/(4π) which is (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ħ*(1/2). So c = ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2. Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so c is (h/(2π))/2 = h/(4π). That's correct.

So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If c is h/(4π), and σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, then A_y's eigenvalues are ±c = ±h/(4π). Which is the same as (h/(4π)).

Wait, but in terms of ħ, c = (h/(4π)) = ( (2πħ) )/(4π ) ) = ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So in terms of h, it's ± h/(4π). So which option is correct?

Looking back, the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts zero.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is a small number, not 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I'm supposed to find whether the eigenfunctions can be shared between operators, or if the statements are about the structure.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm. I know that in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with the components, so they share eigenfunctions. So any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A². But can it be an eigenstate of A_z? Well, in general, you can't have eigenstates of two different components simultaneously unless they are in the same eigenbasis. So for spin-1/2, the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z. So this statement seems correct. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator A_y are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y given above. I'm not exactly sure what this means. The basis functions are the eigenvectors? Well, if the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are part of the basis. But I'm not sure if this is the correct way to interpret option D. It depends on what the statement is exactly saying.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Let me think about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So as for the eigenvalues, since A_y is proportional to σ_y, it has eigenvalues ±c, which are real. So the eigenfunctions are real?

Wait, no, the eigenvectors of σ_y are complex. For σ_y, the eigenvectors are |+y> and |-y>, which are (1, i)/√2 and (1, -i)/√2. So when multiplied by c, the operator A_y has the same eigenvectors as σ_y, just scaled.

So the eigenfunctions are those vectors. Now, looking at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components, any eigenstate of A² and A_y would be shared. So yes, the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az, because Az and A_y don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is two-dimensional. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthogonal basis for the space. But are they the basis functions for A_y? Maybe that's a bit ambiguous. I'm not sure, but I think option C is correct.

Looking back at the options, the correct eigenvalue part is that the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So none of the options A or B match that. So the correct statements must be among C and D.

So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, another point: Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, for a muon which is a spin-1/2 particle, A² would have eigenvalue ( (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ) ħ². Wait, but let me calculate that. For spin s=1/2, A² = s(s+1) ħ². So s=1/2, so A² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But the operator A² is the square of the Y-component operator? Wait, no, wait. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. So A² is the sum of the squares of its components: A² = A_x² + A_y² + A_z². But each of these components satisfy [A_i, A_j] = iε_ijk A_k terms, and so on.

But regardless, any eigenstate of A² and any one component (like A_y) is an eigenstate of A². So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it's also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct in that part.

Moreover, the same state cannot be an eigenstate of A_z because A_y and A_z don't commute. So option C is correct.

Looking back at the options, option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct.

So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the matrix operator is 2x2, so the basis is of two vectors. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which do form a basis. So the statement in D is correct? Or is it too vague?

Wait, the question says "the eigenfunctions... are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the vector space that the operator acts on. So in that sense, option D is correct.

But then, which option is correct? Because both C and D could be correct, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps the correct thing is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to focus on the eigenvalues.

Wait, the eigenvalues are real, as we found, which means statements about their imaginary parts being non-zero are wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct statements are either C or D.

Now, let's think about whether the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A_z. Since A_y and A_z don't commute, their eigenfunctions can't be the same. So for a state to be an eigenstate of both, it must be a simultaneous eigenstate, which for spin-1/2 systems is only possible if they share a common eigenbasis. But since [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x, they don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z, which makes option C correct.

Option D is a bit ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so the basis for the space is any set of two orthogonal vectors. The eigenvectors are orthogonal, so they form a basis. So option D is correct in that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. But the option says "the eigenfunctions... are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." I think that's a correct statement because the matrix operator has eigenvectors that form a basis.

But wait, if the operator has degenerate eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors might not form a complete basis. But in this case, the eigenvalues are non-degenerate (since they are ±c), so each eigenvector is one-dimensional, and together they form a basis.

So both C and D could be correct, but the question is which statement is correct. Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So which is correct?

Well, D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, hence they are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct, but C is also correct in its assertion.

Hmm, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct? But the options are presented as mutually exclusive.

Wait, no, the problem states that only one option is correct.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible statements.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A^2 commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², so the first part of C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct as well. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis (as they are orthogonal and non-degenerate), so D is correct.

Wait, but that would mean both C and D are correct statements. But the options can't have both correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not correct. Because the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, its basis is any two linearly independent vectors. The eigenvectors are specific vectors, but they are not the only basis. So the statement in D might be incorrect because the eigenfunctions are a particular basis, but not necessarily the only one.

Wait, the statement says "the eigenfunctions... are the basis functions of the matrix operator." So the matrix operator Ay acts on these basis functions. So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, which is a standard basis for the operator. So yes, D's statement is correct.

But in that case, both C and D would be correct statements. But the options are designed so that only one is correct. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's go back to the problem.

The problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Another thought: the eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which are real numbers. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

So the correct options are C and D.

But looking at the given options, which one is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Yes.

But which is correct as per the problem?

In the process of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

Option D is a general statement about the basis. If the eigenvectors form a basis, then D is correct. But whether that's the case.

Wait, since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors (since they are non-degenerate) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option is saying.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, correct because A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². The second part is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

This is a bit ambiguous. "Basis functions of the matrix operator" could imply that the operator is diagonal in that basis, which is true since the eigenvectors diagonalize the operator. So the eigenfunctions form a basis, and the operator is diagonal in that basis. So D is correct.

Now, the question is, which option is correct.

In this setup, both C and D could seem correct, but perhaps only one is.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct. So the process involves finding the eigenfunctions and determining their properties.

In this case, the fact that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² makes option C correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot \sigma_y \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**, as both suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( \sigma_y \) are the same as those of \( A_y \), scaled by \( c \). These eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space. This supports **Option D**, which states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \).

3. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the angular momentum operator and commutes with \( A_y \). Therefore, any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

4. **Comparison of Options C and D:**
   - Both **Option C** and **Option D** are valid statements. However, the question asks which statement is correct "during the calculation" of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. **Option C** directly addresses the properties of the eigenfunctions in relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \), making it the most relevant choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is relevant during the calculation.
