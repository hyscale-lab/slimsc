Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question says. I've got an unknown compound that's been characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700. The NMR has several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, two of the signals are more complex: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching. And the strong peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl, like a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but the presence of O-H would suggest a carboxylic acid since esters and ketones don't have that broad peak. So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all of them end with COOH except maybe the last one? Wait, no, looking again. The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all of them have COOH at the end, right? So that's a carboxylic acid. So the FTIR data fits.

Now, the NMR part. The question says none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So all structures are probably branched or cyclic without any double bonds.

In the NMR, the complex splitting suggests some kind of coupling with multiple neighboring protons. Let's think about the splitting. A doublet of triplets of quartets is a more complex splitting. Maybe it's a proton that's next to two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, if a CH has neighboring CH2 groups or something.

Wait, let me think about each option's structure.

Option D: Structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the carbonyl is directly attached to the COOH. Let me draw this: maybe it's like (CH2CH3)C(H)(CH3) connected to another C(H)(CH3), then COOH.

Alternatively, the structure would be CH2CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. Wait, perhaps it's more like (CH2CH3)C(CH3)H-C(CH3)H-COOH. So, the central part is two geminal CH3 groups attached to CH groups, which are connected.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's CH3 connected to a C which has a C2H5 group, then another CH connected to another C2H5, then CH2COOH. So perhaps the structure is (CH3)(C2H5)CH-CH(CH2COOH). Wait, maybe it's (CH2CH3)C(CH3)-CH(CH2COOH)-C(CH2CH3). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the structure could be more like:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

Wait, maybe it's a diastereotopic situation? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for the NMR signals. Let's think about each molecule.

The NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complex splitting pattern. How does that happen? Let's break it down. A quartet suggests coupling with three equivalent protons. A triplet suggests coupling with two. So a quartet would be like splitting into four, a triplet into three.

So if a proton is next to a group that has multiple neighboring protons, perhaps a CH group next to a CH2CH2 group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to vicinal coupling. Let's think about each option.

Option D: The structure is (CH2CH3)C(H)(CH3) and another C(H)(CH3) connected to COOH. So each of the two central CH groups is attached to a CH2CH3 and two CH3 groups. Wait, no, each CH would have one CH2CH3 and two CH3s? Or is it each CH has one CH3 and one CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and two CH3 groups.

Wait, but in Option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the two middle CH groups has a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group attached. So each CH has two different groups: one CH3 and one CH2CH3. So each of these CH groups would have neighboring protons.

Wait, the CH groups are connected to each other. So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two CH groups are adjacent. Each CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH3 attached. So these CH groups are in a geminal position? No, because each is attached to the other, so they're adjacent.

Wait, perhaps each of these CH groups is attached to the same carbon. No, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH, meaning that each C(H)(CH3) is a separate carbon. So, the structure is:

- COOH is at the end.

- Then a CH2 group connected to a C(H)(CH3), which is connected to another C(H)(CH3), which is connected to CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the chain would be: COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, from the COOH, it's CH2 connected to a C(H)(CH3), which is connected to another C(H)(CH3), then to CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

(CH3CH2)-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two C(H)(CH3) are adjacent, each with a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group.

So each of the CH groups in the middle is attached to two different groups: CH2CH3 and CH3.

So, the protons on those CH groups would have neighboring protons from adjacent CH groups.

Wait, so each of those CH protons would be next to two other CH groups. So, each CH would have two neighboring CH groups.

Alternatively, maybe each CH has two neighboring sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps each CH group is connected to a C that has a CH2CH3 and a CH3. So, the structure is like:

CH2CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH3, a H, and are connected to each other and to the COOH and CH2CH3 groups.

In that case, the CH protons on the middle carbons would be adjacent to each other. So, each proton on the CH would be next to another CH group, which may have protons.

Wait, but each CH has only one H. So, each of the middle CH protons would be next to the other CH's H. So, each would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet.

But in the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more complex than just a doublet. So perhaps there are more coupling interactions.

Hmm, perhaps the H on each CH is also near other H's, like from other groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the middle CH's H's are coupled with H's from adjacent groups.

Wait, let me think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure would be:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, each of the two middle C's have a H, a CH3, and a CH2CH2CH3 (C2H5) group. Wait, no, C2H5 is ethyl, so each middle C has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached?

Wait, no, it's (C2H5) as in ethyl. So each middle CH is connected to an ethyl group and a methyl group. Wait, but looking at the formula: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH3, a C2H5, and a H. So each CH is connected to CH3, C2H5, and the next CH. So perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)(C2H5)CH-CH(CH2COOH)(C2H5).

Wait, no, wait. The first CH has a CH3 and a C2H5 group, and the next CH has a C2H5 and a CH2COOH group.

Wait, perhaps each middle CH has a CH3, a C2H5, and is connected to another CH. So the two CH groups are adjacent. So, each H on the CH would be next to the H on the adjacent CH, as well as any other Hs nearby.

Wait, perhaps each CH is attached to another CH, so their Hs are adjacent, leading to coupling. But each CH also has an ethyl and methyl group, which may have their own Hs. So, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are coupling with multiple sets of Hs.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR splitting. The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Doublet of triplet: that means each proton is split by two different coupling constants. For example, if a proton is next to two different sets of protons, each causing their own splitting.

But a doublet of triplets of quartets would be a proton that is split by three different sets of coupling, each with a different J value. Or perhaps it's a more complex coupling situation.

Wait, let's break down the splitting. A quartet arises when a proton is coupled with three equivalent protons. A triplet when coupled with two. So, a quartet of triplets would mean first split into a quartet (coupling with three Hs), each of those peaks then split into triplets (coupling with two Hs), and each of those split again into quartets again? Or maybe the order is different.

Wait, but the way splitting works is each coupling is applied in order. So, for example, a proton that is first split by a triplet (coupled with two Hs), then each of those peaks is further split into quartets (coupled with three Hs), and then each of those into doublets (coupled with one H). So the overall pattern would be a doublet of quartets of triplets, but the terminology can vary based on order.

Alternatively, the splitting might be due to the proton being adjacent to multiple non-equivalent protons. For example, if a CH group is next to a CH2 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH groups are next to a CH2 group and another CH, leading to multiple couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group connected to a CH2CH3 group. So, the CH's H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Then, if that CH is also next to another CH group, which has one H, that would add a doublet splitting, making a triplet of doublets, which is a sextet. Hmm, not matching the given description.

Alternatively, maybe the H is next to two different sets of Hs. For example, a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So the H on CH would couple with the two Hs on CH2, giving a triplet, and with the three Hs on CH3, giving a quartet. So the splitting would be a quartet of triplets or a triplet of quartets, depending on the order.

Wait, but the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more complex. So perhaps each H is coupled with three different groups with different J values.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a more complex system, like being next to a CH2 and another CH which is next to another CH2. So, each coupling adds another layer of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a geminal di-substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Let me think about each option's structure and possible NMR signals.

Option D: Each CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH3 attached. So, each CH's H would be adjacent to the CH3 group (which has three Hs) and the CH2CH3 group (which has two Hs). So, the H on the CH would couple with the CH3's Hs (so a quartet for each coupling) and the CH2CH3's Hs (a triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH is next to another CH, leading to coupling with their H, which would be a doublet. So if the H is coupled with another H (doublet), and also coupled with three Hs (from CH3, quartet), and another two Hs (from CH2CH3, triplet), the splitting would be a doublet of quartets of triplets.

Wait, that seems to fit the description. So the H would first split into a doublet (coupled with one adjacent H), then each of those splits into a quartet (coupled with three Hs), and each of those into triplets (coupled with two Hs). So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets? Or maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of quartets of triplets, but I'm not sure about the exact order of splitting.

Another approach: looking at the integration of the NMR signals might help, but the question doesn't provide that. So I have to rely on the splitting patterns.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of nonequivalent protons. The presence of multiple coupling constants suggests that each proton is adjacent to multiple sets of non-equivalent hydrogens.

Another thought: the splitting could be due to a geminal coupling, but that's rare because geminal protons are usually equivalent and don't split each other. So maybe it's vicinal coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH group next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH group. Let's imagine a structure like:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, but that's more of a straight chain. Alternatively, perhaps the CH groups are adjacent, and each is connected to different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diethyl group attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH, then to COOH.

Wait, let me think about option B and D.

Option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So the two middle CH groups each have an ethyl (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3) group attached. So, each CH is bonded to a CH3, a C2H5, and the adjacent CH. So the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the next CH, as well as any Hs from the substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are ethyl and methyl groups. So each CH's H is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH. So, each CH's H would couple with the other CH's H, leading to a doublet. But that's only a doublet, which doesn't explain the more complex splitting.

Hmm. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait, another thought: the fact that none of the NMR signals are vinyl Hs suggests that the molecule is not conjugated, so no double bonds. So the structure is more likely a branched molecule with single bonds.

Looking again at the options, the structures are all similar, with substituents attached to CH groups leading to COOH.

Wait, maybe the splitting comes from diastereotopic protons. Diastereotopic protons are a pair of non-equivalent protons that are in a symmetric environment. For example, in a CH2 group attached to two different substituents, each H would be diastereotopic and couple with each other, leading to a doublet.

But in this case, the splitting is more complex than a doublet. So perhaps diastereotopic coupling isn't the main factor here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a bridge structure, but I don't think any of the options present such a structure.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the number of neighboring Hs each proton has. Let's consider each option's structure and the possible coupling.

Option D: The two CH groups are each connected to a CH3 and a CH2CH3. So each CH's H is adjacent to the other CH's H, and also near the Hs of the substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are CH3 and CH2CH3. So the CH's H would be adjacent to the Hs on CH3 and CH2CH3?

No, because the substituent Hs are on the substituents, not on the same carbon. So, perhaps the H on the CH is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but that would only give a doublet, not a more complex pattern. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option A: Structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the two middle CH groups each have an ethyl (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3) group. So each H on the CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. Each CH is connected to CH3, C2H5, and the next CH. So, again, the H on each CH would be adjacent to another H, leading to a doublet.

But the NMR shows more complex splitting. So maybe this isn't the right option either.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, each of the two middle CH groups has a CH3 and another CH3 attached. So, the structure would be:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So, each CH is connected to two CH3 groups and the next CH. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. But each CH is also connected to two CH3 groups. So, the H on the CH would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet, and perhaps the neighboring CH3 groups, but CH3 groups are on the same carbon, so their Hs would be equivalent and not split the signal further. Or would they?

Wait, no, because each CH is attached to two CH3 groups. So, the CH's H is adjacent to the CH3 groups, which have three Hs each. So, the H on CH would be next to 3 Hs (from the CH3 group) and another H (from the adjacent CH). So, the coupling would be with four Hs? No, because the CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH, so the H on CH is attached to the same carbon as the CH3. So, the H on CH is not adjacent to the CH3 Hs—those are on the same carbon, so they are equivalent and don't split each other. So, the H on CH would only couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet.

Hmm, that's not matching the given NMR data. So perhaps option C isn't the right answer.

Option A's structure: Each middle CH has a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the next CH, but also in close proximity to the C2H5 and CH3 groups' Hs, but not directly adjacent.

Wait, but the Hs on the C2H5 and CH3 are on different carbons, so the H on the CH would only couple with the H on the adjacent CH. So again, perhaps only a doublet, which doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possibility that the structure has a CH group next to a CH2 group. For example, if a CH is next to a CH2, which is next to another CH group. So the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, and also with the H on the next CH.

So, the H would first split into a triplet (from CH2), then each of those would split into a doublet (from the next CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. But the problem statement has a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Wait, so perhaps the H is coupled with three different sets of Hs. For example, a CH group next to a CH2 (two Hs), a CH3 (three Hs), and another CH (one H). So each coupling would add another split.

So, the initial split would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH), then each of those would split into a quartet (from CH3), and each of those into a triplet (from CH2). So the overall pattern would be a doublet of quartets of triplets, but the problem says a doublet of triplets of quartets. The order might vary based on the coupling constants, but the main point is that the proton is coupled to three different sets of Hs.

Which option's structure would result in such a scenario?

Looking back: Option D's structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH3.

So, the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet), and also coupled with the Hs on the CH2CH3 groups and CH3 groups.

Wait, but the CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH, so their Hs are equivalent and don't cause splitting. The CH2CH3 groups are attached to the same carbon as the CH, so their Hs are not adjacent either. So, the Hs on the CH2CH3 are two Hs on a CH2 group, but that's not adjacent to the CH's H. So, the H on the CH would only couple with the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet, not a more complex pattern.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something in the structure analysis.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a branching that causes the H to be adjacent to multiple different groups. For example, a CH group connected to a CH2CH2 group and another CH group, each with their own Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a bridge or a ring structure, but none of the options seem to suggest that.

Another thought: the presence of multiple neighboring CH groups could lead to complex splitting. For example, if a CH is connected to two other CH groups, each with their own Hs.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, each middle CH has a C2H5 and a CH3 attached. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. Additionally, each CH is connected to a C2H5 group, which has two Hs on the adjacent carbon. Wait, but those Hs are on a different carbon, so they wouldn't directly couple with the CH's H.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the quartet and triplet. A quartet suggests coupling with three Hs. Where would that come from in the structure?

If a H is next to a CH2 group (two Hs), then a triplet. If it's next to a CH3 group (three Hs), then a quartet. But the H would need to be adjacent to both a CH2 and a CH3 group to have both splits.

Which option has a CH group next to both CH2 and CH3 groups?

Looking at option D: Each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH3. Wait, but CH2CH3 is a propyl group? No, CH2CH3 is ethyl. So CH2CH3 is a substituent, but the H on the CH would not be adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl group. Only the CH3 group is attached to the same carbon as the CH. So, the CH's H is only adjacent to the CH3 group's Hs if they are on the same carbon, which they are not.

Wait, no, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the CH is attached to CH2CH3 (ethyl) and CH3. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH, and perhaps the ethyl group's Hs are on the adjacent CH2. But those Hs are on a different carbon, so would they be coupled?

Protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal) can couple if they are on adjacent carbons, but the coupling is usually weaker than geminal or diastereotopic. So, in this case, the H on the CH would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, which is a doublet. But what about the Hs on the ethyl group? The ethyl group is attached to the same CH, so the Hs on the ethyl are on the next carbon. So, the H on the CH would not be adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl group. So, no coupling there.

Hmm. So perhaps the H on the CH only couples with the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet. But the NMR shows a more complex splitting pattern. So maybe option D isn't the right answer.

Wait, what about option A? Its structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Each middle CH has a C2H5 and a CH3 attached. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. Additionally, each CH is attached to an ethyl group, which has Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, the H on the CH is next to the ethyl group's CH2, which has two Hs. So, the H on the CH would couple with both the adjacent CH's H (doublet) and the ethyl group's two Hs (triplet). So, the splitting would first be a doublet (from the adjacent CH), and each of those would split into a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2), resulting in a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps there's another layer of coupling. Where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is next to another CH group, leading to further coupling. But in option A, the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, each ethyl group is attached to the CH, but the CH2 of the ethyl is connected to a CH3. So, the ethyl group is -CH2CH3. The Hs on the CH2 of the ethyl would be adjacent to the CH's H. So, the CH's H would couple with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet. Additionally, it would couple with the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet. And perhaps there's another coupling.

Wait, but the ethyl's CH2 is connected to the CH, so the H on the CH is adjacent to the ethyl's CH2's Hs. So, the H on the CH would experience coupling with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and also with the adjacent CH's H (doublet). So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets, which fits part of the data.

But the NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps there's another coupling. Where would that come from?

Hmm, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is connected to another CH or something else. Wait, no, in the structure of option A, the ethyl is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is connected to the CH and a CH3. So the Hs on the ethyl's CH2 are adjacent to the CH's H, leading to a triplet for the CH's H from that coupling.

But then the CH's H is also adjacent to the other CH's H, leading to a doublet. So the overall splitting is a doublet of triplets.

But the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that would require another coupling. Where would that come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH's H is also coupled with another set of Hs, such as from a CH3 group attached elsewhere. But in option A, the CH is attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. The CH3's Hs are on the same carbon as the CH's H, so they don't cause splitting. The C2H5's Hs are on the adjacent CH2, which is connected to the CH. So, maybe the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet, the adjacent CH's H leading to a doublet, and perhaps another coupling with another group.

Alternatively, maybe the CH is also next to a CH2 group that's part of the main chain. Let me think about option A's structure again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

The two middle CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and a CH3. The CH2COOH is at the end.

So, each CH's H is adjacent to the CH2COOH's CH2 group. The CH2COOH has two Hs, right? So, the H on the CH would also couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, that's another coupling.

So, the H on the CH is coupled with:

1. The adjacent CH's H → doublet.

2. The two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (C2H5) → triplet.

3. The two Hs on the CH2COOH group → triplet.

Wait, but that would be three different couplings. So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2COOH) of triplet (from ethyl CH2) of doublet (from adjacent CH). Or any order. So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets of triplets, which doesn't exactly match the given data. But the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2COOH is connected to another CH group, but no, the structure is CH2COOH. So it's a CH2 connected to COOH.

Wait, maybe my approach isn't working. Let me think of another angle. The FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is carbonyl. So, the compound is a carboxylic acid, as the O-H is present.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl Hs suggests no double bonds, so it's a saturated compound.

Looking at the options, all have COOH at the end, so that's correct.

The NMR splitting patterns suggest that the Hs are in a complex environment with multiple neighboring Hs, possibly from different substituents.

Perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Because each CH has a C2H5 and a CH3, and the CH2COOH group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that leads to the quartet part.

Another idea: the CH2COOH group has two Hs. So, the H on the CH would be coupled with those two Hs, leading to a triplet. The H on the CH is also coupled with the H on the adjacent CH (doublet), and perhaps with the Hs on the C2H5 group (which would be two Hs on the CH2 of the ethyl). So, that would be another triplet.

So, the H on the CH would first couple with the adjacent CH's H (doublet), then each of those would be split by the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and each of those would be split by the two Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets. But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches. And another signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps that's another proton in the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the option where the H is coupled with three different sets of Hs: one with two Hs (triplet), another with three Hs (quartet), and another with one H (doublet).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this case, the two middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet), and also connected to the CH2CH3 group, which has two Hs. So, the H on the CH would also couple with the two Hs on the CH2CH3, leading to a triplet. So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2CH3 group's Hs are on the adjacent carbon, leading to coupling. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH2CH3's two Hs. So, the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the CH2CH3 (triplet), and with the adjacent CH's H (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But again, not matching the quartet part.

Wait, perhaps in option D, each CH group is attached to a CH2CH3. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH2CH3's Hs. The CH2CH3 has two Hs, so the H on the CH would couple with them, giving a triplet. Also, the H is adjacent to the other CH's H, giving a doublet. So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data has a quartet in the splitting. Where would that come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the H is also adjacent to a CH3 group on the same carbon. Wait, the CH3 is on the same carbon as the CH, so their Hs would be equivalent and not split the signal.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of signals in the NMR.

Each option has different substituents. Option D has two CH groups each attached to a CH2CH3 and CH3. So, perhaps the NMR would show more signals due to the different environments.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again about option A's structure:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

Each middle CH has a C2H5 and a CH3. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the other CH's H (doublet), and also adjacent to the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), and perhaps the two Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of triplets. That would match one of the signals in the problem.

But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps another H in the molecule is coupled with three Hs (quartet) and two Hs (triplet) and one H (doublet).

Alternatively, maybe the Hs on the ethyl groups are causing the quartet. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the number of unique H environments in each option.

Option D: There are two CH groups each attached to a CH2CH3 and CH3. Are these CH groups equivalent? If the molecule is symmetric, then the two CH groups would be equivalent, leading to a single peak for their Hs. But if the substituents are different, they might not be. Wait, in option D, each CH is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3. Are those substituents making the two CH groups equivalent? If the substituents are in a symmetrical position, then yes. For example, if the two CH groups are symmetrically attached to the COOH group, then their Hs would be equivalent, leading to a single peak.

But in the NMR, the splitting suggests that each H is in a unique environment, so perhaps the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the two CH groups are not equivalent, leading to two different peaks, each with their own splitting.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thing: the problem says that in the 1H NMR, none of the peaks correspond to vinyl Hs. So, all Hs are in single bonds. So, the structure is fully saturated.

Putting all this together, I think option A might be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. The strong peak at 1700 is a carbonyl, which in this case is a carboxylic acid.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl Hs confirms it's a saturated compound.

The splitting patterns suggest complex coupling. So, the correct structure must have a proton that is coupled with multiple different sets of Hs.

Option A: Each middle CH is attached to a C2H5 and a CH3. The Hs on the CH would couple with the adjacent CH's H (doublet), the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the two Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets of doublets, but the problem has a quartet in the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to another CH group, leading to a quartet. But I don't think that's the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. These observations suggest the compound is a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum indicates the absence of vinyl hydrogens, ruling out any double bonds, and shows complex splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest protons in a complex environment with multiple coupling interactions.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure consists of two middle CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a C₂H₅ (ethyl) group, followed by a CH₂COOH group.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet), the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), and the two Hs on the CH₂COOH group (triplet). This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches one of the signals in the NMR data.

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure has two middle CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a C₂H₅ group, with a COOH group at the end.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet). This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets, which does not fully match the given NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure consists of two middle CH groups, each attached to two CH₃ groups, followed by a CH₂COOH group.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet). However, the CH₃ groups on the same carbon do not cause further splitting due to equivalence. This results in a simpler splitting pattern (doublet), which does not match the complex splitting in the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure has two middle CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) group, with a COOH group at the end.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet). This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets, which does not fully match the given NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Option A provides the best match to the NMR data. The splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of triplets aligns with the described signals, and the structure is consistent with the FTIR data indicating a carboxylic acid. The other options fail to account for the observed splitting patterns or do not match the functional group data.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question says. I've got an unknown compound that's been characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700. The NMR has several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, two of the signals are more complex: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching. And the strong peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl, like a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but the presence of O-H would suggest a carboxylic acid since esters and ketones don't have that broad peak. So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all of them end with COOH except maybe the last one? Wait, no, looking again. The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all of them have COOH at the end, right? So that's a carboxylic acid. So the FTIR data fits.

Now, the NMR part. The question says none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So all structures are probably branched or cyclic without any double bonds.

In the NMR, the complex splitting suggests some kind of coupling with multiple neighboring protons. Let's think about the splitting. A doublet of triplets of quartets is a more complex splitting. Maybe it's a proton that's next to two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, if a CH has neighboring CH2 groups or something.

Wait, let me think about each option's structure.

Option D: Structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the carbonyl is directly attached to the COOH. Let me draw this: maybe it's like (CH2CH3)C(H)(CH3) connected to another C(H)(CH3), then COOH.

Alternatively, the structure would be CH2CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. Wait, perhaps it's more like (CH2CH3)C(CH3)H-C(CH3)H-COOH. So, the central part is two geminal CH3 groups attached to CH groups, which are connected.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's CH3 connected to a C which has a C2H5 group, then another CH connected to another C2H5, then CH2COOH. So perhaps the structure is (CH3)(C2H5)CH-CH(CH2COOH). Wait, maybe it's (CH2CH3)C(CH3)-CH(CH2COOH)-C(CH2CH3). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the structure could be more like:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

Wait, maybe it's a diastereotopic situation? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for the NMR signals. Let's think about each molecule.

The NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complex splitting pattern. How does that happen? Let's break it down. A quartet suggests coupling with three equivalent protons. A triplet suggests coupling with two. So a quartet would be like splitting into four, a triplet into three.

So if a proton is next to a group that has multiple neighboring protons, perhaps a CH group next to a CH2CH2 group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to vicinal coupling. Let's think about each option.

Option D: The structure is (CH2CH3)C(H)(CH3) and another C(H)(CH3) connected to COOH. So each of the two central CH groups is attached to a CH2CH3 and two CH3 groups. Wait, no, each CH would have one CH2CH3 and two CH3s? Or is it each CH has one CH3 and one CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and two CH3 groups.

Wait, but in Option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the two middle CH groups has a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group attached. So each CH has two different groups: one CH3 and one CH2CH3. So each of these CH groups would have neighboring protons.

Wait, the CH groups are connected to each other. So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two CH groups are adjacent. Each CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH3 attached. So these CH groups are in a geminal position? No, because each is attached to the other, so they're adjacent.

Wait, perhaps each of these CH groups is attached to the same carbon. No, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH, meaning that each C(H)(CH3) is a separate carbon. So, the structure is:

- COOH is at the end.

- Then a CH2 group connected to a C(H)(CH3), which is connected to another C(H)(CH3), which is connected to CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the chain would be: COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, from the COOH, it's CH2 connected to a C(H)(CH3), which is connected to another C(H)(CH3), then to CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

(CH3CH2)-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two C(H)(CH3) are adjacent, each with a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group.

So each of the CH groups in the middle is attached to two different groups: CH2CH3 and CH3.

So, the protons on those CH groups would have neighboring protons from adjacent CH groups.

Wait, so each of those CH protons would be next to two other CH groups. So, each CH would have two neighboring CH groups.

Alternatively, maybe each CH has two neighboring sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps each CH group is connected to a C that has a CH2CH3 and a CH3. So, the structure is like:

CH2CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH3, a H, and are connected to each other and to the COOH and CH2CH3 groups.

In that case, the CH protons on the middle carbons would be adjacent to each other. So, each proton on the CH would be next to another CH group, which may have protons.

Wait, but each CH has only one H. So, each of the middle CH protons would be next to the other CH's H. So, each would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet.

But in the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more complex than just a doublet. So perhaps there are more coupling interactions.

Hmm, perhaps the H on each CH is also near other H's, like from other groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the middle CH's H's are coupled with H's from adjacent groups.

Wait, let me think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure would be:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, each of the two middle C's have a H, a CH3, and a CH2CH2CH3 (C2H5) group. Wait, no, C2H5 is ethyl, so each middle C has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached?

Wait, no, it's (C2H5) as in ethyl. So each middle CH is connected to an ethyl group and a methyl group. Wait, but looking at the formula: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH3, a C2H5, and a H. So each CH is connected to CH3, C2H5, and the next CH. So perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)(C2H5)CH-CH(CH2COOH)(C2H5).

Wait, no, wait. The first CH has a CH3 and a C2H5 group, and the next CH has a C2H5 and a CH2COOH group.

Wait, perhaps each middle CH has a CH3, a C2H5, and is connected to another CH. So the two CH groups are adjacent. So, each H on the CH would be next to the H on the adjacent CH, as well as any other Hs nearby.

Wait, perhaps each CH is attached to another CH, so their Hs are adjacent, leading to coupling. But each CH also has an ethyl and methyl group, which may have their own Hs. So, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are coupling with multiple sets of Hs.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR splitting. The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Doublet of triplet: that means each proton is split by two different coupling constants. For example, if a proton is next to two different sets of protons, each causing their own splitting.

But a doublet of triplets of quartets would be a proton that is split by three different sets of coupling, each with a different J value. Or perhaps it's a more complex coupling situation.

Wait, let's break down the splitting. A quartet arises when a proton is coupled with three equivalent protons. A triplet when coupled with two. So, a quartet of triplets would mean first split into a quartet (coupling with three Hs), each of those peaks then split into triplets (coupling with two Hs), and each of those split again into quartets again? Or maybe the order is different.

Wait, but the way splitting works is each coupling is applied in order. So, for example, a proton that is first split by a triplet (coupled with two Hs), then each of those peaks is further split into quartets (coupled with three Hs), and then each of those into doublets (coupled with one H). So the overall pattern would be a doublet of quartets of triplets, but the terminology can vary based on order.

Alternatively, the splitting might be due to the proton being adjacent to multiple non-equivalent protons. For example, if a CH group is next to a CH2 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH groups are next to a CH2 group and another CH, leading to multiple couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group connected to a CH2CH3 group. So, the CH's H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Then, if that CH is also next to another CH group, which has one H, that would add a doublet splitting, making a triplet of doublets, which is a sextet. Hmm, not matching the given description.

Alternatively, maybe the H is next to two different sets of Hs. For example, a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So the H on CH would couple with the two Hs on CH2, giving a triplet, and with the three Hs on CH3, giving a quartet. So the splitting would be a quartet of triplets or a triplet of quartets, depending on the order.

Wait, but the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more complex. So perhaps each H is coupled with three different groups with different J values.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a more complex system, like being next to a CH2 and another CH which is next to another CH2. So, each coupling adds another layer of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a geminal di-substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Let me think about each option's structure and possible NMR signals.

Option D: Each CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH3 attached. So, each CH's H would be adjacent to the CH3 group (which has three Hs) and the CH2CH3 group (which has two Hs). So, the H on the CH would couple with the CH3's Hs (so a quartet for each coupling) and the CH2CH3's Hs (a triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH is next to another CH, leading to coupling with their H, which would be a doublet. So if the H is coupled with another H (doublet), and also coupled with three Hs (from CH3, quartet), and another two Hs (from CH2CH3, triplet), the splitting would be a doublet of quartets of triplets.

Wait, that seems to fit the description. So the H would first split into a doublet (coupled with one adjacent H), then each of those splits into a quartet (coupled with three Hs), and each of those into triplets (coupled with two Hs). So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets? Or maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of quartets of triplets, but I'm not sure about the exact order of splitting.

Another approach: looking at the integration of the NMR signals might help, but the question doesn't provide that. So I have to rely on the splitting patterns.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of nonequivalent protons. The presence of multiple coupling constants suggests that each proton is adjacent to multiple sets of non-equivalent hydrogens.

Another thought: the splitting could be due to a geminal coupling, but that's rare because geminal protons are usually equivalent and don't split each other. So maybe it's vicinal coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH group next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH group. Let's imagine a structure like:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, but that's more of a straight chain. Alternatively, perhaps the CH groups are adjacent, and each is connected to different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diethyl group attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH, then to COOH.

Wait, let me think about option B and D.

Option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So the two middle CH groups each have an ethyl (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3) group attached. So, each CH is bonded to a CH3, a C2H5, and the adjacent CH. So the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the next CH, as well as any Hs from the substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are ethyl and methyl groups. So each CH's H is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH. So, each CH's H would couple with the other CH's H, leading to a doublet. But that's only a doublet, which doesn't explain the more complex splitting.

Hmm. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait, another thought: the fact that none of the NMR signals are vinyl Hs suggests that the molecule is not conjugated, so no double bonds. So the structure is more likely a branched molecule with single bonds.

Looking again at the options, the structures are all similar, with substituents attached to CH groups leading to COOH.

Wait, maybe the splitting comes from diastereotopic protons. Diastereotopic protons are a pair of non-equivalent protons that are in a symmetric environment. For example, in a CH2 group attached to two different substituents, each H would be diastereotopic and couple with each other, leading to a doublet.

But in this case, the splitting is more complex than a doublet. So perhaps diastereotopic coupling isn't the main factor here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a bridge structure, but I don't think any of the options present such a structure.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the number of neighboring Hs each proton has. Let's consider each option's structure and the possible coupling.

Option D: The two CH groups are each connected to a CH3 and a CH2CH3. So each CH's H is adjacent to the other CH's H, and also near the Hs of the substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are CH3 and CH2CH3. So the CH's H would be adjacent to the Hs on CH3 and CH2CH3?

No, because the substituent Hs are on the substituents, not on the same carbon. So, perhaps the H on the CH is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but that would only give a doublet, not a more complex pattern. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option A: Structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the two middle CH groups each have an ethyl (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3) group. So each H on the CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. Each CH is connected to CH3, C2H5, and the next CH. So, again, the H on each CH would be adjacent to another H, leading to a doublet.

But the NMR shows more complex splitting. So maybe this isn't the right option either.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, each of the two middle CH groups has a CH3 and another CH3 attached. So, the structure would be:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So, each CH is connected to two CH3 groups and the next CH. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. But each CH is also connected to two CH3 groups. So, the H on the CH would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet, and perhaps the neighboring CH3 groups, but CH3 groups are on the same carbon, so their Hs would be equivalent and not split the signal further. Or would they?

Wait, no, because each CH is attached to two CH3 groups. So, the CH's H is adjacent to the CH3 groups, which have three Hs each. So, the H on CH would be next to 3 Hs (from the CH3 group) and another H (from the adjacent CH). So, the coupling would be with four Hs? No, because the CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH, so the H on CH is attached to the same carbon as the CH3. So, the H on CH is not adjacent to the CH3 Hs—those are on the same carbon, so they are equivalent and don't split each other. So, the H on CH would only couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet.

Hmm, that's not matching the given NMR data. So perhaps option C isn't the right answer.

Option A's structure: Each middle CH has a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the next CH, but also in close proximity to the C2H5 and CH3 groups' Hs, but not directly adjacent.

Wait, but the Hs on the C2H5 and CH3 are on different carbons, so the H on the CH would only couple with the H on the adjacent CH. So again, perhaps only a doublet, which doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possibility that the structure has a CH group next to a CH2 group. For example, if a CH is next to a CH2, which is next to another CH group. So the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, and also with the H on the next CH.

So, the H would first split into a triplet (from CH2), then each of those would split into a doublet (from the next CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. But the problem statement has a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Wait, so perhaps the H is coupled with three different sets of Hs. For example, a CH group next to a CH2 (two Hs), a CH3 (three Hs), and another CH (one H). So each coupling would add another split.

So, the initial split would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH), then each of those would split into a quartet (from CH3), and each of those into a triplet (from CH2). So the overall pattern would be a doublet of quartets of triplets, but the problem says a doublet of triplets of quartets. The order might vary based on the coupling constants, but the main point is that the proton is coupled to three different sets of Hs.

Which option's structure would result in such a scenario?

Looking back: Option D's structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH3.

So, the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet), and also coupled with the Hs on the CH2CH3 groups and CH3 groups.

Wait, but the CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH, so their Hs are equivalent and don't cause splitting. The CH2CH3 groups are attached to the same carbon as the CH, so their Hs are not adjacent either. So, the Hs on the CH2CH3 are two Hs on a CH2 group, but that's not adjacent to the CH's H. So, the H on the CH would only couple with the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet, not a more complex pattern.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something in the structure analysis.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a branching that causes the H to be adjacent to multiple different groups. For example, a CH group connected to a CH2CH2 group and another CH group, each with their own Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a bridge or a ring structure, but none of the options seem to suggest that.

Another thought: the presence of multiple neighboring CH groups could lead to complex splitting. For example, if a CH is connected to two other CH groups, each with their own Hs.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, each middle CH has a C2H5 and a CH3 attached. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. Additionally, each CH is connected to a C2H5 group, which has two Hs on the adjacent carbon. Wait, but those Hs are on a different carbon, so they wouldn't directly couple with the CH's H.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the quartet and triplet. A quartet suggests coupling with three Hs. Where would that come from in the structure?

If a H is next to a CH2 group (two Hs), then a triplet. If it's next to a CH3 group (three Hs), then a quartet. But the H would need to be adjacent to both a CH2 and a CH3 group to have both splits.

Which option has a CH group next to both CH2 and CH3 groups?

Looking at option D: Each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH3. Wait, but CH2CH3 is a propyl group? No, CH2CH3 is ethyl. So CH2CH3 is a substituent, but the H on the CH would not be adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl group. Only the CH3 group is attached to the same carbon as the CH. So, the CH's H is only adjacent to the CH3 group's Hs if they are on the same carbon, which they are not.

Wait, no, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the CH is attached to CH2CH3 (ethyl) and CH3. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH, and perhaps the ethyl group's Hs are on the adjacent CH2. But those Hs are on a different carbon, so would they be coupled?

Protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal) can couple if they are on adjacent carbons, but the coupling is usually weaker than geminal or diastereotopic. So, in this case, the H on the CH would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, which is a doublet. But what about the Hs on the ethyl group? The ethyl group is attached to the same CH, so the Hs on the ethyl are on the next carbon. So, the H on the CH would not be adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl group. So, no coupling there.

Hmm. So perhaps the H on the CH only couples with the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet. But the NMR shows a more complex splitting pattern. So maybe option D isn't the right answer.

Wait, what about option A? Its structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Each middle CH has a C2H5 and a CH3 attached. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH. Additionally, each CH is attached to an ethyl group, which has Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, the H on the CH is next to the ethyl group's CH2, which has two Hs. So, the H on the CH would couple with both the adjacent CH's H (doublet) and the ethyl group's two Hs (triplet). So, the splitting would first be a doublet (from the adjacent CH), and each of those would split into a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2), resulting in a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps there's another layer of coupling. Where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is next to another CH group, leading to further coupling. But in option A, the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, each ethyl group is attached to the CH, but the CH2 of the ethyl is connected to a CH3. So, the ethyl group is -CH2CH3. The Hs on the CH2 of the ethyl would be adjacent to the CH's H. So, the CH's H would couple with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet. Additionally, it would couple with the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet. And perhaps there's another coupling.

Wait, but the ethyl's CH2 is connected to the CH, so the H on the CH is adjacent to the ethyl's CH2's Hs. So, the H on the CH would experience coupling with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and also with the adjacent CH's H (doublet). So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets, which fits part of the data.

But the NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps there's another coupling. Where would that come from?

Hmm, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is connected to another CH or something else. Wait, no, in the structure of option A, the ethyl is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is connected to the CH and a CH3. So the Hs on the ethyl's CH2 are adjacent to the CH's H, leading to a triplet for the CH's H from that coupling.

But then the CH's H is also adjacent to the other CH's H, leading to a doublet. So the overall splitting is a doublet of triplets.

But the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that would require another coupling. Where would that come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH's H is also coupled with another set of Hs, such as from a CH3 group attached elsewhere. But in option A, the CH is attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. The CH3's Hs are on the same carbon as the CH's H, so they don't cause splitting. The C2H5's Hs are on the adjacent CH2, which is connected to the CH. So, maybe the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet, the adjacent CH's H leading to a doublet, and perhaps another coupling with another group.

Alternatively, maybe the CH is also next to a CH2 group that's part of the main chain. Let me think about option A's structure again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

The two middle CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and a CH3. The CH2COOH is at the end.

So, each CH's H is adjacent to the CH2COOH's CH2 group. The CH2COOH has two Hs, right? So, the H on the CH would also couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, that's another coupling.

So, the H on the CH is coupled with:

1. The adjacent CH's H → doublet.

2. The two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (C2H5) → triplet.

3. The two Hs on the CH2COOH group → triplet.

Wait, but that would be three different couplings. So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2COOH) of triplet (from ethyl CH2) of doublet (from adjacent CH). Or any order. So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets of triplets, which doesn't exactly match the given data. But the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2COOH is connected to another CH group, but no, the structure is CH2COOH. So it's a CH2 connected to COOH.

Wait, maybe my approach isn't working. Let me think of another angle. The FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is carbonyl. So, the compound is a carboxylic acid, as the O-H is present.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl Hs suggests no double bonds, so it's a saturated compound.

Looking at the options, all have COOH at the end, so that's correct.

The NMR splitting patterns suggest that the Hs are in a complex environment with multiple neighboring Hs, possibly from different substituents.

Perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Because each CH has a C2H5 and a CH3, and the CH2COOH group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that leads to the quartet part.

Another idea: the CH2COOH group has two Hs. So, the H on the CH would be coupled with those two Hs, leading to a triplet. The H on the CH is also coupled with the H on the adjacent CH (doublet), and perhaps with the Hs on the C2H5 group (which would be two Hs on the CH2 of the ethyl). So, that would be another triplet.

So, the H on the CH would first couple with the adjacent CH's H (doublet), then each of those would be split by the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and each of those would be split by the two Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets. But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches. And another signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps that's another proton in the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the option where the H is coupled with three different sets of Hs: one with two Hs (triplet), another with three Hs (quartet), and another with one H (doublet).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this case, the two middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet), and also connected to the CH2CH3 group, which has two Hs. So, the H on the CH would also couple with the two Hs on the CH2CH3, leading to a triplet. So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2CH3 group's Hs are on the adjacent carbon, leading to coupling. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH2CH3's two Hs. So, the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the CH2CH3 (triplet), and with the adjacent CH's H (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But again, not matching the quartet part.

Wait, perhaps in option D, each CH group is attached to a CH2CH3. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH2CH3's Hs. The CH2CH3 has two Hs, so the H on the CH would couple with them, giving a triplet. Also, the H is adjacent to the other CH's H, giving a doublet. So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data has a quartet in the splitting. Where would that come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the H is also adjacent to a CH3 group on the same carbon. Wait, the CH3 is on the same carbon as the CH, so their Hs would be equivalent and not split the signal.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of signals in the NMR.

Each option has different substituents. Option D has two CH groups each attached to a CH2CH3 and CH3. So, perhaps the NMR would show more signals due to the different environments.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again about option A's structure:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

Each middle CH has a C2H5 and a CH3. So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the other CH's H (doublet), and also adjacent to the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), and perhaps the two Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of triplets. That would match one of the signals in the problem.

But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps another H in the molecule is coupled with three Hs (quartet) and two Hs (triplet) and one H (doublet).

Alternatively, maybe the Hs on the ethyl groups are causing the quartet. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the number of unique H environments in each option.

Option D: There are two CH groups each attached to a CH2CH3 and CH3. Are these CH groups equivalent? If the molecule is symmetric, then the two CH groups would be equivalent, leading to a single peak for their Hs. But if the substituents are different, they might not be. Wait, in option D, each CH is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3. Are those substituents making the two CH groups equivalent? If the substituents are in a symmetrical position, then yes. For example, if the two CH groups are symmetrically attached to the COOH group, then their Hs would be equivalent, leading to a single peak.

But in the NMR, the splitting suggests that each H is in a unique environment, so perhaps the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the two CH groups are not equivalent, leading to two different peaks, each with their own splitting.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thing: the problem says that in the 1H NMR, none of the peaks correspond to vinyl Hs. So, all Hs are in single bonds. So, the structure is fully saturated.

Putting all this together, I think option A might be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. The strong peak at 1700 is a carbonyl, which in this case is a carboxylic acid.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl Hs confirms it's a saturated compound.

The splitting patterns suggest complex coupling. So, the correct structure must have a proton that is coupled with multiple different sets of Hs.

Option A: Each middle CH is attached to a C2H5 and a CH3. The Hs on the CH would couple with the adjacent CH's H (doublet), the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the two Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets of doublets, but the problem has a quartet in the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to another CH group, leading to a quartet. But I don't think that's the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. These observations suggest the compound is a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum indicates the absence of vinyl hydrogens, ruling out any double bonds, and shows complex splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest protons in a complex environment with multiple coupling interactions.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure consists of two middle CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a C₂H₅ (ethyl) group, followed by a CH₂COOH group.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet), the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), and the two Hs on the CH₂COOH group (triplet). This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches one of the signals in the NMR data.

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure has two middle CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a C₂H₅ group, with a COOH group at the end.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet). This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets, which does not fully match the given NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure consists of two middle CH groups, each attached to two CH₃ groups, followed by a CH₂COOH group.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet). However, the CH₃ groups on the same carbon do not cause further splitting due to equivalence. This results in a simpler splitting pattern (doublet), which does not match the complex splitting in the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure has two middle CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) group, with a COOH group at the end.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet). This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets, which does not fully match the given NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Option A provides the best match to the NMR data. The splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of triplets aligns with the described signals, and the structure is consistent with the FTIR data indicating a carboxylic acid. The other options fail to account for the observed splitting patterns or do not match the functional group data.
