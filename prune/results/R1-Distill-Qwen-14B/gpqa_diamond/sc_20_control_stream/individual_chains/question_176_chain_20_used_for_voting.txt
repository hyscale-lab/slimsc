Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves the measurement of two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The system's state at time t is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a minute—I think I should normalize that state vector because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized so that the sum of the squares of the absolute values equals 1.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization. Oh, but when you measure, you use the state as is, unless it's already normalized. So perhaps I should proceed without normalizing because the question might not require it. Or maybe the measurement process takes care of it. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's proceed.

The problem is about measuring P and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the order is important: first measure P, then Q. So I need to find the probability that when I measure P, I get 0, and then, given that outcome, measure Q and get -1.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P and Q.

Operator P's matrix is given as:

Row 1: 0 , 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but maybe there's an easier way. Let me think about the properties of P. Looking at the structure, perhaps P has certain symmetries.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the eigenvalues by finding the characteristic equation |P - λI|=0.

The characteristic equation for a 3x3 matrix is a bit involved, but let me try.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -λ]

The determinant of this matrix is... let me compute it.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be done using expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.

So: -λ * det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] - (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] + 0 * something.

Wait, the third term is zero because the element is 0. So only the first two terms matter.

First term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ) ]

= - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ]

= - (1/√2) * (-λ /√2) )

= - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) 

Wait, let me compute that step by step. The minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0, -λ]

Wait wait, no. Wait, when expanding, the minor for position (1,2) is the determinant of the matrix you get after removing row 1 and column 2. So the matrix would be:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2, ...], but after removing column 2, we have rows:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2] — wait, no, the rows are [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] (originally row 2), and row 3 is [0, 1/√2, 0]. So when column 2 is removed, the minor matrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, -lambda]

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The minor matrix for element (1,2) is:

Rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So row 2 is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], so columns 1 and 3 are 1/√2 and 1/√2.

Row 3 is [0, 1/√2, 0], so columns 1 and 3 are 0 and 0.

Wait, so the minor matrix is:

[ [1/√2, 1/√2],
  [0, 0] ]

The determinant of this is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 0) ) = 0.

So the second term in the expansion is (1/√2) multiplied by determinant, but with a sign based on the position.

Wait, but the expansion formula is:

det(A) = a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13,

where Mij is the minor for element aij.

So the second term is - a12 * M12.

Wait, a12 is 1/sqrt(2), and M12 is the determinant of the minor matrix.

So the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ determinant of the minor ].

But the minor matrix here is as I wrote: first row from row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] — no, wait, the minor is when you remove row 1 and column 2. So the minor matrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2] (columns 1 and 3)
Row 3: [0, 0] (columns 1 and 3)

So determinant is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) ) = 0.

So the second term is - (1/√2) * 0 = 0.

So overall, the determinant is:

-λ [ λ² - 1/2 ] + 0 = -λ (λ² - 1/2 )

Set this equal to zero for the characteristic equation:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) = 0

So the solutions are λ = 0, and λ^2 = 1/2 → λ = ±1/√2.

Wait, that can't be right because 1/√2 is approximately 0.707. So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1/√2, and -1/√2.

Wait, but the problem mentions that when measuring P, the outcome is 0. So the state would collapse into the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So first, let's find the eigenvectors for P when λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0 (again, same as row 1).

So the conditions are v2=0, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is a scalar.

We can choose a=1, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T. Or any scalar multiple; the direction matters, not the magnitude.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. When we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector for 0.

So first, we need to normalize the eigenvector. The eigenvector is [1, 0, -1], which has a norm squared of 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1].

The amplitude is the inner product of |ψ> with this normalized eigenvector.

So let's compute the inner product:

< v | ψ > = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · [ -1, 2, 1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1*(-1)) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) (-2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

The probability is the square of the amplitude's magnitude: | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2.

Wait a minute, that can't be. The probability can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the state |ψ> is not normalized. Let me check.

The initial state vector is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, to compute the probability, I should take the inner product of the normalized |ψ> with the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, perhaps I didn't normalize |ψ> first. Let me correct that.

The normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ] · (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ] 

= (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ]

= (1)/(sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ]

= (1)/(2*sqrt(3)) * (-2) 

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= -1/sqrt(3)

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), the probability is 1/3. So the probability for P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but the initial state is [-1,2,1]^T. Let me make sure I normalized correctly. Yes, the norm is sqrt(6), so each component is divided by sqrt(6).

So that part seems correct.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0, which is [1,0,-1]^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1].

So the new state after measurement is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]^T.

Now, the next measurement is Q. Let me look at operator Q.

Operator Q is given as a diagonal matrix:

Row 1: 1, 0, 0

Row 2: 0, 0, 0

Row 3: 0, 0, -1

So Q is diagonal, which makes eigenvalues easy: the diagonal entries are 1, 0, -1.

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

For 1: [1,0,0]^T

For 0: any vector in the y-direction, like [0,1,0]^T

For -1: [0,0,1]^T

So now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state is |Q_state> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting -1 for Q.

So the outcome -1 corresponds to the eigenvector [0,0,1]^T.

So the amplitude is the inner product of |Q_state> with the normalized eigenvector for Q=-1.

The normalized eigenvector is [0,0,1]^T.

The amplitude is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1] · [0,0,1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) = -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait—am I allowed to take the inner product like that? Because the state after P's measurement is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]. So when you measure Q, you expand this state in the basis of Q's eigenvectors.

But since Q is diagonal, the basis is already the standard basis.

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) |1> + 0 |2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |3>.

So the component in the Q=-1 eigenspace is (-1/sqrt(2)).

The probability is | -1/sqrt(2) |^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of Q being -1 is 1/2.

Wait, but the question asks for the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1.

So the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities only if the measurements are independent, which they are not because the second measurement is made on the state after the first measurement.

Wait, no, the process is:

1. Measure P. Probability of 0 is 1/3.

2. If P=0, the state becomes |v> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]^T.

3. Measure Q on this state. The probability of getting -1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct because the probabilities are conditional. The first probability is 1/3, and given that, the second is 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]^T. So when you measure Q, the probability to get -1 is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient in the state for the eigenvalue -1.

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) |1> + 0 |2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |3>.

The component for Q=-1 is |3>, which in this state has a coefficient of -1/sqrt(2).

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So yes, 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system with the initial state \(|\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T\). The goal is to find the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in successive measurements.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The norm of the initial state is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Solving for the eigenvalues of \( P \), the characteristic equation is:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalization gives:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product of \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |v_0\rangle \):

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 + 0 - 1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |v_0\rangle \), normalized as:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors:

\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 6: Probability of \( Q = -1 \)
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product of \( |v_0\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
P(Q=-1) = |\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 7: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
