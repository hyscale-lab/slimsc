Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and jotting down all the given information.

Alright, the problem says that there are three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. The question is about finding the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth's. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Also, the mass ratios might come into play for other aspects, but since the question is about orbital period, maybe Kepler's laws are more relevant here.

Let me list out the given ratios:

- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2: 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = T1 / 1.4
- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3: 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2: 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15 → M2 = M1 / 1.15
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3: 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35 → M3 = M2 / 1.35

Wait, but in Kepler's third law, the masses of the planets don't directly affect the orbital period, right? Because Kepler's law for planets orbiting a star (assuming the star's mass is much larger than the planets) is based on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Since all three planets orbit the same star, the star's mass would be the same for all, so Kepler's law would relate the period and semi-major axis.

Wait, but wait. The TTV method detects planets based on their gravitational interactions. But for Kepler's third law, as applied here, the formula is (P^2) = (4π²/G(M)) * a^3, where M is the mass of the star. So for each planet, P^2 is proportional to a^3/(M). But since the star's mass M is the same for all three, the ratio of periods would depend on the cube root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.

So the key is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet3 to Planet1, and then take the cube root multiplied by some factor.

But how do I find the semi-major axes? Well, the equilibrium temperature might help there. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity,
- a is the albedo,
- D is the distance (semi-major axis) from the star,
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three have the same albedo (0.3), and assuming the star's luminosity L is the same for all, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of D. Because T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). Therefore, D (semi-major axis) is proportional to 1/T^2.

So for each planet, D1, D2, D3 are proportional to 1/(T1^2), 1/(T2^2), 1/(T3^2).

So, the ratio D3/D1 would be (T1^2)/(T3^2). Wait, let me think again.

Wait, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D) → D ∝ (1/T)^2. So D is proportional to 1/T². So if T increases, D decreases.

So, D3 = (T_planet3) factor relative to T_planet1's D.

Wait, but let's compute the ratio between the planets.

Given that T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = 0.714 T1

Then, T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3 = (0.714 T1) / 2.3 → T3 = approx (0.714 / 2.3) T1 ≈ 0.31 T1.

So T3 is about 0.31 times T1.

Wait, let me compute that exact. 0.714 divided by 2.3 is about 0.3104. So yes, T3 ≈ 0.31 T1.

So the temperatures are T1, T2=0.714 T1, T3=0.31 T1.

Now, the semi-major axes are proportional to 1/T².

So D1 ∝ 1/(T1)^2, D2 ∝ 1/(T2)^2 = 1/(0.714 T1)^2 = 1/(0.714² T1²) ≈ 1/(0.51 T1²).

Similarly, D3 ∝ 1/(0.31 T1)^2 = 1/(0.0961 T1²).

So the ratio D3/D1 is (1/(0.0961 T1²)) / (1/T1²) ) = 1/0.0961 ≈ 10.404.

So D3 is about 10.4 times D1.

But wait, Kepler's third law says that (P^2) ∝ a^3/(M_star). Since M_star is the same for all, the ratio of periods squared is the ratio of a^3.

So (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We've found D3/D1 ≈ 10.4, so (10.4)^(3/2) is the factor.

Calculating 10.4^(3/2). Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.4) is around 3.2248. Then, 3.2248^3 is 3.2248 * 3.2248 = approx 10.39 (since 3.2^2 is 10.24), then 10.39 * 3.2248 ≈ 33.5. Because 10 * 3.2248 is 32.248, plus 0.39 *3.2248≈1.22, so total around 33.47.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.47, so about 33.5 times. Looking at the options, option D is 33.4, which is the closest.

But wait, let me double-check the steps because sometimes it's easy to get mixed up in the ratios.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula again: T = [ (L (1 - a) )/(16πσ D²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to 1/(D^(1/2)). So D is proportional to 1/T².

So the semi-major axes are proportional to 1/T². So D3/D1 = (T1²)/(T3²) → because D is proportional to 1/T², so D3/D1 = (1/(T3²)) / (1/(T1²)) ) = (T1²)/(T3²).

Wait, that's an important point. Let me recast the ratios correctly.

Given D ∝ 1/T² → D3 / D1 = (1/T3²) / (1/T1²) ) = T1² / T3².

So D3/D1 = (T1 / T3 )².

Wait, earlier I said that D3/D1 = (T1^2)/(T3^2), but that's the same as (T1/T3)^2. So in our case, T3 is 0.31 T1 → T1/T3 = 1/0.31 ≈ 3.2258.

So (T1/T3)^2 = (3.2258)^2 ≈ 10.404.

So D3 is 10.4 times D1.

Then, Kepler's third law says that (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → because P^2 ∝ D^3. So (P3/P1)^2 = (10.4)^3 → (10.4)^3 is 10.4 * 10.4 = 108.16, multiplied by 10.4 → 108.16 *10 = 1081.6, 108.16 *0.4=43.264 → total 1124.864. So (P3/P1)^2 ≈ 1124.864 → P3/P1 ≈ sqrt(1124.864) ≈ 33.54.

Which is roughly 33.5, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem gives the mass ratios, but in my calculation, I didn't use them. Why?

Because when applying Kepler's third law, if the planets are orbiting the same star, the period depends on the mass of the star. Because the formula is P² = (4π² G M_star )^-1 * a³ (M_planet + M_star) ≈ a³/(G M_star). Since planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass, their effect is negligible. So the mass ratios between the planets (M1, M2, M3) don't affect the orbital periods because the periods are determined mainly by the star's mass and the semi-major axis.

So the mass ratios given in the problem are probably a red herring, or perhaps for some other part of the problem. But in this case, they're not needed for calculating the orbital period ratio based on Kepler's law.

So the answer should be option D, ~33.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio between the planets is provided, and the albedo is the same for all three planets, so the semi-major axis can be derived from the equilibrium temperature.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( D \), given by:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]

Thus, \( D \propto \frac{1}{T^2} \). Using the given temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( T_2 = 0.714 T_1 \),
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( T_3 = \frac{T_2}{2.3} = \frac{0.714 T_1}{2.3} \approx 0.31 T_1 \).

The semi-major axes are proportional to \( 1 / T^2 \), so:
\[
\frac{D_3}{D_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.31}\right)^2 \approx 10.4
\]

### Step 2: Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( D \):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.4 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.4)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.4} \approx 3.2248 \). Then:
\[
(10.4)^{3/2} = (3.2248)^3 \approx 33.5
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.5 times larger than that of Planet1. The closest option is:

- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2: 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = T1 / 1.4
- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3: 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2: 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15 → M2 = M1 / 1.15
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3: 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35 → M3 = M2 / 1.35

Wait, but in Kepler's third law, the masses of the planets don't directly affect the orbital period, right? Because Kepler's law for planets orbiting a star (assuming the star's mass is much larger than the planets) is based on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Since all three planets orbit the same star, the star's mass would be the same for all, so Kepler's law would relate the period and semi-major axis.

Wait, but wait. The TTV method detects planets based on their gravitational interactions. But for Kepler's third law, as applied here, the formula is (P^2) = (4π²/G(M)) * a^3, where M is the mass of the star. So for each planet, P^2 is proportional to a^3/(M). But since the star's mass M is the same for all three, the ratio of periods would depend on the cube root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.

So the key is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet3 to Planet1, and then take the cube root multiplied by some factor.

But how do I find the semi-major axes? Well, the equilibrium temperature might help there. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity,
- a is the albedo,
- D is the distance (semi-major axis) from the star,
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three have the same albedo (0.3), and assuming the star's luminosity L is the same for all, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of D. Because T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). Therefore, D (semi-major axis) is proportional to 1/T^2.

So for each planet, D1, D2, D3 are proportional to 1/(T1^2), 1/(T2^2), 1/(T3^2).

So, the ratio D3/D1 would be (T1^2)/(T3^2). Wait, let me think again.

Wait, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D) → D ∝ (1/T)^2. So D is proportional to 1/T². So if T increases, D decreases.

So, D3 = (T_planet3) factor relative to T_planet1's D.

Wait, but let's compute the ratio between the planets.

Given that T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = 0.714 T1

Then, T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3 = (0.714 T1) / 2.3 → T3 = approx (0.714 / 2.3) T1 ≈ 0.31 T1.

So T3 is about 0.31 times T1.

Wait, let me compute that exact. 0.714 divided by 2.3 is about 0.3104. So yes, T3 ≈ 0.31 T1.

So the temperatures are T1, T2=0.714 T1, T3=0.31 T1.

Now, the semi-major axes are proportional to 1/T².

So D1 ∝ 1/(T1)^2, D2 ∝ 1/(T2)^2 = 1/(0.714 T1)^2 = 1/(0.714² T1²) ≈ 1/(0.51 T1²).

Similarly, D3 ∝ 1/(0.31 T1)^2 = 1/(0.0961 T1²).

So the ratio D3/D1 is (1/(0.0961 T1²)) / (1/T1²) ) = 1/0.0961 ≈ 10.404.

So D3 is about 10.4 times D1.

But wait, Kepler's third law says that (P^2) ∝ a^3/(M_star). Since M_star is the same for all, the ratio of periods squared is the ratio of a^3.

So (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We've found D3/D1 ≈ 10.4, so (10.4)^(3/2) is the factor.

Calculating 10.4^(3/2). Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.4) is around 3.2248. Then, 3.2248^3 is 3.2248 * 3.2248 = approx 10.39 (since 3.2^2 is 10.24), then 10.39 * 3.2248 ≈ 33.5. Because 10 * 3.2248 is 32.248, plus 0.39 *3.2248≈1.22, so total around 33.47.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.47, so about 33.5 times. Looking at the options, option D is 33.4, which is the closest.

But wait, let me double-check the steps because sometimes it's easy to get mixed up in the ratios.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula again: T = [ (L (1 - a) )/(16πσ D²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to 1/(D^(1/2)). So D is proportional to 1/T².

So the semi-major axes are proportional to 1/T². So D3/D1 = (T1²)/(T3²) → because D is proportional to 1/T², so D3/D1 = (1/(T3²)) / (1/(T1²)) ) = (T1²)/(T3²).

Wait, that's an important point. Let me recast the ratios correctly.

Given D ∝ 1/T² → D3 / D1 = (1/T3²) / (1/T1²) ) = T1² / T3².

So D3/D1 = (T1 / T3 )².

Wait, earlier I said that D3/D1 = (T1^2)/(T3^2), but that's the same as (T1/T3)^2. So in our case, T3 is 0.31 T1 → T1/T3 = 1/0.31 ≈ 3.2258.

So (T1/T3)^2 = (3.2258)^2 ≈ 10.404.

So D3 is 10.4 times D1.

Then, Kepler's third law says that (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → because P^2 ∝ D^3. So (P3/P1)^2 = (10.4)^3 → (10.4)^3 is 10.4 * 10.4 = 108.16, multiplied by 10.4 → 108.16 *10 = 1081.6, 108.16 *0.4=43.264 → total 1124.864. So (P3/P1)^2 ≈ 1124.864 → P3/P1 ≈ sqrt(1124.864) ≈ 33.54.

Which is roughly 33.5, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem gives the mass ratios, but in my calculation, I didn't use them. Why?

Because when applying Kepler's third law, if the planets are orbiting the same star, the period depends on the mass of the star. Because the formula is P² = (4π² G M_star )^-1 * a³ (M_planet + M_star) ≈ a³/(G M_star). Since planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass, their effect is negligible. So the mass ratios between the planets (M1, M2, M3) don't affect the orbital periods because the periods are determined mainly by the star's mass and the semi-major axis.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( D \), given by:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]

Thus, \( D \propto \frac{1}{T^2} \). Using the given temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( T_2 = 0.714 T_1 \),
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( T_3 = \frac{T_2}{2.3} = \frac{0.714 T_1}{2.3} \approx 0.31 T_1 \).

The semi-major axes are proportional to \( 1 / T^2 \), so:
\[
\frac{D_3}{D_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.31}\right)^2 \approx 10.4
\]

### Step 2: Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( D \):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.4 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.4)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.4} \approx 3.2248 \). Then:
\[
(10.4)^{3/2} = (3.2248)^3 \approx 33.5
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.5 times larger than that of Planet1. The closest option is:
