Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, but it's a bit tricky. Let me read through the question again and see what I can figure out.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions with various substances labeled A through H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I remember that these are part of group theory in chemistry, which is used to classify the symmetry of molecules.

Let me break down the reactions step by step to deduce what each substance could be.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Eight equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is something that reacts in an 8:1 molar ratio with A. I'm thinking that maybe A is an element, and B is a diatomic gas. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2), but how? Wait, sodium and chlorine would react in a 1:1 ratio, so that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. Wait, another thought: maybe A is something like aluminum and B is something like fluorine? Or perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with a halogen? Wait, but the product C is bright red, which makes me think of something like ruby-colored compounds. Oh! Maybe sulfur? Sulfur is bright yellow, but sometimes it can have red allotropes. Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or F2. Wait, another approach: if C is formed by A and B, and later C reacts with D, perhaps C is a salt.

Wait, thinking about the reactions further.

C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C is in the presence of water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. For example, if C is a sulfide, reacting with water might produce a metal hydroxide, H2S (which is a weak acid?), but wait, H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, maybe it reacts to form NH3 (a weak acid, but maybe not, since NH3 is a base). Or if C is a carbonate, reacting with water might produce CO2 (acid) and OH- or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the products when C reacts with water. Two acids F and G are formed, with F being strong. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4. Weak acids could be something like H2S, HCN, CH3COOH, etc.

Another angle: when C reacts with D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Wait, but H is the product of D and B in a 1:1 ratio. So D and B are gases, perhaps, and react to form a liquid solvent H.

Wait, what gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Maybe H2O? Because H2O is a solvent, but how? Let me think: if B is H2 and D is O2, then they react in a 2:1 ratio (2H2 + O2 → 2H2O), but that's not 1:1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else, but then B wouldn't be a gas necessarily. Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl? But then their reaction in 1:1 ratio would be NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something that makes a solvent. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to outline possible reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent)

So, perhaps starting with reaction 4. Since H is a solvent, and B and D are gases reacting 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. What gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Let's think: H2O is a solvent, but it's formed from H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. So maybe another solvent. How about ethanol? No, because that would require a more complex reaction. Wait, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), but how? If B and D are CO and H2, maybe in the presence of a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps H is another solvent. Wait, what about H being NH3? But NH3 is a gas at certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe H is something like acetone, but that probably doesn't form from a 1:1 ratio of two gases. Or perhaps H is something like HCl? But HCl is a gas. Wait, maybe H is not the solvent itself but another product.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 4 is producing H as a solvent, but I'm not seeing it immediately. Let me think about reaction 3: when C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C is likely a salt, perhaps a sulfide or something that reacts with water to produce a metal hydroxide and an acid.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water might not produce much, unless it's a more reactive sulfide. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then adding water would produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2. But wait, NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, reacting with water doesn't produce much. So perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. For instance, if C is Na2SO3, reacting with water might not change much. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Let me think again about reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). What could A and B be? 8 equivalents suggests a high ratio. For example, perhaps A is sulfur (S8) and B is something else. Wait, no, sulfur is a bright yellow solid. Wait, maybe A is iron, and B is something else. Alternatively, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, but then the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl2 for 2 equivalents of Na, which doesn't fit the 8:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum (Al) and B is Cl2. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio (2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3). Not an 8:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is FeO, and B is Cl2. Then 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 1 mole of FeO? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a combustion reaction. For example, solid carbon (A) reacting with O2 (B) to form CO2. But the product wouldn't be bright red. Wait, maybe A is a metal like copper, and B is sulfur vapor. Copper and sulfur react to form Cu2S, which is black, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. Wait, silver and chlorine react in a 1:1 ratio, but again, not 8:1.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product C. C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Ruby-colored compounds, like some transition metal complexes. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe something like Fe(OH)3 is reddish. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide with a red color. Or maybe it's a product of a metal and a halogen. Wait, perhaps C is a compound with a lot of halogens, like a polyhalide.

Alternatively, maybe C is a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, but some other manganese compounds can be colored. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another chromium compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitro compound. But I don't recall nitro compounds being bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a diazonium salt? Those are often brightly colored, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that's usually black. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound containing the element vanadium in a certain oxidation state. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a coordination complex. For example, [Fe(CN)6]^3- is yellow, but I'm not sure about red.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reactions in a different way. Let's consider reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But then F would be a strong acid, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then H2O would react to form NH3 (weak base, not acid) and Mg(OH)2. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't change much. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but again, that may not produce acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. Na2SO3 + H2O → NaOH + H2SO3. Wait, H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, which is a weak acid. But then F would be a strong acid, but this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride of a strong base. For example, NaCl is a neutral salt. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and weak base. For example, NH4Cl reacts with water to produce HCl (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). But in that reaction, C would be NH4Cl. Then A would be NH4+ (but it's not a solid). So maybe A is a metal, and C is its chloride.

Wait, suppose A is Mg, and C is MgCl2. Then when MgCl2 reacts with water, it doesn't produce Mg and an acid. It just stays as MgCl2, a neutral salt. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a hydroxide. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about reaction 4 again: B + D → H (solvent). If H is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O, but how would that form from B and D? Well, if B is H2 and D is O2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Another possibility: H is ethanol. But then the reaction would require more complex reactants. Alternatively, H is NH3, but that's a gas, not a liquid.

Wait, maybe B and D are gases that form a liquid solvent when they react. Maybe H is a chlorinated compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule. Hmm, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, let me try to approach this with possible substances for E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, and it's extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous substances include things like sarin gas, cyanide, heavy metals, but perhaps in this context, it's something like a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.

If E is something like phosgene (but that's a stretch), or perhaps a highly oxidizing substance. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but then what would cause that?

Wait, another thought: if E is something like sulfur hexafluoride, but that's inert. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe E is a metal cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of C and D, where D is a halogen. So if C is a metal sulfide and D is a halogen, maybe E is a metal halide with some other product.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to hypothesize possible substances.

Let me try to make some assumptions. Let's say that A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine gas (Cl2). Then reaction 1 would be Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But the molar ratio would be 2 Na : Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's a 1:1 ratio, but the question says 8 equivalents of B. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum and B is Cl2. 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio, which is not 8:1.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is FeO. Then B could be Cl2. The reaction would be FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3 + OCl2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe3O4 and B is Cl2. Then the reaction could produce FeCl3. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas that requires 8 moles for each mole of A. Wait, 8 equivalents of B. That suggests 8 moles of B per mole of A. So, for example, if A is Na, and B is F2, then 2 Na + F2 → 2 NaF. That's a 2:1 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe A is a metal and B is a polyatomic ion. For example, if B is a triatomic gas like O3, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe B is something like SO3, but that's a liquid or solid under standard conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with B. For example, if A is a metal with a +1 charge and B is a diatomic -1 ion. But not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something like 8 B + A → 4 C. Wait, but the product is C, which is bright red. Maybe if A is carbon (C), and B is something like O2. Then 8 O2 + C → CO or CO2? But that's not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a reaction where a solid metal reacts with a diatomic gas in an 8:1 ratio. Wait, 8 equivalents of B. So moles of B is 8 times moles of A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. So the reaction would be A +8 B → products.

Let me think about metals reacting with diatomic gases:

For example, magnesium reacts with bromine in a 1:1 ratio: Mg + Br2 → MgBr2. Not 8:1.

Aluminum and chlorine: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. 3/2 ratio.

Sodium and chlorine: 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. 1:0.5 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is not a simple ionic formation. Maybe it's a more complex reaction, like a combustion reaction. For example, sulfur (S8) burning in O2 to form SO2 or SO3. S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. That would fit an 8:1 ratio of O2 to S. So A would be S8, B would be O2, and C would be SO2. But SO2 is a gas, not a solid. Also, SO2 isn't bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas that combines with it in an 8:1 ratio. For example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2, but the reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. 3/2 ratio again.

Wait, perhaps it's a redox reaction where A is oxidized and B is reduced. For example, if B is a halogen like F2, and A is a metal. Let me think: if A is copper (Cu), and B is F2. The reaction would be 2 Cu + 4 F2 → 2 CuF4. But I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2. But in any case, I don't think that leads to a bright red product.

Wait, maybe C is a compound of vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but maybe another vanadium compound is red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of manganese in a certain oxidation state. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a transition metal oxide. For example, Mn2O7 is a dark brown crystalline solid, but not bright red.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G a weak. So if C is a salt that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and a weak one, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate of a metal. Wait, not sure.

Let me think of a specific example. Suppose C is NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it stays as NaNO3. No, that's neutral. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce much. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Again, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is not very stable) and H2S. H2S is a weak acid. Then, F would have to be something else. But Fe(OH)2 isn't very stable, and it's not a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphide, like Ca3P2. Reacting with water produces PH3 (a weak acid?) and Ca(OH)2. Not sure about the acid strengths here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid. Wait, metal oxides typically form bases when reacting with water. For example, Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH. But that produces a strong base, not an acid.

Wait, unless C is a non-metal oxide. For example, CO2 is an acidic oxide. CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak). Hmm, but that's one acid, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, NaHCO3. Reacting with water would not produce much, but perhaps if it's heated, it decomposes. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfide. Let's say C is Na2S2O3 (thiosulfate). Reacting with water might produce something else, but I'm not certain.

This is getting me stuck. Maybe I should think about E. E is produced when C reacts with D. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas or a very reactive compound. Common ones are HCN, NO, SO2, etc. Alternatively, maybe E is a heavy metal compound.

Wait, another approach: if I can figure out what H is, perhaps that will help. H is formed when B and D react in a 1:1 ratio and is a solvent. So possible solvents made from gases reacting 1:1.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. How? If B is O2 and D is H2. Then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if B is O3 and D is H2, but O3 is a triatomic gas, and that's not diatomic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B and D are gases that combine to form a liquid solvent in a 1:1 ratio. Maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from two gases? Methanol is CH3OH, which would require CO and H2 in a 1:4 ratio? Not sure.

Wait, another idea: maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O2. How would that form? From H2 and O2? But that would require a 2:1 ratio again.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should try to think of specific substances for each reaction.

Let me try again:

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red).

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A (recovered) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So when C reacts with water, it gives back A, F, and G.

So C is likely a salt that can undergo hydrolysis to produce A, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would give NaOH (strong base, not acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that gives a base and an acid, but in reaction 3, F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what if C is a metal nitrite? Like NaNO2. Reacting with water would produce NaOH and HNO2. HNO2 is a weak acid. So F would be NaOH (a strong base, not acid), which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. If C is a chloride that reacts with water to produce a strong acid. Wait, if C is something like MgCl2, which is a neutral salt. Reacting with water wouldn't produce acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. Then with water, it might not react much. Unless it's a more reactive sulfide. For example, K2S reacts with water to produce 2KOH and H2S. So, K2S + 2 H2O → 2 KOH + H2S↑. But then F would be KOH (strong base) and G would be H2S (weak acid). Then in reaction 3, F would be a base, which doesn't fit the description. So that's not it.

Wait, what if C is a sulfite, like CaSO3? Then when it reacts with water, perhaps it decomposes. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. So when it hydrolyzes, it produces a strong acid and a weak base. But in reaction 3, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Hmm, but that would require a salt that produces two acids upon hydrolysis. Which isn't common. Most salts produce either an acid and a base, or two bases, or two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce NaOH and O2. Again, a base and a gas, not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2↑. Again, a base and a weak acid (CO2 is a weak acid in water). So F would be CO2 (weak acid), G would be NaOH (strong base). Doesn't fit because F is supposed to be a strong acid.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of a different approach.

Wait, maybe C is a compound that when it reacts with D, forms E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's say D is a halogen like Cl2. So C + 2 Cl2 → E. What would E be? If C is, say, SO2, then adding Cl2 might not do much. Alternatively, if C is H2S, adding Cl2 could form S and HCl, but that's probably not extremely hazardous.

Wait, maybe E is a cyanide compound. But how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly oxidizing substance, like O3 or Cl2O. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen. For example, C is FeO, and D is Cl2. Then FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3. But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a phosgene gas, but I don't see how that would form from C and D.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. When it reacts with D (what could D be?), if D is Cl2, then FeS + Cl2 → FeCl3 + S. That's a possibility. But would that be extremely hazardous? FeCl3 is toxic but not extremely so, I think.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. How would that form? If C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of C and D being a highly reactive compound. For example, if C is NH3 and D is HCl, but that forms NH4Cl, which isn't a gas.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry of E. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

I remember that these are symmetry groups from crystallography. C2 is a 2-fold rotation axis. D4h has a four-fold rotation axis with horizontal mirror planes. D∞h has an infinite fold rotation axis (like a cylinder) with horizontal mirrors. C2v has a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Which of these are common for certain molecules? For example, D4h is the symmetry of the square planar molecule, like XeF4. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with a center of inversion, like CO2 or HCN. C2 would have a molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis, like water (but water has C2v symmetry, not C2).

Wait, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if it's a molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis and some mirror planes, it could be C2v.

But what is E? Let's suppose that E is a linear molecule, like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

But wait, if E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve gas or something like that, but I'm not sure of their structures.

Alternatively, another possibility: if E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry, but O2 is not extremely hazardous, though. Or, if E is something like phosgene (which is O=C(Cl)2), which has a planar structure, and its symmetry group would be D∞h. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas, which fits the description of E being extremely hazardous.

Phosgene has the structure O=C(Cl)2, which is linear. Its point group is D∞h because it has a center of inversion and a C∞ axis with two mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, how would E form? Let me see.

If reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. Let's say C is something that, when reacted with D, produces phosgene.

Wait, but phosgene is produced from CO and Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst, like in the reaction CO + 2 Cl2 → CCl2O (which is phosgene). So D could be Cl2, and C would be CO.

Wait, but CO is a gas, but according to reaction 1, C is a solid. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, let me reevaluate. If C is CO (gas), but reaction 1 produces C as a bright red product. CO is a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe E is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone). Ozone has a bent structure, with a symmetry group of C2v. Ozone is a toxic gas, but not extremely hazardous. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O, which is dichlorine monoxide. Cl2O has a trigonal planar structure, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group. Alternatively, Cl2O has a bent structure, which would have a C2v symmetry.

Wait, but Cl2O is not a linear molecule. So perhaps its symmetry group is C2v.

Another possibility: if E is a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, such as H2O (which has C2v symmetry). But H2O is a liquid, not a gas, and not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like NH3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, like HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas, which fits the description.

So, if E is HCN, its symmetry group would be D∞h.

But then, how does HCN form from C and D? Let's think about reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is HCN, then D must be a source of CN. But D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Wait, but reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if C is KCN, then KCN + H2O → K(OH) + HCN. So F would be KOH (strong base, not acid) and G would be HCN (weak acid). Doesn't fit because F should be a strong acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting closer.

Wait, another possibility: if E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. It's a gas, and while not extremely hazardous, it can be harmful in high concentrations. But the question says extremely hazardous, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a more dangerous gas with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like CH3CN (acetonitrile), but that's a liquid and not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like CH2Cl2, but that's a liquid and not linear.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent)

Assuming E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, perhaps like phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) or HCN.

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN.

Assuming D is H2, then C would need to be CN^- and H+? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is CO. Then CO + 2 Cl2 → CCl2O (phosgene), which is a possible reaction. But earlier I thought that C would be a solid, but CO is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a solid in reaction 1, but a gas in reaction 2. That's possible. For example, C could be FeO (solid) which reacts with Cl2 (gas) to form FeCl3 (solid), but that doesn't fit the color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a solid like MnO2, which reacts with Cl2 to form MnCl4? Not sure about the color.

Another angle: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS is a solid, which reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3 and S. But I'm not sure about the reaction products.

Wait, perhaps E is a gas with D∞h symmetry, like HCN, which is a linear molecule. So if E is HCN, then D must be something that can combine with C to form HCN. Let's say D is H2 and C is CN. But CN is a liquid under standard conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and C is CNCl. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me make an assumption: the symmetry group of E is D∞h, so the answer is option C.

But wait, another possibility: if E is a molecule with a mirror plane and a 2-fold rotation axis, like H2O2, which has C2v symmetry. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a gas, and not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like O2, which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. O2 is a gas, and while it's not extremely hazardous, maybe in the context of the question it's considered so.

If E is O2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → O2. But I'm not sure what C and D would be. Maybe C is FeO and D is O2, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or HCN.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, and considering that D∞h is the symmetry of linear molecules with a center of inversion, I think E is a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene. So the symmetry group would be D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The high molar ratio suggests A and B are likely simple substances, and C is a compound with a specific color. The bright red color hints at a transition metal complex or a compound like HCN, which is red in some forms.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This suggests E is a highly toxic or reactive molecule. Examples include HCN or phosgene (O=C(Cl)₂), both of which are linear molecules with specific symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield acids. For example, if C is HCN, hydrolysis would produce HCN (weak acid) and a strong acid like HCl.

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests H is a simple solvent like water or methanol, formed from gases reacting in a 1:1 ratio.

5. **Symmetry Group of E**: The options for molecular symmetry groups are C₂, D₄h, D∞h, and C₂v. Linear molecules like HCN or phosgene have D∞h symmetry due to their infinite-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. These molecules are consistent with the description of E being extremely hazardous.

Given the analysis, E is likely a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene, which has D∞h symmetry. This matches the description of E as extremely hazardous and aligns with the symmetry group provided in the options.

**Answer: C**

Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, but it's a bit tricky. Let me read through the question again and see what I can figure out.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions with various substances labeled A through H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I remember that these are part of group theory in chemistry, which is used to classify the symmetry of molecules.

Let me break down the reactions step by step to deduce what each substance could be.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Eight equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is something that reacts in an 8:1 molar ratio with A. I'm thinking that maybe A is an element, and B is a diatomic gas. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2), but how? Wait, sodium and chlorine would react in a 1:1 ratio, so that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. Wait, another thought: maybe A is something like aluminum and B is something like fluorine? Or perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with a halogen? Wait, but the product C is bright red, which makes me think of something like ruby-colored compounds. Oh! Maybe sulfur? Sulfur is bright yellow, but sometimes it can have red allotropes. Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or F2. Wait, another approach: if C is formed by A and B, and later C reacts with D, perhaps C is a salt.

Wait, thinking about the reactions further.

C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C is in the presence of water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. For example, if C is a sulfide, reacting with water might produce a metal hydroxide, H2S (which is a weak acid?), but wait, H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, maybe it reacts to form NH3 (a weak acid, but maybe not, since NH3 is a base). Or if C is a carbonate, reacting with water might produce CO2 (acid) and OH- or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the products when C reacts with water. Two acids F and G are formed, with F being strong. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4. Weak acids could be something like H2S, HCN, CH3COOH, etc.

Another angle: when C reacts with D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Wait, but H is the product of D and B in a 1:1 ratio. So D and B are gases, perhaps, and react to form a liquid solvent H.

Wait, what gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Maybe H2O? Because H2O is a solvent, but how? Let me think: if B is H2 and D is O2, then they react in a 2:1 ratio (2H2 + O2 → 2H2O), but that's not 1:1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else, but then B wouldn't be a gas necessarily. Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl? But then their reaction in 1:1 ratio would be NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something that makes a solvent. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to outline possible reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent)

So, perhaps starting with reaction 4. Since H is a solvent, and B and D are gases reacting 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. What gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Let's think: H2O is a solvent, but it's formed from H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. So maybe another solvent. How about ethanol? No, because that would require a more complex reaction. Wait, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), but how? If B and D are CO and H2, maybe in the presence of a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps H is another solvent. Wait, what about H being NH3? But NH3 is a gas at certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe H is something like acetone, but that probably doesn't form from a 1:1 ratio of two gases. Or perhaps H is something like HCl? But HCl is a gas. Wait, maybe H is not the solvent itself but another product.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 4 is producing H as a solvent, but I'm not seeing it immediately. Let me think about reaction 3: when C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C is likely a salt, perhaps a sulfide or something that reacts with water to produce a metal hydroxide and an acid.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water might not produce much, unless it's a more reactive sulfide. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then adding water would produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2. But wait, NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, reacting with water doesn't produce much. So perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. For instance, if C is Na2SO3, reacting with water might not change much. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Let me think again about reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). What could A and B be? 8 equivalents suggests a high ratio. For example, perhaps A is sulfur (S8) and B is something else. Wait, no, sulfur is a bright yellow solid. Wait, maybe A is iron, and B is something else. Alternatively, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, but then the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl2 for 2 equivalents of Na, which doesn't fit the 8:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum (Al) and B is Cl2. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio (2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3). Not an 8:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is FeO, and B is Cl2. Then 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 1 mole of FeO? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a combustion reaction. For example, solid carbon (A) reacting with O2 (B) to form CO2. But the product wouldn't be bright red. Wait, maybe A is a metal like copper, and B is sulfur vapor. Copper and sulfur react to form Cu2S, which is black, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. Wait, silver and chlorine react in a 1:1 ratio, but again, not 8:1.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product C. C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Ruby-colored compounds, like some transition metal complexes. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe something like Fe(OH)3 is reddish. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide with a red color. Or maybe it's a product of a metal and a halogen. Wait, perhaps C is a compound with a lot of halogens, like a polyhalide.

Alternatively, maybe C is a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, but some other manganese compounds can be colored. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another chromium compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitro compound. But I don't recall nitro compounds being bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a diazonium salt? Those are often brightly colored, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that's usually black. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound containing the element vanadium in a certain oxidation state. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a coordination complex. For example, [Fe(CN)6]^3- is yellow, but I'm not sure about red.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reactions in a different way. Let's consider reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But then F would be a strong acid, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then H2O would react to form NH3 (weak base, not acid) and Mg(OH)2. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't change much. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but again, that may not produce acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. Na2SO3 + H2O → NaOH + H2SO3. Wait, H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, which is a weak acid. But then F would be a strong acid, but this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride of a strong base. For example, NaCl is a neutral salt. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and weak base. For example, NH4Cl reacts with water to produce HCl (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). But in that reaction, C would be NH4Cl. Then A would be NH4+ (but it's not a solid). So maybe A is a metal, and C is its chloride.

Wait, suppose A is Mg, and C is MgCl2. Then when MgCl2 reacts with water, it doesn't produce Mg and an acid. It just stays as MgCl2, a neutral salt. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a hydroxide. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about reaction 4 again: B + D → H (solvent). If H is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O, but how would that form from B and D? Well, if B is H2 and D is O2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Another possibility: H is ethanol. But then the reaction would require more complex reactants. Alternatively, H is NH3, but that's a gas, not a liquid.

Wait, maybe B and D are gases that form a liquid solvent when they react. Maybe H is a chlorinated compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule. Hmm, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, let me try to approach this with possible substances for E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, and it's extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous substances include things like sarin gas, cyanide, heavy metals, but perhaps in this context, it's something like a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.

If E is something like phosgene (but that's a stretch), or perhaps a highly oxidizing substance. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but then what would cause that?

Wait, another thought: if E is something like sulfur hexafluoride, but that's inert. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe E is a metal cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of C and D, where D is a halogen. So if C is a metal sulfide and D is a halogen, maybe E is a metal halide with some other product.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to hypothesize possible substances.

Let me try to make some assumptions. Let's say that A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine gas (Cl2). Then reaction 1 would be Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But the molar ratio would be 2 Na : Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's a 1:1 ratio, but the question says 8 equivalents of B. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum and B is Cl2. 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio, which is not 8:1.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is FeO. Then B could be Cl2. The reaction would be FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3 + OCl2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe3O4 and B is Cl2. Then the reaction could produce FeCl3. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas that requires 8 moles for each mole of A. Wait, 8 equivalents of B. That suggests 8 moles of B per mole of A. So, for example, if A is Na, and B is F2, then 2 Na + F2 → 2 NaF. That's a 2:1 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe A is a metal and B is a polyatomic ion. For example, if B is a triatomic gas like O3, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe B is something like SO3, but that's a liquid or solid under standard conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with B. For example, if A is a metal with a +1 charge and B is a diatomic -1 ion. But not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something like 8 B + A → 4 C. Wait, but the product is C, which is bright red. Maybe if A is carbon (C), and B is something like O2. Then 8 O2 + C → CO or CO2? But that's not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a reaction where a solid metal reacts with a diatomic gas in an 8:1 ratio. Wait, 8 equivalents of B. So moles of B is 8 times moles of A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. So the reaction would be A +8 B → products.

Let me think about metals reacting with diatomic gases:

For example, magnesium reacts with bromine in a 1:1 ratio: Mg + Br2 → MgBr2. Not 8:1.

Aluminum and chlorine: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. 3/2 ratio.

Sodium and chlorine: 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. 1:0.5 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is not a simple ionic formation. Maybe it's a more complex reaction, like a combustion reaction. For example, sulfur (S8) burning in O2 to form SO2 or SO3. S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. That would fit an 8:1 ratio of O2 to S. So A would be S8, B would be O2, and C would be SO2. But SO2 is a gas, not a solid. Also, SO2 isn't bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas that combines with it in an 8:1 ratio. For example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2, but the reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. 3/2 ratio again.

Wait, perhaps it's a redox reaction where A is oxidized and B is reduced. For example, if B is a halogen like F2, and A is a metal. Let me think: if A is copper (Cu), and B is F2. The reaction would be 2 Cu + 4 F2 → 2 CuF4. But I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2. But in any case, I don't think that leads to a bright red product.

Wait, maybe C is a compound of vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but maybe another vanadium compound is red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of manganese in a certain oxidation state. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a transition metal oxide. For example, Mn2O7 is a dark brown crystalline solid, but not bright red.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G a weak. So if C is a salt that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and a weak one, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate of a metal. Wait, not sure.

Let me think of a specific example. Suppose C is NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it stays as NaNO3. No, that's neutral. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce much. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Again, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is not very stable) and H2S. H2S is a weak acid. Then, F would have to be something else. But Fe(OH)2 isn't very stable, and it's not a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphide, like Ca3P2. Reacting with water produces PH3 (a weak acid?) and Ca(OH)2. Not sure about the acid strengths here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid. Wait, metal oxides typically form bases when reacting with water. For example, Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH. But that produces a strong base, not an acid.

Wait, unless C is a non-metal oxide. For example, CO2 is an acidic oxide. CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak). Hmm, but that's one acid, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, NaHCO3. Reacting with water would not produce much, but perhaps if it's heated, it decomposes. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfide. Let's say C is Na2S2O3 (thiosulfate). Reacting with water might produce something else, but I'm not certain.

This is getting me stuck. Maybe I should think about E. E is produced when C reacts with D. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas or a very reactive compound. Common ones are HCN, NO, SO2, etc. Alternatively, maybe E is a heavy metal compound.

Wait, another approach: if I can figure out what H is, perhaps that will help. H is formed when B and D react in a 1:1 ratio and is a solvent. So possible solvents made from gases reacting 1:1.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. How? If B is O2 and D is H2. Then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if B is O3 and D is H2, but O3 is a triatomic gas, and that's not diatomic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B and D are gases that combine to form a liquid solvent in a 1:1 ratio. Maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from two gases? Methanol is CH3OH, which would require CO and H2 in a 1:4 ratio? Not sure.

Wait, another idea: maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O2. How would that form? From H2 and O2? But that would require a 2:1 ratio again.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should try to think of specific substances for each reaction.

Let me try again:

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red).

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A (recovered) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So when C reacts with water, it gives back A, F, and G.

So C is likely a salt that can undergo hydrolysis to produce A, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would give NaOH (strong base, not acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that gives a base and an acid, but in reaction 3, F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what if C is a metal nitrite? Like NaNO2. Reacting with water would produce NaOH and HNO2. HNO2 is a weak acid. So F would be NaOH (a strong base, not acid), which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. If C is a chloride that reacts with water to produce a strong acid. Wait, if C is something like MgCl2, which is a neutral salt. Reacting with water wouldn't produce acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. Then with water, it might not react much. Unless it's a more reactive sulfide. For example, K2S reacts with water to produce 2KOH and H2S. So, K2S + 2 H2O → 2 KOH + H2S↑. But then F would be KOH (strong base) and G would be H2S (weak acid). Then in reaction 3, F would be a base, which doesn't fit the description. So that's not it.

Wait, what if C is a sulfite, like CaSO3? Then when it reacts with water, perhaps it decomposes. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. So when it hydrolyzes, it produces a strong acid and a weak base. But in reaction 3, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Hmm, but that would require a salt that produces two acids upon hydrolysis. Which isn't common. Most salts produce either an acid and a base, or two bases, or two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce NaOH and O2. Again, a base and a gas, not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2↑. Again, a base and a weak acid (CO2 is a weak acid in water). So F would be CO2 (weak acid), G would be NaOH (strong base). Doesn't fit because F is supposed to be a strong acid.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of a different approach.

Wait, maybe C is a compound that when it reacts with D, forms E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's say D is a halogen like Cl2. So C + 2 Cl2 → E. What would E be? If C is, say, SO2, then adding Cl2 might not do much. Alternatively, if C is H2S, adding Cl2 could form S and HCl, but that's probably not extremely hazardous.

Wait, maybe E is a cyanide compound. But how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly oxidizing substance, like O3 or Cl2O. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen. For example, C is FeO, and D is Cl2. Then FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3. But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a phosgene gas, but I don't see how that would form from C and D.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. When it reacts with D (what could D be?), if D is Cl2, then FeS + Cl2 → FeCl3 + S. That's a possibility. But would that be extremely hazardous? FeCl3 is toxic but not extremely so, I think.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. How would that form? If C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of C and D being a highly reactive compound. For example, if C is NH3 and D is HCl, but that forms NH4Cl, which isn't a gas.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry of E. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

I remember that these are symmetry groups from crystallography. C2 is a 2-fold rotation axis. D4h has a four-fold rotation axis with horizontal mirror planes. D∞h has an infinite fold rotation axis (like a cylinder) with horizontal mirrors. C2v has a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Which of these are common for certain molecules? For example, D4h is the symmetry of the square planar molecule, like XeF4. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with a center of inversion, like CO2 or HCN. C2 would have a molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis, like water (but water has C2v symmetry, not C2).

Wait, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if it's a molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis and some mirror planes, it could be C2v.

But what is E? Let's suppose that E is a linear molecule, like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

But wait, if E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve gas or something like that, but I'm not sure of their structures.

Alternatively, another possibility: if E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry, but O2 is not extremely hazardous, though. Or, if E is something like phosgene (which is O=C(Cl)2), which has a planar structure, and its symmetry group would be D∞h. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas, which fits the description of E being extremely hazardous.

Phosgene has the structure O=C(Cl)2, which is linear. Its point group is D∞h because it has a center of inversion and a C∞ axis with two mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, how would E form? Let me see.

If reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. Let's say C is something that, when reacted with D, produces phosgene.

Wait, but phosgene is produced from CO and Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst, like in the reaction CO + 2 Cl2 → CCl2O (which is phosgene). So D could be Cl2, and C would be CO.

Wait, but CO is a gas, but according to reaction 1, C is a solid. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, let me reevaluate. If C is CO (gas), but reaction 1 produces C as a bright red product. CO is a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe E is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone). Ozone has a bent structure, with a symmetry group of C2v. Ozone is a toxic gas, but not extremely hazardous. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O, which is dichlorine monoxide. Cl2O has a trigonal planar structure, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group. Alternatively, Cl2O has a bent structure, which would have a C2v symmetry.

Wait, but Cl2O is not a linear molecule. So perhaps its symmetry group is C2v.

Another possibility: if E is a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, such as H2O (which has C2v symmetry). But H2O is a liquid, not a gas, and not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like NH3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, like HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas, which fits the description.

So, if E is HCN, its symmetry group would be D∞h.

But then, how does HCN form from C and D? Let's think about reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is HCN, then D must be a source of CN. But D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Wait, but reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if C is KCN, then KCN + H2O → K(OH) + HCN. So F would be KOH (strong base, not acid) and G would be HCN (weak acid). Doesn't fit because F should be a strong acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting closer.

Wait, another possibility: if E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. It's a gas, and while not extremely hazardous, it can be harmful in high concentrations. But the question says extremely hazardous, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a more dangerous gas with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like CH3CN (acetonitrile), but that's a liquid and not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like CH2Cl2, but that's a liquid and not linear.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent)

Assuming E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, perhaps like phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) or HCN.

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN.

Assuming D is H2, then C would need to be CN^- and H+? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is CO. Then CO + 2 Cl2 → CCl2O (phosgene), which is a possible reaction. But earlier I thought that C would be a solid, but CO is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a solid in reaction 1, but a gas in reaction 2. That's possible. For example, C could be FeO (solid) which reacts with Cl2 (gas) to form FeCl3 (solid), but that doesn't fit the color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a solid like MnO2, which reacts with Cl2 to form MnCl4? Not sure about the color.

Another angle: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS is a solid, which reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3 and S. But I'm not sure about the reaction products.

Wait, perhaps E is a gas with D∞h symmetry, like HCN, which is a linear molecule. So if E is HCN, then D must be something that can combine with C to form HCN. Let's say D is H2 and C is CN. But CN is a liquid under standard conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and C is CNCl. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me make an assumption: the symmetry group of E is D∞h, so the answer is option C.

But wait, another possibility: if E is a molecule with a mirror plane and a 2-fold rotation axis, like H2O2, which has C2v symmetry. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a gas, and not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like O2, which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. O2 is a gas, and while it's not extremely hazardous, maybe in the context of the question it's considered so.

If E is O2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → O2. But I'm not sure what C and D would be. Maybe C is FeO and D is O2, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or HCN.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, and considering that D∞h is the symmetry of linear molecules with a center of inversion, I think E is a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene. So the symmetry group would be D∞h.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The high molar ratio suggests A and B are likely simple substances, and C is a compound with a specific color. The bright red color hints at a transition metal complex or a compound like HCN, which is red in some forms.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This suggests E is a highly toxic or reactive molecule. Examples include HCN or phosgene (O=C(Cl)₂), both of which are linear molecules with specific symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield acids. For example, if C is HCN, hydrolysis would produce HCN (weak acid) and a strong acid like HCl.

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests H is a simple solvent like water or methanol, formed from gases reacting in a 1:1 ratio.

5. **Symmetry Group of E**: The options for molecular symmetry groups are C₂, D₄h, D∞h, and C₂v. Linear molecules like HCN or phosgene have D∞h symmetry due to their infinite-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. These molecules are consistent with the description of E being extremely hazardous.

Given the analysis, E is likely a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene, which has D∞h symmetry. This matches the description of E as extremely hazardous and aligns with the symmetry group provided in the options.

**Answer: C**
