Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves creating a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I remember means the vector has two genes (bicistronic) under different promoters or regulatory elements. 

So, the vector has two ORFs: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, and the receptor has an IRES element upstream, which I remember allows internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed as a separate protein without read-through from the first.

The experiment involves creating a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They cross these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10's regulatory elements, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signals, which would come from eGFP. But they don't see any. The question is why.

The options are A to D. Let's think through each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I don't think this directly relates to the expression of the GFP in the construct. The question is about why the eGFP isn't showing up.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it would be trafficked to the cell surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be expressed on the surface, but the eGFP is a reporter. So would that affect detection? Western blot uses total proteins, but the confocal looks for fluorescence. If the eGFP isn't getting to the surface, they wouldn't see the green signal. However, the construct would still be expressed; the Western blot would detect it. The question says the Western blot was done after transfection, but it's not clear if the eGFP was detected then or not. Wait, the initial setup is that they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on Western blot. But in the mouse model, they're looking for GFP expression upon crossing with Cre.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is used for the ligand. If the enhancer is missing, the ligand might not be expressed. But the receptor is under the IRES, which usually doesn't require an enhancer because it's part of the same transcript as the first gene (ligand). Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so each gene has its own promoter? Or is it a single promoter for both? Wait, bicistronic vectors can have two different promoters or use an IRES. In this case, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under an IRES. IRES allows for separate translation without needing another promoter. So maybe the enhancer isn't the issue here.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF for the receptor isn't in frame with eGFP, then the protein would either not be expressed or produce a truncated, nonfunctional protein. But eGFP should be expressed as a separate fusion. Wait, no, the way it's described is that the receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is probably at the N-terminus and eGFP at the C-terminus. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP might not be correctly appended. So if the receptor is there but the eGFP isn't, perhaps the eGFP isn't showing up.

But wait, the way the vector is set up: The ligand is first, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the receptor followed by a lox2272 stop cassette and eGFP. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression of the downstream genes. But when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites. 

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So, the ligand is at 5', with a stop cassette. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. The receptor is at 3', with a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272.

When Cre is introduced, it would recombine loxP sites. The ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. Cre from the SOX10-Cre mice would recognize the loxP sites and delete the stop cassettes.

Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre can recognize loxP, but if the other is lox2272, which is a mutant version, then Cre can only cut loxP. So the ligand's stop would be removed (as Cre would delete loxP-stop-loxP), but the receptor's stop (lox2272) would remain because Cre can't cut lox2272. Or wait, no: lox2272 is a variant that can be cut by Cre but requires a longer recognition, maybe. I'm a bit confused, but I think that loxP is the standard site, and lox2272 is a variant that can only be cut in the presence of Cre when paired with another lox2272. Alternatively, some systems use different lox sites so that Cre can't excise both cassettes unless both are the same.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid has two different stop cassettes. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272. SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre, which would only cut loxP sites. So in this case, when Cre is expressed, it would delete the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing the ligand (and mCherry) to be expressed. However, the lox2272 cassette wouldn't be cut because Cre can't recognize lox2272. So the receptor's stop remains, meaning that the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed.

Wait, that can't be right because the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the IRES allows for internal initiation. So the first gene (ligand) is under CBA promoter, then when the transcript goes through, the IRES allows for translation of the second gene (receptor).

But the stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry and between receptor and eGFP. So, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (as the CBA promoter is active), but the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed via the IRES, but the eGFP would be prevented by the stop cassette.

But when Cre is present, it would delete the loxP cassette for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor, since it's flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut, the stop remains, so the eGFP would not be expressed.

Wait, that's not entirely correct. Because the IRES is upstream of the receptor, perhaps the receptor is under the same promoter as the ligand. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. The receptor might also be expressed, but without the eGFP. But when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, so both ligand and mCherry are expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the way the question describes the vector is a bicistronic vector with the ligand ORF at 5' and the receptor at 3', each followed by a stop cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a stop cassette, so ligand is expressed, mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette, so receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

When Cre is introduced (from the SOX10-Cre mice), the loxP sites (on the ligand side) are cut, allowing the stop cassette to be removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. But the lox2272 sites for the receptor and eGFP are not cut because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but that would mean the receptor is expressed but without eGFP fusion. So in the mouse, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't. Hence, when they look for eGFP fluorescence, they don't see anything.

But the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is active there). Therefore, in the offspring, Cre is active in neural crest cells, which would delete the loxP sites for the ligand but not the lox2272 for the receptor. So ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

Wait, but why would the receptor not be expressed? Because the stop cassette is in the way? No, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the receptor ORF is after the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed because the IRES allows its translation, but the eGFP isn't because of the stop cassette. But when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is cut, so mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection, but the problem is that in the mouse, they're looking for eGFP expression. So the question is why the eGFP isn't showing up.

Looking at the options, which one fits?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that were the case, the eGFP wouldn't be part of the same protein as the receptor. But wait, the way it's described, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ORF is receptor followed by eGFP, with a stop cassette in between. So if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated correctly. But wait, the stop cassette is between them, so if the stop is not removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless. But in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, so eGFP should be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't made.

But according to the vector setup, the Cre should cut the loxP and lox2272? Wait, no. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's by lox2272. Cre can cut loxP, but not lox2272. So after Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but why is the receptor's stop not being cut? Because it's flanked by lox2272, which Cre doesn't recognize. So even after Cre is active, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop cassette, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because Cre can't remove the stop cassette for the receptor. So in the offspring, the eGFP isn't produced, hence no green signal.

Looking at the options, which one fits this scenario?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But in this case, the problem isn't the frame; it's that the stop cassette isn't being removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue isn't the frame but the expression.

Wait, another angle: the IRES element. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein. But if the stop cassette isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed, so the receptor is expressed without eGFP. So in the Western blot, would the receptor be detected? But the question says that the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection, but I think that's in a different context. The mouse model is what's being examined for GFP expression.

So why no eGFP? Because the stop cassette is still present. So the problem is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being cut by Cre, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question is about the lack of green signal. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Because the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre, so the stop remains. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the mouse's cells are expressing the receptor (but without eGFP), but the eGFP isn't made.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? The options are about why the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't correctly expressed as a fusion. But in this case, the stop is preventing eGFP expression.

But wait, the stop is in between the receptor and eGFP. So even if the receptor is expressed, the eGFP isn't. So the problem is that the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But why would the stop cassette remain? Because the lox sites aren't compatible with Cre. So, the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre. So the stop remains.

Wait, but the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette isn't removed because the Cre isn't able to cut the lox2272 sites.

But the options don't mention anything about the lox sites or Cre. So perhaps the issue is something else.

Wait, perhaps the way the vector is set up is that both stop cassettes are loxP. Or maybe the vector has different configurations. Wait, the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's stop is lox2272. So only the ligand's stop is cut, not the receptor's. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the correct answer would be that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette is not removed. But none of the options directly state that. So maybe I should look for which option aligns with this reasoning.

Looking at option D again: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion. But the stop cassette's presence is the issue. So perhaps the actual problem is that the stop cassette is present, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, the way the vector is constructed: the ligand is under CBA, then a stop cassette (loxP), then the receptor is under IRES, then a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

In the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, no. If the IRES is upstream of the receptor, then the receptor is expressed regardless of the stop cassette. The stop cassette is after the receptor, between it and eGFP. So the stop cassette would prevent the eGFP from being expressed unless the stop is removed. So without Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. With Cre, the loxP is cut but the lox2272 isn't, so the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but wait. The IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed. So the stop after the receptor wouldn't affect its expression. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, would the receptor be detected? The question says that the initial Western blot (after transfection) was done using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, showing a signal proportional to actin loading. So that implies that the proteins are being expressed.

But in the mouse model, after Cre is introduced, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't? Or the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So the vector is in both alleles. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, which would induce recombination.

So in neural crest cells, the ligand and mCherry are expressed because the loxP stop is cut. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor is expressed without eGFP, but the eGFP isn't made.

So when they look for green fluorescence (eGFP), they don't see it because it's not expressed. So why?

Because the eGFP ORF is behind a stop cassette that isn't cut. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed.

But the options don't have that as a choice. So perhaps the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, but that would mean that the stop isn't the issue, but the frame. But according to the vector setup, the stop is the issue.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but the eGFP is not because the stop isn't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no signal.

But looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would imply that the eGFP isn't part of the same protein as the receptor, so it's not expressed. But in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor, so if the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem isn't the frame but the stop cassette.

But none of the options directly address the stop cassette. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my understanding of the vector setup.

Another approach: the vector is bicistronic with two cassettes. The ligand is first, then a stop. The receptor is after IRES, then a stop. Cre is supposed to remove both stops.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses two different lox sites to allow for independent control. So, when Cre is present, it would delete both stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But if it only deletes the loxP stop, then the eGFP stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed, which prevents eGFP expression.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated, but the stop would still be a problem.

Wait, perhaps the stop isn't the issue. Maybe the IRES isn't working. But the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

But I don't think any of the options directly talk about the lox sites. So perhaps another approach: the presence of a stop cassette in between the receptor and eGFP means that eGFP isn't expressed unless the stop is removed. If the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have this explanation. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't being cut. But why isn't it being cut?

Because the lox2272 sites can't be cut by Cre. So Cre can cut loxP but not lox2272. So even after Cre is introduced, the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't cut, but looking at the options, none directly state this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP after the receptor, but the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop is still present. But the options don't mention this, so I must look for the best fit.

Wait, looking back: the vector has the ligand under CBA, then a stop, then the receptor under IRES, then a stop and eGFP.

In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is cut, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is under lox2272, which isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because its stop isn't removed.

But the options don't directly say that. So perhaps option D is correct. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, their ORFs are not properly aligned, so eGFP isn't expressed. That would prevent the eGFP signal. But why would the stop cassette still be present? Because the frame is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because it's not in frame, so the stop isn't the issue. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: when the Cre is expressed, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop for the ligand and mCherry. But for the receptor and eGFP, the stop is still present, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the issue is the stop cassette. Since the options don't address this, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning correctly. But IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed without the ligand's promoter.

Wait, the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They cross with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So the ligand and mCherry should be expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't include this, so perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't in frame, so it isn't expressed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, but the question states that the IRES is present, which should allow the receptor to be expressed.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the issue is that the eGFP's stop isn't being cut because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre. So the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, another thought: The loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes are in different positions. The ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and the receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP. So the Cre would cut the ligand's stop but not the receptor's. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. The only option that talks about the eGFP not being expressed is D. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The vector contains two stop cassettes: the ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre mice were used to activate Cre in neural crest cells, which should remove the loxP stop cassette for the ligand but not the lox2272 stop cassette for the receptor. This setup allows the ligand and mCherry to be expressed but prevents the receptor and eGFP from being expressed.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: The ligand and receptor being in a paracrine relationship does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. This option is irrelevant to the experimental setup.
- **Option B**: If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would still be expressed but retained in the Golgi. This would not prevent detection of eGFP fluorescence, making this option unlikely.
- **Option C**: The CBA promoter is strong and sufficient for ligand expression. The IRES element allows receptor expression independently of the ligand promoter. There is no evidence that an enhancer is missing, making this option unlikely.
- **Option D**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion protein. However, the primary issue here is the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre cannot cut. This prevents eGFP expression, making this option the most plausible explanation.

The lack of eGFP expression is due to the lox2272 stop cassette remaining intact, as Cre cannot cut it. This prevents eGFP from being expressed, aligning most closely with **Option D**, which suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not properly expressed as a single construct.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves creating a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I remember means the vector has two genes (bicistronic) under different promoters or regulatory elements.

But the lox2272 sites for the receptor and eGFP are not cut because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but that would mean the receptor is expressed but without eGFP fusion. So in the mouse, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't. Hence, when they look for eGFP fluorescence, they don't see anything.

But the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is active there). Therefore, in the offspring, Cre is active in neural crest cells, which would delete the loxP sites for the ligand but not the lox2272 for the receptor. So ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

Wait, but why would the receptor not be expressed? Because the stop cassette is in the way? No, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the receptor ORF is after the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed because the IRES allows its translation, but the eGFP isn't because of the stop cassette. But when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is cut, so mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection, but the problem is that in the mouse, they're looking for eGFP expression. So the question is why the eGFP isn't showing up.

Looking at the options, which one fits?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that were the case, the eGFP wouldn't be part of the same protein as the receptor. But wait, the way it's described, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ORF is receptor followed by eGFP, with a stop cassette in between. So if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated correctly. But wait, the stop cassette is between them, so if the stop is not removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless. But in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, so eGFP should be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't made.

But according to the vector setup, the Cre should cut the loxP and lox2272? Wait, no. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's by lox2272. Cre can cut loxP, but not lox2272. So after Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but why is the receptor's stop not being cut? Because it's flanked by lox2272, which Cre doesn't recognize. So even after Cre is active, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop cassette, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because Cre can't remove the stop cassette for the receptor. So in the offspring, the eGFP isn't produced, hence no green signal.

Looking at the options, which one fits this scenario?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But in this case, the problem isn't the frame; it's that the stop cassette isn't being removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue isn't the frame but the expression.

Wait, another angle: the IRES element. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein. But if the stop cassette isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed, so the receptor is expressed without eGFP. So in the Western blot, would the receptor be detected? But the question says that the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection, but I think that's in a different context. The mouse model is what's being examined for GFP expression.

So why no eGFP? Because the stop cassette is still present. So the problem is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being cut by Cre, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question is about the lack of green signal. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Because the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre, so the stop remains. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the mouse's cells are expressing the receptor (but without eGFP), but the eGFP isn't made.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? The options are about why the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't correctly expressed as a fusion. But in this case, the stop is preventing eGFP expression.

But wait, the stop is in between the receptor and eGFP. So even if the receptor is expressed, the eGFP isn't. So the problem is that the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But why would the stop cassette remain? Because the lox sites aren't compatible with Cre. So, the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre. So the stop remains.

Wait, but the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette isn't removed because the Cre isn't able to cut the lox2272 sites.

But the options don't mention anything about the lox sites or Cre. So perhaps the issue is something else.

Wait, perhaps the way the vector is set up is that both stop cassettes are loxP. Or maybe the vector has different configurations. Wait, the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's stop is lox2272. So only the ligand's stop is cut, not the receptor's. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the correct answer would be that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette is not removed. But none of the options directly state that. So maybe I should look for which option aligns with this reasoning.

Looking at option D again: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion. But the stop cassette's presence is the issue. So perhaps the actual problem is that the stop cassette is present, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, the way the vector is constructed: the ligand is under CBA, then a stop cassette (loxP), then the receptor is under IRES, then a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

In the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, no. If the IRES is upstream of the receptor, then the receptor is expressed regardless of the stop cassette. The stop cassette is after the receptor, between it and eGFP. So the stop cassette would prevent the eGFP from being expressed unless the stop is removed. So without Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. With Cre, the loxP is cut but the lox2272 isn't, so the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but wait. The IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed. So the stop after the receptor wouldn't affect its expression. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, would the receptor be detected? The question says that the initial Western blot (after transfection) was done using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, showing a signal proportional to actin loading. So that implies that the proteins are being expressed.

But in the mouse model, after Cre is introduced, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't? Or the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So the vector is in both alleles. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, which would induce recombination.

So in neural crest cells, the ligand and mCherry are expressed because the loxP stop is cut. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor is expressed without eGFP, but the eGFP isn't made.

So when they look for green fluorescence (eGFP), they don't see it because it's not expressed. So why?

Because the eGFP ORF is behind a stop cassette that isn't cut. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed.

But the options don't have that as a choice. So perhaps the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, but that would mean that the stop isn't the issue, but the frame. But according to the vector setup, the stop is the issue.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but the eGFP is not because the stop isn't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no signal.

But looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would imply that the eGFP isn't part of the same protein as the receptor, so it's not expressed. But in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor, so if the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem isn't the frame but the stop cassette.

But none of the options directly address the stop cassette. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my understanding of the vector setup.

Another approach: the vector is bicistronic with two cassettes. The ligand is first, then a stop. The receptor is after IRES, then a stop. Cre is supposed to remove both stops.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses two different lox sites to allow for independent control. So, when Cre is present, it would delete both stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But if it only deletes the loxP stop, then the eGFP stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed, which prevents eGFP expression.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated, but the stop would still be a problem.

Wait, perhaps the stop isn't the issue. Maybe the IRES isn't working. But the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

But I don't think any of the options directly talk about the lox sites. So perhaps another approach: the presence of a stop cassette in between the receptor and eGFP means that eGFP isn't expressed unless the stop is removed. If the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have this explanation. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't being cut. But why isn't it being cut?

Because the lox2272 sites can't be cut by Cre. So Cre can cut loxP but not lox2272. So even after Cre is introduced, the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't cut, but looking at the options, none directly state this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP after the receptor, but the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop is still present. But the options don't mention this, so I must look for the best fit.

Wait, looking back: the vector has the ligand under CBA, then a stop, then the receptor under IRES, then a stop and eGFP.

In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is cut, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is under lox2272, which isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because its stop isn't removed.

But the options don't directly say that. So perhaps option D is correct. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, their ORFs are not properly aligned, so eGFP isn't expressed. That would prevent the eGFP signal. But why would the stop cassette still be present? Because the frame is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because it's not in frame, so the stop isn't the issue. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: when the Cre is expressed, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop for the ligand and mCherry. But for the receptor and eGFP, the stop is still present, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the issue is the stop cassette. Since the options don't address this, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning correctly. But IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed without the ligand's promoter.

Wait, the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They cross with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So the ligand and mCherry should be expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't include this, so perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't in frame, so it isn't expressed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, but the question states that the IRES is present, which should allow the receptor to be expressed.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the issue is that the eGFP's stop isn't being cut because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre. So the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, another thought: The loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes are in different positions. The ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and the receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP. So the Cre would cut the ligand's stop but not the receptor's. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. The only option that talks about the eGFP not being expressed is D. So perhaps that's the intended answer.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The vector contains two stop cassettes: the ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre mice were used to activate Cre in neural crest cells, which should remove the loxP stop cassette for the ligand but not the lox2272 stop cassette for the receptor. This setup allows the ligand and mCherry to be expressed but prevents the receptor and eGFP from being expressed.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: The ligand and receptor being in a paracrine relationship does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. This option is irrelevant to the experimental setup.
- **Option B**: If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would still be expressed but retained in the Golgi. This would not prevent detection of eGFP fluorescence, making this option unlikely.
- **Option C**: The CBA promoter is strong and sufficient for ligand expression. The IRES element allows receptor expression independently of the ligand promoter. There is no evidence that an enhancer is missing, making this option unlikely.
- **Option D**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion protein. However, the primary issue here is the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre cannot cut. This prevents eGFP expression, making this option the most plausible explanation.

The lack of eGFP expression is due to the lox2272 stop cassette remaining intact, as Cre cannot cut it. This prevents eGFP from being expressed, aligning most closely with **Option D**, which suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not properly expressed as a single construct.

Answer: D
