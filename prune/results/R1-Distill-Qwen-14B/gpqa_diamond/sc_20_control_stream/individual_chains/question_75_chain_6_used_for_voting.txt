Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mice. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that I'm creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed. I'm using a plasmid that's been transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. I added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. But when I check, the protein isn't being expressed as expected. So I'm looking for the reason why.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to see if there's an issue in the coding sequence that would prevent proper translation. The sequence given is the plus strand, which is the sense strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this, and the protein is synthesized based on the mRNA.

Let me think about the possible options:

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If the HA tag's DNA sequence is incorrect, that could lead to an incorrect protein. But the problem is that the construct isn't being expressed at all, not just the HA part. Plus, the question said the HA is introduced as a single determinant, but if it's a missense, maybe the protein is expressed but not recognized. Not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. If there's a UAA, UAG, or UGA codon somewhere, the ribosome would stop. So I need to look for those in the coding sequence.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't followed by a linker, maybe the protein is getting degraded. But the question is about expression, not detection. Also, proteolysis would happen post-translation, so I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem is that the protein isn't being expressed, not that it's being broken down after.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for UAA, that doesn't make sense because stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. tRNAs recognize start (AUG) and other codons. So having a UAA codon would terminate translation regardless of the tRNA presence because it's a stop signal.

Wait, but let me look at the DNA sequence. Let's find the reading frame and look for stop codons.

The HA tag is at the N-terminus. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Let me write out the codons:

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC... 

Wait, wait. Let me parse the DNA into codons, looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA, which would be stop codons.

Wait, the DNA is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this, except T becomes U. So each triplet in the DNA (plus strand) corresponds to mRNA codon in the same reading frame, except T becomes U.

Let me go through the sequence step by step.

The first 3 nucleotides: ATG. That's the start codon, methionine. So mRNA is AUG.

Next 3: TAC → mRNA is AUA? Wait, no. Wait, the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is the non-coding strand. So the DNA sequence is plus strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the DNA but with T→U. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the DNA is double-stranded: the coding (sense) strand is the same as mRNA, except T→U. So the plus strand has ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT... and so on. So the mRNA is the same as the plus DNA strand but with U instead of T.

So, the first codon is ATG → AUG (start).

Next codon: TAC → UAC (tyrosine).

Then CCA → CCA (proline).

TAC → UAC (tyrosine).

GAT → GAT (aspartic acid).

GGT → GGT (glycine).

TCC → Serine.

AGA → Arginine.

TTA → Leu.

CGC → CGA (R), but wait, DNA is CGC, so mRNA is CGA, which is arginine.

Wait, no. DNA is plus strand: CGC → mRNA is CGA (since it's the same strand, mRNA is complementary to the template strand, which would be GCG). Wait, wait. No, I'm messing this up.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the template (antisense) strand. So the sense (plus) strand is the same as mRNA except T→U. So the plus strand DNA is the same as mRNA.

Wait, let me think again. For DNA strands: the coding (sense) strand is same as mRNA (except T→U). The template (antisense) strand is complementary to mRNA.

So when I look at the plus strand DNA, that's the same as the mRNA, except Ts become Us.

So the first codon is ATG → AUG (start).

Next three: TAC → UAC (tyrosine).

Then CCA → CCA (proline).

TAC → UAC (tyr).

GAT → GAT (aspartic acid).

GGT → GGT (glycine).

TCC → AGA (because the DNA is TCC on plus strand; wait, no. Wait, DNA is plus strand: TCC. So the mRNA is same as plus strand, so TCC becomes UCC? Or wait, no. Wait, DNA is plus strand, so mRNA is same as plus strand, with T→U.

Wait, no, the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, so the plus strand is same as mRNA. So the DNA's plus strand's sequence is same as mRNA, with T replaced by U.

So, DNA: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC (etc.)

mRNA: AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GGT UCC.

So the mRNA codons are AUG (start), UAC (tyr), CCA (pro), UAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GGT (gly), UCC (ser), etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me write the DNA in triplets, then convert to mRNA.

DNA: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC ...

So each triplet:

1. ATG → AUG
2. TAC → UAC
3. CCA → CCA
4. TAC → UAC
5. GAT → GAT
6. GGT → GGT
7. TCC → UCC
8. AGA → AGA
9. TTA → UUA
10. CGC → CGA
11. CAA → CAA
12. ATG → AUG
13. ACT → ACT
14. CTG → CTG
15. GAA → GAA
16. GAA → GAA
17. TCC → UCC
18. ... etc.

Wait, looking for any stop codons in the mRNA. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking through each codon:

1. AUG (start)
2. UAC (tyr)
3. CCA (pro)
4. UAC (tyr)
5. GAT (aspartic acid)
6. GGT (gly)
7. UCC (ser)
8. AGA (arg)
9. UUA (leu)
10. CGA (arg)
11. CAA (glu)
12. AUG (met)
13. ACT (thr)
14. CTG (leu)
15. GAA (glu)
16. GAA (glu)
17. UCC (ser)
... etc.

Wait, any of these UAA, UAG, UGA?

I don't see any in the first 17. Let me keep going.

Continuing the DNA:

After CTG GAA GAA TCC, next triplets:

GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC...

So mRNA:

GCG → GCG (unlikely, as it's mRNA, so GCG is ala)
GCC → GCC (ala)
AGG → AGG (arg)
ACA → ACA (thr)
CAG → CAG (gln)
TTT → Phe
CC → CGG? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me line it up properly.

Wait, perhaps the DNA sequence is longer, so let me see if any of the triplets in the mRNA are UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking through:

Looking for UAA: any triplet with UAA in mRNA. So in the DNA, that would be ATT on the plus strand (since DNA is complementary to mRNA).

But looking through the DNA sequence, I don't see any ATT, but let me check.

Wait, let me go through the DNA:

Looking for any triplet in the plus strand that is TAA, TAG, or TGA. Because the mRNA would be UAA, UAG, UGA respectively if the DNA has TAA, TAG, TGA.

So in the plus DNA strand:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the DNA:

Looking at the sequence:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me scan for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA.

Looking through every three letters:

Hmm, scanning for TAA:

Looking for 'TAA' in the DNA. Let's see: 

Looking for T followed by A followed by A.

Looking through the sequence: 

...ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC...

Wait, I see a 'TTA' in there (positions 18-20: TTA). That's DNA triplet TTA → mRNA UUA (leucine). Not a stop codon.

Wait, later on I see 'CTGA'— no, maybe 'TGA' somewhere.

Looking again: 

...ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC...

No TGA there.

Wait, looking further: 

...CGAGTGA3'

Wait, the end of the sequence is GAGTGA. So the last part is GAG TGA.

Wait, the last six nucleotides are GAGTGA. So the triplet is TGA, which is in the DNA.

DNA has TGA at the end? Let me see: the last part is ...GCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last three are TGA in the DNA. So the DNA has TGA as the last triplet before the end.

So the mRNA would have UGA as the last codon.

If the construct ends with UGA, that's a stop codon. So the mRNA would terminate translation there. So the GADD45G coding sequence in the construct ends with UGA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all if the stop is in frame.

Wait, but why is the gene construct ending with a stop codon? Normally, you would add a stop codon after the gene, but if the gene itself ends with a stop codon, that could be a problem.

Wait, but GADD45G is a gene that has its own stop codon. So if the construct includes the entire coding sequence plus the HA tag, perhaps the original gene's stop codon is included, leading the ribosome to stop early.

So the problem is that the construct includes the gene's own stop codon, which is in the middle of the HA-tagged protein. So the ribosome would terminate translation at that point, leading to a truncated protein or no expression if the HA is before the stop.

Wait, but in this case, the HA is at the N-terminus. So if there's a stop codon in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence, the protein would be truncated, leading to lower expression or no full-length protein.

Wait, but looking back, the sequence provided starts with ATG (start) and ends with TGA. So the mRNA would end with UGA, which is a stop codon.

So the coding sequence includes a stop codon at the end. But that's normal for a gene—each gene has a stop codon at the end. So why is that a problem?

Wait, perhaps the construct was designed incorrectly. Maybe the HA tag is in frame, but the stop codon is at the end of the HA sequence, which is before the GADD45G coding sequence. Or perhaps the HA is added in the same reading frame, but the original GADD45G gene's stop codon is included, leading to premature termination.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon. But the HA is a short peptide (like YPYDVPDYD) and doesn't include a stop codon. So the construct would have the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence, and then the end of the GADD45G would have a stop codon.

Wait, but the DNA sequence provided is the entire coding sequence, including the HA tag and the GADD45G. So the construct includes a stop codon at the end, which would cause the ribosome to stop there.

But why would that prevent overexpression? Because the full-length protein isn't made. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus, the stop codon would be after the HA and the GADD45G coding sequence. So the ribosome would translate the entire HA and GADD45G, then stop. That should produce the full-length protein. Unless the stop codon is in the middle of the HA or GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by the ATG start codon for GADD45G, and the GADD45G has its own stop codon after. So the construct would have the HA, then GADD45G starts with ATG. But if the GADD45G's stop codon is present, the ribosome would stop there, making the HA plus part of GADD45G, but not the full protein.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the first ATG is the start of the HA-tagged protein. Let me see: the DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC ...

So, the first ATG is the start, then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), TAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GGT (glycine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (CGA in mRNA, arginine), CAA (glutamic acid), ATG (start codon again). Wait, hold on. The next ATG is in the middle. That would be a problem.

Because in the mRNA, the first codon is AUG (start), then UAC, CCA, and so on, until we reach ATG again. So the mRNA would have another AUG in the middle, which would be a start codon. So the ribosome would start translating from there, leading to a frameshift or a completely wrong protein from that point onward.

Wait, let me parse the mRNA:

The mRNA starts with AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GGT UCC AGA UUA CGA CAA AUG ACT CTG GAA GAA UCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GCA ... etc.

So the first AUG is the start, then after several codons, another AUG appears. That's a problem because the ribosome could start a new translation at that point, leading to a shorter protein or a frameshift.

Wait, but the ribosome usually doesn't start translating in the middle of a reading frame unless there's a uORF (upstream open reading frame) or another initiation codon. So if the mRNA has another AUG in frame, the ribosome might re-initiate translation at that point, leading to a truncated protein.

So looking back at the DNA sequence, the second ATG is in the middle. So the mRNA would have a second AUG, which would be another start codon. That would cause the ribosome to start translating from that point, leading to a shorter protein because the original start is followed by some codons, then another start. So the full-length protein isn't made, leading to no overexpression.

So the problem is that the construct has another start codon (AUG) in the middle of the coding sequence. This would cause the ribosome to terminate early or produce a truncated protein.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if there's a stop codon, but in this case, it's a start codon in the middle. Hmm, wait. Alternatively, perhaps there's a stop codon after that.

Wait, the DNA after the second ATG is ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC... So the mRNA would be:

ACT → Thr

CTG → Leu

GAA → Glu

GAA → Glu

TCC → Ser

GCG → Ala

GCC → Ala

AGG → Arg

ACA → Thr

CAG → Gln

TTT → Phe

CC → CGG (since DNA is CC, mRNA is GG, but wait, no. The DNA is CC, so mRNA is GG? No, wait, DNA is plus strand, so mRNA is same as DNA except T→U. So DNA triplet is TCC → mRNA is UCC.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me rephrase.

The mRNA after the second AUG would be: ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), TCC (Ser), GCG (Ala), GCC (Ala), AGG (Arg), ACA (Thr), CAG (Gln), TTT (Phe), etc.

But since the ribosome started at the second AUG, the reading frame would be different. The initial part before that (from the first AUG) is translated into a short peptide, then the ribosome restarts, leading to a different reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the ribosome doesn't restart and continues in the same frame, but the presence of another AUG could lead to a frameshift.

Wait, but the presence of another AUG in the same frame might not cause a frameshift but could lead to a new start. So the ribosome would translate the first part (from the first AUG to the second AUG as a codon) and then start a new peptide from the second AUG, leading to a truncated protein.

In this case, the actual HA tag and the beginning of GADD45G would be translated, but then the ribosome starts anew, leading to a shorter protein. Hence, the full-length HA-GADD45G isn't expressed, which explains the lack of overexpression.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would happen if there's a stop codon. But in this case, the issue is an extra start codon, causing a premature termination or a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the second AUG leads to a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in the same frame but the actual GADD45G coding sequence is not correctly followed by a stop codon, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is added as a fusion, so the entire coding sequence after the HA should be in frame. If the HA is in frame, the entire sequence, including the GADD45G, should be correctly translated. But if the HA is followed by another ATG (start codon), that would disrupt the reading frame.

Wait, the HA tag is added as a single determinant at the N-terminus. So the HA would be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA is in frame, the ATG of the GADD45G should be in frame. But in the DNA sequence, the second ATG is not in frame with the first. Let's see:

The first ATG is position 1-3.

The next ATG is at position 20-22? Let me count.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG...

So the first ATG is positions 1-3. The next ATG is positions 20-22 (assuming each triplet is three letters):

Wait, let me count:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TAC

7-9: CCA

10-12: TAC

13-15: GAT

16-18: GGT

19-21: TCC

22-24: AGA

25-27: TTA

28-30: CGC

31-33: CAA

34-36: ATG

So the second ATG is at positions 34-36. The first ATG is at 1-3.

So between the first and second ATG, the number of nucleotides is 33 (34-1=33). 33 nucleotides is 11 codons, so the second ATG is in the same reading frame as the first. So the ribosome would read through and include the second ATG as part of the coding sequence.

But that would lead to a second methionine in the protein. But that's not a problem per se; it's just another methionine. However, perhaps the issue is that the second ATG introduces an early stop codon downstream.

Wait, but looking at the mRNA, after the second ATG (position 34-36 in DNA, which is mRNA 34-36 as AUG), what comes next?

The next codon is ACT (Thr), then CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), TCC (Ser), GCG (Ala), GCC (Ala), AGG (Arg), ACA (Thr), CAG (Gln), TTT (Phe), etc.

Wait, but looking for any stop codons in this part. The mRNA after the second AUG is:

ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, TCC, GCG, GCC, AGG, ACA, CAG, TTT, CC, GGA, AAA, GCA, ..., and so on.

No UAA, UAG, or UGA in this stretch. So the only stop codon is at the very end, which is UGA (from TGA in DNA). So the full-length protein should be translated until the end, with the stop codon at the end.

Wait, but the problem is that the user couldn't overexpress the protein. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is followed by another start codon, but that doesn't necessarily cause a problem if the rest is in frame.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again. The problem is that the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But in the DNA sequence, the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, but if the HA isn't correctly in frame, or if the start codon is in the wrong place, that could cause a frameshift.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so I need to make sure that the ATG for the HA is correctly in frame. Wait, no—the HA is added as a tag, so the construct should be HA followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, with the ATG for GADD45G in frame with the HA.

But looking at the DNA sequence, the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, which starts with ATG. So the HA's coding sequence ends, and the GADD45G starts with ATG, which is the start codon.

Wait, but the HA is a separate coding sequence. No, the HA is part of the same coding sequence. Because the HA is a short peptide, it's just added at the N-terminus of the GADD45G.

So the plasmid's coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G, both in the same reading frame.

But looking at the DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC, CCA, TAC, etc., and then another ATG in the middle.

Wait, wait. The first ATG is the start of the HA-GADD45G fusion. The HA would be a few amino acids, then the GADD45G starts. But the GADD45G's own start codon is in the middle of the construct.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the HA is a separate sequence, the construct's coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G, but if the GADD45G's own ATG is in the middle, that would create another start codon in the same reading frame, leading to a frameshift or a new initiation.

Wait, but the GADD45G's ATG is in the middle of the HA-GADD45G construct, which is not correct. The GADD45G should be in frame after the HA, but its own ATG would introduce another start codon, leading the ribosome to initiate translation from there, causing a frameshift or truncation.

So the presence of another ATG in the same frame after the initial start would lead to the ribosome starting a new translation, leading to a shorter protein.

So the problem is that the construct includes the GADD45G's own ATG, which is in the middle of the HA-GADD45G coding sequence. This causes the ribosome to start translating again, leading to a frameshift or a truncated protein.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon after the second ATG, but I don't see a stop codon in the mRNA after the second ATG. The only stop codon is at the very end.

Alternatively, the presence of the second ATG may cause the ribosome to read beyond, but since it's in frame, perhaps the full-length protein is made, but with an extra Met in the middle. That shouldn't prevent expression, but maybe the expression is lower because the ribosome has to read through it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is followed by another ATG, which is not part of the HA but the GADD45G's start. So the HA is in frame, and the GADD45G starts with ATG. But the HA is added as a tag, so the construct should not include the ATG of GADD45G again, because that would add another Met in the middle.

Wait, no. The HA is added at the N-terminus, so the HA's coding sequence is followed by the GADD45G's coding sequence, which starts with ATG. So the HA's coding sequence ends, then the GADD45G starts, which has its own ATG. So the overall construct is HA followed by GADD45G, both in frame.

But that would mean that the mRNA would have the HA's codons, then the GADD45G's codons starting with ATG. So the mRNA would be something like: HA's codons, then AUG (ATG) for GADD45G's start.

Wait, but the HA is a short peptide, so its coding sequence is before the ATG of GADD45G. So the overall mRNA would start with HA's sequence, then the GADD45G's sequence starts with ATG.

Wait, that's correct. So the HA is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. But in the provided DNA sequence, the second ATG is in the middle of the HA-GADD45G construct. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the HA is not followed by the correct sequence, leading to a frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is followed by the GADD45G's coding sequence correctly, but the presence of another ATG doesn't cause a problem because it's in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. Unlikely, because the problem is lack of expression, not incorrect HA.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. This would happen if a stop codon is present. But in the message, the only stop is at the end. Unless another stop is introduced.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. Unlikely because proteolysis occurs after translation; the issue here is lack of expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon, which doesn't require a tRNA. So D is incorrect.

So the only possibility is that the construct includes a stop codon early. But looking at the mRNA, the only stop is at the end. Unless the presence of the second ATG causes a frameshift that introduces a stop.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the second ATG disrupts the reading frame, leading to a frameshift mutation, which could introduce a stop codon downstream.

Wait, if the ribosome starts translating from the second ATG, it's in the same frame. So the initial part is translated, then the ribosome restarts at the second ATG, leading to a different reading frame.

Wait, no. If the second ATG is in the same frame, the ribosome would start there, but the frame remains the same. So the initial part is translated, then another Met is added, but the frame continues. So the entire GADD45G would be translated, just with an extra Met in the middle. That shouldn't prevent expression, but perhaps the presence of multiple Met codons is causing some issue, or perhaps the construct is being recognized as multiple ORFs, leading to instability or other issues.

Alternatively, the presence of another ATG in the same frame could lead to a uORF (upstream open reading frame), which could reduce the translation of the main ORF. But if the uORF is in the 5' UTR, that's more common. Here, the uORF is in the coding region, which is less likely to affect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the construct contains a stop codon in the middle, but looking back, the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the construct doesn't have a polyA signal or proper termination. But the problem says the sequence is the coding sequence, so polyA isn't part of the coding.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the initial problem statement. The user introduced a HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. The DNA sequence provided starts with ATG, which is correct for the HA start.

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon. Let me think: the HA tag is YPYDVPDYD, which is about 11 amino acids. So the DNA sequence for HA would be about 33 nucleotides. Let me see if the initial part of the DNA includes a TGA or other stop codon.

Looking at the first 33 nucleotides:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, perhaps the HA is added correctly, but the GADD45G's own start codon is present, leading to the construct having an extra ATG in the middle. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G, but GADD45G starts with ATG again, causing another start codon in the middle.

Thus, the mRNA would have the HA sequence, then AUG (start) for GADD45G. The ribosome would read through the HA, then upon encountering the second AUG, it might start a new translation, leading to a truncated protein.

But why would that prevent overexpression? Because the full-length protein isn't made; perhaps the construct is more prone to errors, or the truncated proteins are less stable, leading to lower detection.

Alternatively, the presence of two start codons in the same frame could lead to a frameshift if the ribosome doesn't read through. But if the second ATG is in frame, it may not cause a frameshift but just an extra Met.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is followed by the GADD45G's start codon, which introduces a premature stop codon downstream. But in the DNA, the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, perhaps there's a stop codon in the middle due to a frameshift caused by the second ATG. Let me see.

If the ribosome starts at the first ATG, it translates the HA, then encounters the second ATG in the middle. If it doesn't restart, it continues in the same frame and reaches the end, with the stop codon at the end. But if it does restart, it would read from the second ATG, leading to a different frame, possibly introducing a stop codon earlier.

Wait, in the mRNA, if the ribosome starts at the second AUG, the reading frame shifts, and the following codons would be read differently. Let's see:

After the second AUG, the next codons would be ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, TCC, etc.

But in a new reading frame, perhaps a stop codon appears earlier. Let me see:

After the second AUG (position 34-36 in DNA), the mRNA would be:

Position 34: A (from ATG), then position 35: U (from C), position 36: G (from A) → AUG (start).

1588-1590: G (from G), T (from T), T (Alright, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to break it down. So the setup is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They modified the gene to include a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine. But when they checked, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the plus strand's sequence and found something wrong.

The question is asking why the overexpression didn't happen. The options are A to D. Let me think through each step.

First, the construct. They added an HA tag at the N-terminus. HA is a common tag used for detecting proteins, often added via a linker. In the sequence provided, the first part should be the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the very beginning is 5' ATG..., which is the start codon (methionine). So the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct for the start of a protein. Then after that, looking for the HA tag. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Its amino acid sequence is YPYDHHQTYL. Wait, but the DNA sequence is for the coding (sense) strand. So the cDNA for HA would be the coding sequence for that amino acid string.

Wait, but the HA tag is added as a sequence before the GADD45G coding region. So right after the start codon, there should be the HA tag sequence. Let me see. The first part of the sequence is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG AAA GCA CAG CCA... Hmm. Wait, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), then CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), etc.

Wait, but the HA tag's nucleotide sequence would be based on the amino acid sequence. The HA tag is YPYDHHQTYL. So let's think about that. The amino acid sequence is Y (tyrosine), P (proline), Y (tyrosine), D (aspartic acid), H (histidine), H (histidine), Q (glutamine), T (threonine), Y (tyrosine), L (leucine). So each of these is a codon.

Let me write out the nucleotide sequence for the HA tag. Starting with Y (TAC), P (CCC), Y (TAC), D (GAT), H (CAT), H (CAT), Q (CAA), T (TCA), Y (TAC), L (CTG). So putting that all together, the coding sequence would be TAC CCC TAC GAT CAT CAT CAA TCA TAC CTG.

Wait, let me check each:

Y → TAC,
P → CCC,
Y → TAC,
D → GAT,
H → CAT,
H → CAT,
Q → CAA,
T → TCA,
Y → TAC,
L → CTG.

So the HA tag DNA sequence should be TAC CCC TAC GAT C AT CAT CAA TCA TAC CTG. Wait, maybe I missed a period. So the HA tag would be this sequence: TAC CCC TAC GAT CAT CAT CAA TCA TAC CTG.

Looking back at the plus strand provided, the start is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, right after the ATG start codon, the next codon is TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), etc.

But the HA tag should be TAC followed by CCC, then TAC again, then GAT, CAT, etc. So the third codon is ATA (Ile), which doesn't match the HA tag's second amino acid, which should be Proling after Y. So the HA tag sequence is not present here.

Wait, but the construct was modified to add the HA tag. So the question is, where is the HA? It seems like the HA wasn't added correctly because the sequence doesn't match. Let me see: the first codon after ATG is TAC (Y), which is correct for the first Y in HA. The next is CCC (P), which is correct for the second P in HA. Then the third codon is ATA (Ile), which is wrong because the third amino acid in HA is Y. So the HA tag sequence is not present. That suggests that the HA wasn't correctly inserted. But why?

Wait, maybe the HA wasn't added at all, but if the construct is supposed to have the HA tag, why isn't it there? Well, looking at the sequence, I don't see the HA tag. So perhaps they forgot to include the HA tag in the construct, which would mean the protein doesn't have the tag and thus can't be purified, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is present but mutated.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

So the HA tag's DNA sequence would encode the correct amino acids. If there's a missense mutation, maybe the HA tag's DNA was altered, leading to incorrect amino acids. But looking at the sequence, the first two codons are correct (TAC, CCC), but the third is ATA (Ile) instead of TAC (Y). So that's a mutation. So in the construct, the HA tag is either missing or has a mutation. If the HA tag is missing, the protein can't be purified with an antibody against HA, which would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed. But wait, the question says that the problem is in the construct, leading to no overexpression. Alternatively, the HA tag is not present, but the question is why the researcher can't overexpress the protein.

Wait, but the options are about why the overexpression didn't occur. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not correctly inserted, which may cause the protein to not be expressed properly, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct causes a premature stop codon. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG and continues... looking through for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's scan the sequence.

Looking at the sequence:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets, reading in groups of three.

...ACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking through, I can see 'TGA' at position: Let's see:

Looking for TGA. Let's see, ...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see 'TGA' in 'TGAACG'. Let me break it down.

Looking at the part: ...GTC TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG... So here, 'TGA' is at position ... TCT TGA ACG ... So that's a TGA codon, which is a stop codon. So the DNA has a TGA somewhere in the coding sequence. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So wait, the DNA is in the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So any TGA in the plus strand DNA would be UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. So the GADD45G might not be expressed properly because the stop codon is present.

But why is there a TGA in the construct? Because the construct is supposed to code for GADD45G with an HA tag. So perhaps during the construction, an error was introduced, adding a TGA somewhere, which introduces a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if a stop codon was present in the coding sequence, leading to a truncated protein, which might not function and might not be detected, leading to no overexpression.

But wait, another possibility: the sequence might have a frameshift or a mutation elsewhere. Alternatively, the HA tag's addition might have caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. But in this case, the HA tag's coding sequence is present but incorrect, leading to a frameshift. Alternatively, the HA tag is not correctly added, so the ribosome is translating the GADD45G, but the HA tag isn't present, leading to no affinity purification. But the problem is that the researcher can't overexpress the protein.

Wait, but the problem is that the transfection didn't overexpress the protein. So why no overexpression? Let's think about the options.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. But UAA is a stop codon, and all organisms have mechanisms to terminate translation at stop codons. So this is unlikely because the presence of a stop codon would terminate, but the issue would be that the mRNA has a stop codon, so the protein would be truncated.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis. So if the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, maybe the protease is cutting it. But the HA tag is a short sequence; maybe the lack of a linker leads to the protein being recognized for degradation. But I'm not sure if that's the reason for no overexpression. The construct would have the HA tag, but if the proteases are cleaving it, maybe the protein isn't detected, but the cells are producing it. So the Western blot might not show it.

Option A: The HA tag has a missense mutation. So the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation, leading to incorrect amino acids. So the HA antibody wouldn't recognize it, making purification impossible. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed, which could be a result of something else. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon, which would lead to no protein being made.

Wait, in the DNA sequence provided, I noticed that there's a TGA in the coding sequence. That would translate to UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation early, producing a truncated protein. So the GADD45G isn't expressed correctly, which could explain the lack of overexpression.

So why is there a TGA? It could have been introduced during the cloning process. For example, if the HA tag wasn't inserted correctly, or if there was a mutation during PCR or cloning that introduced a TGA.

Looking back at the options, option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early." So this would be the case if a stop codon was present in the coding sequence, which would cause the ribosome to stop before the end of the GADD45G sequence, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein, which the researcher wouldn't detect as overexpressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag wasn't added correctly, leading to a frameshift. Let's say the HA tag's DNA was inserted incorrectly, causing a frameshift that leads to a stop codon downstream. But in the given sequence, the HA tag's coding sequence doesn't appear. Wait, but the first two codons after ATG are TAC and CCC, which would be Y and P, which are the first two amino acids of the HA tag. So the HA tag was perhaps only partially inserted, leading to a frameshift. Let's see: the HA tag's DNA is about 30 nucleotides (10 codons). But the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG... So after the initial ATG, we have TAC (Y), CCC (P), then ATA (I), CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), etc.

Wait, the HA tag should be 10 amino acids, but the sequence here only has two correct before something goes wrong. So after the second codon (CCC, P), the third codon is ATA (Ile), which is not TAC (Y). So that's a mutation. So the HA tag insertion is incorrect, leading to a frameshift. Let me count: HA tag should be 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. If the HA was inserted with a deletion or insertion, that would shift the reading frame.

But looking at the initial part of the DNA:

Original HA tag should be:

TAC (Y) CCC (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) CAT (H) CAT (H) CAA (Q) TCA (S) TAC (Y) CTG (L).

But in the construct, it's:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

So the first three codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATA (I). The HA tag should have the third codon as TAC (Y), but here it's ATA (I). That's a point mutation in the third codon. So the HA tag has a missense mutation in the third amino acid. So the HA tag is YPY in the construct, but it should be YPY. Wait, no, the third codon is changed, so the third amino acid becomes Ile instead of Tyr. So the HA tag is YPY... but in the construct, it's YPI... which is a mutation. So that's a missense mutation in the HA tag. So the HA tag is altered, leading to incorrect epitopes. So the antibody against HA wouldn't recognize it, making purification difficult. But then the researcher would have trouble purifying the protein, but the overexpression might still happen.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the HA tag's mutation caused a problem beyond just recognition. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduced a stop codon.

Wait, but looking further, after the initial part, the rest of the sequence seems to code for GADD45G. So the initial HA tag is messed up, but the rest is correct. So the GADD45G gene is intact. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduced a stop codon. Let me see: the HA tag is 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. The given DNA sequence only shows the first 30 nucleotides as:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, that's 28 nucleotides, which is about 9 codons. Hmm, perhaps the HA was only partially inserted, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA tag was inserted without the correct reading frame, the rest of the GADD45G would be in a different frame, leading to a stop codon somewhere downstream.

Wait, the plus strand's sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. Then the next codons are TAC (Y), CCC (P), then the third codon is ATA (I). The HA tag's third codon should be TAC (Y), so here it's mutated to ATA. So the third codon is incorrect. So the HA tag is Y P I ... instead of Y P Y D... So that's a missense mutation in the HA tag.

But the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So if the HA tag is present but incorrect, perhaps the protein is expressed but can't be detected by the HA antibody. But the question is why the researcher can't overexpress the protein. If the construct is correct, the gene should be expressed, but perhaps the HA tag's mutation is causing a problem beyond just detection.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduced a stop codon. Wait, the third codon is Ile (ATA), which is fine, but if it's followed by CGA (R), which is the fourth codon. If the HA tag is inserted correctly, the next codon should be TAC (Y) for the third amino acid. But in the construct, it's ATA (I) followed by CGA (R). So perhaps the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift. Let's see: normally, the HA tag would add 30 nucleotides (10 codons). If, for example, an extra nucleotide was inserted, that would shift the reading frame. But in this case, the HA tag seems to be only partially present, so perhaps the reading frame is incorrect.

But looking at the entire plus strand sequence, the initial part is the start codon, then the HA tag (partially), and then the rest of the GADD45G. Let's check whether the entire rest of the sequence is in frame. Let me count the number of nucleotides from the start to see if it's a multiple of three.

The entire plus strand sequence is 1023 nucleotides long (counted by looking at the sequence—each line is about 60-70 nucleotides, and adding them up: let's see, 10 lines would be about 600, but I'm not exact, but the key is whether the length is a multiple of three. Wait, the sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. Let me count the total length.

The sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Counting the letters:

Each line is 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60... Wait, that's too tedious. Alternatively, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the entire ORF should end at that point. But the given sequence ends with TGA, so that's a stop. So the coding sequence ends early due to the TGA. So the GADD45G gene's coding sequence is truncated because of this stop codon.

So the presence of a TGA in the middle of the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early, leading to no full-length protein. So the researcher can't overexpress the protein because it's not being made properly; the mRNA has a premature stop codon, so the protein is not synthesized.

So why is there a TGA? It must be an artifact introduced during the cloning process. Let's say that when inserting the HA tag, a mutation occurred, introducing a TGA codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift leading to a stop codon.

Looking back at the options, option B is the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if the mRNA has a stop codon.

Alternatively, option A is a missense mutation in the HA tag. But that would affect the HA epitope but not necessarily the expression of the full-length protein. The researcher might not detect it via Western blot but would still express the protein. So the lack of overexpression is more likely due to a premature stop codon.

So the correct answer is either A or B. But the presence of TGA suggests that the mRNA has a stop codon, causing early termination.

Wait, the HA tag insertion is messed up, and that leads to a frameshift, causing a stop codon downstream. So the presence of TGA in the sequence is likely the result of a frameshift caused by incorrect insertion of the HA tag.

Another thought: the HA tag was inserted correctly but without a linker, which could cause proteolysis (option C). But if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, proteolysis would cleave off the tag, but the rest of the protein would still be expressed. So the researcher wouldn't see the full-length protein but might see a truncated version. But the question is about overexpression not happening, which suggests the protein isn't made at all.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's incorrect insertion (a missense) doesn't cause a stop codon, but the construct's overall expression is low. But the problem is that the construct's sequence includes a stop codon, so the ribosome stops early, leading to no full-length protein.

So the correct answer must be B: the ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence starts with the correct start codon (ATG) but contains a premature stop codon (TGA) downstream. This stop codon is likely introduced due to an error during the construction of the plasmid, such as a frameshift or a mutation during cloning. The presence of TGA in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein. This explains the lack of full-length GADD45G protein and, consequently, the failure to overexpress the protein.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.  
  While the HA tag sequence appears to have a mutation (e.g., the third codon is altered), this would primarily affect the recognition by HA-specific antibodies and not necessarily prevent protein expression. The issue here is the premature stop codon, not just the HA tag mutation.

- **Option B**: The ribosome terminated the translation early.  
  This is consistent with the presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated protein that is not functional or detectable as overexpressed.

- **Option C**: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.  
  While the absence of a linker could theoretically lead to proteolysis, the primary issue here is the premature stop codon, which prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized in the first place.

- **Option D**: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.  
  This is irrelevant because the premature stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA, and all organisms have mechanisms to recognize stop codons.

The most likely explanation for the lack of overexpression is the premature stop codon introduced into the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. 

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mice. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that I'm creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed. I'm using a plasmid that's been transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. I added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. But when I check, the protein isn't being expressed as expected. So I'm looking for the reason why.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to see if there's an issue in the coding sequence that would prevent proper translation. The sequence given is the plus strand, which is the sense strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this, and the protein is synthesized based on the mRNA.

Let me think about the possible options:

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If the HA tag's DNA sequence is incorrect, that could lead to an incorrect protein. But the problem is that the construct isn't being expressed at all, not just the HA part. Plus, the question said the HA is introduced as a single determinant, but if it's a missense, maybe the protein is expressed but not recognized. Not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. If there's a UAA, UAG, or UGA codon somewhere, the ribosome would stop. So I need to look for those in the coding sequence.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't followed by a linker, maybe the protein is getting degraded. But the question is about expression, not detection. Also, proteolysis would happen post-translation, so I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem is that the protein isn't being expressed, not that it's being broken down after.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for UAA, that doesn't make sense because stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. tRNAs recognize start (AUG) and other codons. So having a UAA codon would terminate translation regardless of the tRNA presence because it's a stop signal.

Wait, but let me look at the DNA sequence. Let's find the reading frame and look for stop codons.

The HA tag is at the N-terminus. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Let me write out the codons:

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC... 

Wait, wait. Let me parse the DNA into codons, looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA, which would be stop codons.

Wait, the DNA is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this, except T becomes U. So each triplet in the DNA (plus strand) corresponds to mRNA codon in the same reading frame, except T becomes U.

Let me go through the sequence step by step.

The first 3 nucleotides: ATG. That's the start codon, methionine. So mRNA is AUG.

Next 3: TAC → mRNA is AUA? Wait, no. Wait, the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is the non-coding strand. So the DNA sequence is plus strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the DNA but with T→U. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the DNA is double-stranded: the coding (sense) strand is the same as mRNA, except T→U. So the plus strand has ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT... and so on. So the mRNA is the same as the plus DNA strand but with U instead of T.

So, the first codon is ATG → AUG (start).

Next codon: TAC → UAC (tyrosine).

Then CCA → CCA (proline).

TAC → UAC (tyrosine).

GAT → GAT (aspartic acid).

GGT → GGT (glycine).

TCC → Serine.

AGA → Arginine.

TTA → Leu.

CGC → CGA (R), but wait, DNA is CGC, so mRNA is CGA, which is arginine.

Wait, no. DNA is plus strand: CGC → mRNA is CGA (since it's the same strand, mRNA is complementary to the template strand, which would be GCG). Wait, wait. No, I'm messing this up.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the template (antisense) strand. So the sense (plus) strand is the same as mRNA except T→U. So the plus strand DNA is the same as mRNA.

Wait, let me think again. For DNA strands: the coding (sense) strand is same as mRNA (except T→U). The template (antisense) strand is complementary to mRNA.

So when I look at the plus strand DNA, that's the same as the mRNA, except Ts become Us.

So the first codon is ATG → AUG (start).

Next three: TAC → UAC (tyrosine).

Then CCA → CCA (proline).

TAC → UAC (tyr).

GAT → GAT (aspartic acid).

GGT → GGT (glycine).

TCC → AGA (because the DNA is TCC on plus strand; wait, no. Wait, DNA is plus strand: TCC. So the mRNA is same as plus strand, so TCC becomes UCC? Or wait, no. Wait, DNA is plus strand, so mRNA is same as plus strand, with T→U.

Wait, no, the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, so the plus strand is same as mRNA. So the DNA's plus strand's sequence is same as mRNA, with T replaced by U.

So, DNA: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC (etc.)

mRNA: AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GGT UCC.

So the mRNA codons are AUG (start), UAC (tyr), CCA (pro), UAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GGT (gly), UCC (ser), etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me write the DNA in triplets, then convert to mRNA.

DNA: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC ...

So each triplet:

1. ATG → AUG
2. TAC → UAC
3. CCA → CCA
4. TAC → UAC
5. GAT → GAT
6. GGT → GGT
7. TCC → UCC
8. AGA → AGA
9. TTA → UUA
10. CGC → CGA
11. CAA → CAA
12. ATG → AUG
13. ACT → ACT
14. CTG → CTG
15. GAA → GAA
16. GAA → GAA
17. TCC → UCC
18. ... etc.

Wait, looking for any stop codons in the mRNA. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking through each codon:

1. AUG (start)
2. UAC (tyr)
3. CCA (pro)
4. UAC (tyr)
5. GAT (aspartic acid)
6. GGT (gly)
7. UCC (ser)
8. AGA (arg)
9. UUA (leu)
10. CGA (arg)
11. CAA (glu)
12. AUG (met)
13. ACT (thr)
14. CTG (leu)
15. GAA (glu)
16. GAA (glu)
17. UCC (ser)
... etc.

Wait, any of these UAA, UAG, UGA?

I don't see any in the first 17. Let me keep going.

Continuing the DNA:

After CTG GAA GAA TCC, next triplets:

GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC...

So mRNA:

GCG → GCG (unlikely, as it's mRNA, so GCG is ala)
GCC → GCC (ala)
AGG → AGG (arg)
ACA → ACA (thr)
CAG → CAG (gln)
TTT → Phe
CC → CGG? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me line it up properly.

Wait, perhaps the DNA sequence is longer, so let me see if any of the triplets in the mRNA are UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking through:

Looking for UAA: any triplet with UAA in mRNA. So in the DNA, that would be ATT on the plus strand (since DNA is complementary to mRNA).

But looking through the DNA sequence, I don't see any ATT, but let me check.

Wait, let me go through the DNA:

Looking for any triplet in the plus strand that is TAA, TAG, or TGA. Because the mRNA would be UAA, UAG, UGA respectively if the DNA has TAA, TAG, TGA.

So in the plus DNA strand:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the DNA:

Looking at the sequence:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me scan for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA.

Looking through every three letters:

Hmm, scanning for TAA:

Looking for 'TAA' in the DNA. Let's see: 

Looking for T followed by A followed by A.

Looking through the sequence: 

...ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC...

Wait, I see a 'TTA' in there (positions 18-20: TTA). That's DNA triplet TTA → mRNA UUA (leucine). Not a stop codon.

Wait, later on I see 'CTGA'— no, maybe 'TGA' somewhere.

Looking again: 

...ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC...

No TGA there.

Wait, looking further: 

...CGAGTGA3'

Wait, the end of the sequence is GAGTGA. So the last part is GAG TGA.

Wait, the last six nucleotides are GAGTGA. So the triplet is TGA, which is in the DNA.

DNA has TGA at the end? Let me see: the last part is ...GCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last three are TGA in the DNA. So the DNA has TGA as the last triplet before the end.

So the mRNA would have UGA as the last codon.

If the construct ends with UGA, that's a stop codon. So the mRNA would terminate translation there. So the GADD45G coding sequence in the construct ends with UGA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all if the stop is in frame.

Wait, but why is the gene construct ending with a stop codon? Normally, you would add a stop codon after the gene, but if the gene itself ends with a stop codon, that could be a problem.

Wait, but GADD45G is a gene that has its own stop codon. So if the construct includes the entire coding sequence plus the HA tag, perhaps the original gene's stop codon is included, leading the ribosome to stop early.

So the problem is that the construct includes the gene's own stop codon, which is in the middle of the HA-tagged protein. So the ribosome would terminate translation at that point, leading to a truncated protein or no expression if the HA is before the stop.

Wait, but in this case, the HA is at the N-terminus. So if there's a stop codon in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence, the protein would be truncated, leading to lower expression or no full-length protein.

Wait, but looking back, the sequence provided starts with ATG (start) and ends with TGA. So the mRNA would end with UGA, which is a stop codon.

So the coding sequence includes a stop codon at the end. But that's normal for a gene—each gene has a stop codon at the end. So why is that a problem?

Wait, perhaps the construct was designed incorrectly. Maybe the HA tag is in frame, but the stop codon is at the end of the HA sequence, which is before the GADD45G coding sequence. Or perhaps the HA is added in the same reading frame, but the original GADD45G gene's stop codon is included, leading to premature termination.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon. But the HA is a short peptide (like YPYDVPDYD) and doesn't include a stop codon. So the construct would have the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence, and then the end of the GADD45G would have a stop codon.

Wait, but the DNA sequence provided is the entire coding sequence, including the HA tag and the GADD45G. So the construct includes a stop codon at the end, which would cause the ribosome to stop there.

But why would that prevent overexpression? Because the full-length protein isn't made. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus, the stop codon would be after the HA and the GADD45G coding sequence. So the ribosome would translate the entire HA and GADD45G, then stop. That should produce the full-length protein. Unless the stop codon is in the middle of the HA or GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by the ATG start codon for GADD45G, and the GADD45G has its own stop codon after. So the construct would have the HA, then GADD45G starts with ATG. But if the GADD45G's stop codon is present, the ribosome would stop there, making the HA plus part of GADD45G, but not the full protein.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the first ATG is the start of the HA-tagged protein. Let me see: the DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC ...

So, the first ATG is the start, then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), TAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GGT (glycine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (CGA in mRNA, arginine), CAA (glutamic acid), ATG (start codon again). Wait, hold on. The next ATG is in the middle. That would be a problem.

Because in the mRNA, the first codon is AUG (start), then UAC, CCA, and so on, until we reach ATG again. So the mRNA would have another AUG in the middle, which would be a start codon. So the ribosome would start translating from there, leading to a frameshift or a completely wrong protein from that point onward.

Wait, let me parse the mRNA:

The mRNA starts with AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GGT UCC AGA UUA CGA CAA AUG ACT CTG GAA GAA UCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GCA ... etc.

So the first AUG is the start, then after several codons, another AUG appears. That's a problem because the ribosome could start a new translation at that point, leading to a shorter protein or a frameshift.

Wait, but the ribosome usually doesn't start translating in the middle of a reading frame unless there's a uORF (upstream open reading frame) or another initiation codon. So if the mRNA has another AUG in frame, the ribosome might re-initiate translation at that point, leading to a truncated protein.

So looking back at the DNA sequence, the second ATG is in the middle. So the mRNA would have a second AUG, which would be another start codon. That would cause the ribosome to start translating from that point, leading to a shorter protein because the original start is followed by some codons, then another start. So the full-length protein isn't made, leading to no overexpression.

So the problem is that the construct has another start codon (AUG) in the middle of the coding sequence. This would cause the ribosome to terminate early or produce a truncated protein.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if there's a stop codon, but in this case, it's a start codon in the middle. Hmm, wait. Alternatively, perhaps there's a stop codon after that.

Wait, the DNA after the second ATG is ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAA GC... So the mRNA would be:

ACT → Thr

CTG → Leu

GAA → Glu

GAA → Glu

TCC → Ser

GCG → Ala

GCC → Ala

AGG → Arg

ACA → Thr

CAG → Gln

TTT → Phe

CC → CGG (since DNA is CC, mRNA is GG, but wait, no. The DNA is CC, so mRNA is GG? No, wait, DNA is plus strand, so mRNA is same as DNA except T→U. So DNA triplet is TCC → mRNA is UCC.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me rephrase.

The mRNA after the second AUG would be: ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), TCC (Ser), GCG (Ala), GCC (Ala), AGG (Arg), ACA (Thr), CAG (Gln), TTT (Phe), etc.

But since the ribosome started at the second AUG, the reading frame would be different. The initial part before that (from the first AUG) is translated into a short peptide, then the ribosome restarts, leading to a different reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the ribosome doesn't restart and continues in the same frame, but the presence of another AUG could lead to a frameshift.

Wait, but the presence of another AUG in the same frame might not cause a frameshift but could lead to a new start. So the ribosome would translate the first part (from the first AUG to the second AUG as a codon) and then start a new peptide from the second AUG, leading to a truncated protein.

In this case, the actual HA tag and the beginning of GADD45G would be translated, but then the ribosome starts anew, leading to a shorter protein. Hence, the full-length HA-GADD45G isn't expressed, which explains the lack of overexpression.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would happen if there's a stop codon. But in this case, the issue is an extra start codon, causing a premature termination or a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the second AUG leads to a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in the same frame but the actual GADD45G coding sequence is not correctly followed by a stop codon, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is added as a fusion, so the entire coding sequence after the HA should be in frame. If the HA is in frame, the entire sequence, including the GADD45G, should be correctly translated. But if the HA is followed by another ATG (start codon), that would disrupt the reading frame.

Wait, the HA tag is added as a single determinant at the N-terminus. So the HA would be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA is in frame, the ATG of the GADD45G should be in frame. But in the DNA sequence, the second ATG is not in frame with the first. Let's see:

The first ATG is position 1-3.

The next ATG is at position 20-22? Let me count.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG...

So the first ATG is positions 1-3. The next ATG is positions 20-22 (assuming each triplet is three letters):

Wait, let me count:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TAC

7-9: CCA

10-12: TAC

13-15: GAT

16-18: GGT

19-21: TCC

22-24: AGA

25-27: TTA

28-30: CGC

31-33: CAA

34-36: ATG

So the second ATG is at positions 34-36. The first ATG is at 1-3.

So between the first and second ATG, the number of nucleotides is 33 (34-1=33). 33 nucleotides is 11 codons, so the second ATG is in the same reading frame as the first. So the ribosome would read through and include the second ATG as part of the coding sequence.

But that would lead to a second methionine in the protein. But that's not a problem per se; it's just another methionine. However, perhaps the issue is that the second ATG introduces an early stop codon downstream.

Wait, but looking at the mRNA, after the second ATG (position 34-36 in DNA, which is mRNA 34-36 as AUG), what comes next?

The next codon is ACT (Thr), then CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), TCC (Ser), GCG (Ala), GCC (Ala), AGG (Arg), ACA (Thr), CAG (Gln), TTT (Phe), etc.

Wait, but looking for any stop codons in this part. The mRNA after the second AUG is:

ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, TCC, GCG, GCC, AGG, ACA, CAG, TTT, CC, GGA, AAA, GCA, ..., and so on.

No UAA, UAG, or UGA in this stretch. So the only stop codon is at the very end, which is UGA (from TGA in DNA). So the full-length protein should be translated until the end, with the stop codon at the end.

Wait, but the problem is that the user couldn't overexpress the protein. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is followed by another start codon, but that doesn't necessarily cause a problem if the rest is in frame.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again. The problem is that the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But in the DNA sequence, the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, but if the HA isn't correctly in frame, or if the start codon is in the wrong place, that could cause a frameshift.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so I need to make sure that the ATG for the HA is correctly in frame. Wait, no—the HA is added as a tag, so the construct should be HA followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, with the ATG for GADD45G in frame with the HA.

But looking at the DNA sequence, the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, which starts with ATG. So the HA's coding sequence ends, and the GADD45G starts with ATG, which is the start codon.

Wait, but the HA is a separate coding sequence. No, the HA is part of the same coding sequence. Because the HA is a short peptide, it's just added at the N-terminus of the GADD45G.

So the plasmid's coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G, both in the same reading frame.

But looking at the DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC, CCA, TAC, etc., and then another ATG in the middle.

Wait, wait. The first ATG is the start of the HA-GADD45G fusion. The HA would be a few amino acids, then the GADD45G starts. But the GADD45G's own start codon is in the middle of the construct.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the HA is a separate sequence, the construct's coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G, but if the GADD45G's own ATG is in the middle, that would create another start codon in the same reading frame, leading to a frameshift or a new initiation.

Wait, but the GADD45G's ATG is in the middle of the HA-GADD45G construct, which is not correct. The GADD45G should be in frame after the HA, but its own ATG would introduce another start codon, leading the ribosome to initiate translation from there, causing a frameshift or truncation.

So the presence of another ATG in the same frame after the initial start would lead to the ribosome starting a new translation, leading to a shorter protein.

So the problem is that the construct includes the GADD45G's own ATG, which is in the middle of the HA-GADD45G coding sequence. This causes the ribosome to start translating again, leading to a frameshift or a truncated protein.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon after the second ATG, but I don't see a stop codon in the mRNA after the second ATG. The only stop codon is at the very end.

Alternatively, the presence of the second ATG may cause the ribosome to read beyond, but since it's in frame, perhaps the full-length protein is made, but with an extra Met in the middle. That shouldn't prevent expression, but maybe the expression is lower because the ribosome has to read through it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is followed by another ATG, which is not part of the HA but the GADD45G's start. So the HA is in frame, and the GADD45G starts with ATG. But the HA is added as a tag, so the construct should not include the ATG of GADD45G again, because that would add another Met in the middle.

Wait, no. The HA is added at the N-terminus, so the HA's coding sequence is followed by the GADD45G's coding sequence, which starts with ATG. So the HA's coding sequence ends, then the GADD45G starts, which has its own ATG. So the overall construct is HA followed by GADD45G, both in frame.

But that would mean that the mRNA would have the HA's codons, then the GADD45G's codons starting with ATG. So the mRNA would be something like: HA's codons, then AUG (ATG) for GADD45G's start.

Wait, but the HA is a short peptide, so its coding sequence is before the ATG of GADD45G. So the overall mRNA would start with HA's sequence, then the GADD45G's sequence starts with ATG.

Wait, that's correct. So the HA is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. But in the provided DNA sequence, the second ATG is in the middle of the HA-GADD45G construct. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the HA is not followed by the correct sequence, leading to a frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is followed by the GADD45G's coding sequence correctly, but the presence of another ATG doesn't cause a problem because it's in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. Unlikely, because the problem is lack of expression, not incorrect HA.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. This would happen if a stop codon is present. But in the message, the only stop is at the end. Unless another stop is introduced.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. Unlikely because proteolysis occurs after translation; the issue here is lack of expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon, which doesn't require a tRNA. So D is incorrect.

So the only possibility is that the construct includes a stop codon early. But looking at the mRNA, the only stop is at the end. Unless the presence of the second ATG causes a frameshift that introduces a stop.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the second ATG disrupts the reading frame, leading to a frameshift mutation, which could introduce a stop codon downstream.

Wait, if the ribosome starts translating from the second ATG, it's in the same frame. So the initial part is translated, then the ribosome restarts at the second ATG, leading to a different reading frame.

Wait, no. If the second ATG is in the same frame, the ribosome would start there, but the frame remains the same. So the initial part is translated, then another Met is added, but the frame continues. So the entire GADD45G would be translated, just with an extra Met in the middle. That shouldn't prevent expression, but perhaps the presence of multiple Met codons is causing some issue, or perhaps the construct is being recognized as multiple ORFs, leading to instability or other issues.

Alternatively, the presence of another ATG in the same frame could lead to a uORF (upstream open reading frame), which could reduce the translation of the main ORF. But if the uORF is in the 5' UTR, that's more common. Here, the uORF is in the coding region, which is less likely to affect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the construct contains a stop codon in the middle, but looking back, the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the construct doesn't have a polyA signal or proper termination. But the problem says the sequence is the coding sequence, so polyA isn't part of the coding.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the initial problem statement. The user introduced a HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. The DNA sequence provided starts with ATG, which is correct for the HA start.

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon. Let me think: the HA tag is YPYDVPDYD, which is about 11 amino acids. So the DNA sequence for HA would be about 33 nucleotides. Let me see if the initial part of the DNA includes a TGA or other stop codon.

Looking at the first 33 nucleotides:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, perhaps the HA is added correctly, but the GADD45G's own start codon is present, leading to the construct having an extra ATG in the middle. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G, but GADD45G starts with ATG again, causing another start codon in the middle.

Thus, the mRNA would have the HA sequence, then AUG (start) for GADD45G. The ribosome would read through the HA, then upon encountering the second AUG, it might start a new translation, leading to a truncated protein.

But why would that prevent overexpression? Because the full-length protein isn't made; perhaps the construct is more prone to errors, or the truncated proteins are less stable, leading to lower detection.

Alternatively, the presence of two start codons in the same frame could lead to a frameshift if the ribosome doesn't read through. But if the second ATG is in frame, it may not cause a frameshift but just an extra Met.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is followed by the GADD45G's start codon, which introduces a premature stop codon downstream. But in the DNA, the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, perhaps there's a stop codon in the middle due to a frameshift caused by the second ATG. Let me see.

If the ribosome starts at the first ATG, it translates the HA, then encounters the second ATG in the middle. If it doesn't restart, it continues in the same frame and reaches the end, with the stop codon at the end. But if it does restart, it would read from the second ATG, leading to a different frame, possibly introducing a stop codon earlier.

Wait, in the mRNA, if the ribosome starts at the second AUG, the reading frame shifts, and the following codons would be read differently. Let's see:

After the second AUG, the next codons would be ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, TCC, etc.

But in a new reading frame, perhaps a stop codon appears earlier. Let me see:

After the second AUG (position 34-36 in DNA), the mRNA would be:

Position 34: A (from ATG), then position 35: U (from C), position 36: G (from A) → AUG (start).

Then position 37-39: C (from C), T (from A), A (from C) → CTA (Leu).

73-75: A (from A), G (from G), A (from A) → AGA (Arg).

76-78: G (from G), G (from G), C (from C) → GGC (gly).

79-81: C (from C), T (from T), A (from A) → CTA (Leu).

82-84: C (from C), C (from C), T (from T) → CCT (Pro).

85-87: T (from T), G (from G), G (from G) → TGG (Trp).

88-90: C (from C), A (from A), G (from G) → CAG (Gln).

91-93: G (from G), T (from T), T (from T) → GTT (Val).

94-96: C (from C), G (from G), A (from A) → CGA (Arg).

97-99: A (from A), G (from G), G (from G) → AGG (Arg).

100-102: C (from C), T (from T), C (from C) → CTG (Leu).

103-105: A (from A), A (from A), G (from G) → AAG (Lys).

106-108: G (from G), C (from C), C (from C) → GCC (Ala).

109-111: A (from A), G (from G), G (from G) → AGG (Arg).

112-114: G (from G), C (from C), T (from T) → GCT (Ala).

115-117: C (from C), A (from A), G (from G) → CAG (Gln).

118-120: G (from G), T (from T), T (from T) → GTT (Val).

121-123: C (from C), G (from G), C (from C) → CGC (Arg).

124-126: A (from A), G (from G), G (from G) → AGG (Arg).

127-129: C (from C), T (from T), G (from G) → CTG (Leu).

130-132: C (from C), A (from A), G (from G) → CAG (Gln).

133-135: G (from G), C (from C), T (from T) → GCT (Ala).

136-138: T (from T), G (from G), C (from C) → TGC (Cys).

139-141: A (from A), A (from A), G (from G) → AAG (Lys).

142-144: C (from C), G (from G), C (from C) → CGC (Arg).

1588-1590: G (from G), T (from T), T (Alright, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to break it down. So the setup is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They modified the gene to include a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine. But when they checked, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the plus strand's sequence and found something wrong.

The question is asking why the overexpression didn't happen. The options are A to D. Let me think through each step.

First, the construct. They added an HA tag at the N-terminus. HA is a common tag used for detecting proteins, often added via a linker. In the sequence provided, the first part should be the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the very beginning is 5' ATG..., which is the start codon (methionine). So the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct for the start of a protein. Then after that, looking for the HA tag. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Its amino acid sequence is YPYDHHQTYL. Wait, but the DNA sequence is for the coding (sense) strand. So the cDNA for HA would be the coding sequence for that amino acid string.

Wait, but the HA tag is added as a sequence before the GADD45G coding region. So right after the start codon, there should be the HA tag sequence. Let me see. The first part of the sequence is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG AAA GCA CAG CCA... Hmm. Wait, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), then CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), etc.

Wait, but the HA tag's nucleotide sequence would be based on the amino acid sequence. The HA tag is YPYDHHQTYL. So let's think about that. The amino acid sequence is Y (tyrosine), P (proline), Y (tyrosine), D (aspartic acid), H (histidine), H (histidine), Q (glutamine), T (threonine), Y (tyrosine), L (leucine). So each of these is a codon.

Let me write out the nucleotide sequence for the HA tag. Starting with Y (TAC), P (CCC), Y (TAC), D (GAT), H (CAT), H (CAT), Q (CAA), T (TCA), Y (TAC), L (CTG). So putting that all together, the coding sequence would be TAC CCC TAC GAT CAT CAT CAA TCA TAC CTG.

Wait, let me check each:

Y → TAC,
P → CCC,
Y → TAC,
D → GAT,
H → CAT,
H → CAT,
Q → CAA,
T → TCA,
Y → TAC,
L → CTG.

So the HA tag DNA sequence should be TAC CCC TAC GAT C AT CAT CAA TCA TAC CTG. Wait, maybe I missed a period. So the HA tag would be this sequence: TAC CCC TAC GAT CAT CAT CAA TCA TAC CTG.

Looking back at the plus strand provided, the start is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, right after the ATG start codon, the next codon is TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), etc.

But the HA tag should be TAC followed by CCC, then TAC again, then GAT, CAT, etc. So the third codon is ATA (Ile), which doesn't match the HA tag's second amino acid, which should be Proling after Y. So the HA tag sequence is not present here.

Wait, but the construct was modified to add the HA tag. So the question is, where is the HA? It seems like the HA wasn't added correctly because the sequence doesn't match. Let me see: the first codon after ATG is TAC (Y), which is correct for the first Y in HA. The next is CCC (P), which is correct for the second P in HA. Then the third codon is ATA (Ile), which is wrong because the third amino acid in HA is Y. So the HA tag sequence is not present. That suggests that the HA wasn't correctly inserted. But why?

Wait, maybe the HA wasn't added at all, but if the construct is supposed to have the HA tag, why isn't it there? Well, looking at the sequence, I don't see the HA tag. So perhaps they forgot to include the HA tag in the construct, which would mean the protein doesn't have the tag and thus can't be purified, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is present but mutated.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

So the HA tag's DNA sequence would encode the correct amino acids. If there's a missense mutation, maybe the HA tag's DNA was altered, leading to incorrect amino acids. But looking at the sequence, the first two codons are correct (TAC, CCC), but the third is ATA (Ile) instead of TAC (Y). So that's a mutation. So in the construct, the HA tag is either missing or has a mutation. If the HA tag is missing, the protein can't be purified with an antibody against HA, which would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed. But wait, the question says that the problem is in the construct, leading to no overexpression. Alternatively, the HA tag is not present, but the question is why the researcher can't overexpress the protein.

Wait, but the options are about why the overexpression didn't occur. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not correctly inserted, which may cause the protein to not be expressed properly, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct causes a premature stop codon. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG and continues... looking through for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's scan the sequence.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets, reading in groups of three.

Looking through, I can see 'TGA' at position: Let's see:

Looking for TGA. Let's see, ...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see 'TGA' in 'TGAACG'. Let me break it down.

Looking at the part: ...GTC TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG... So here, 'TGA' is at position ... TCT TGA ACG ... So that's a TGA codon, which is a stop codon. So the DNA has a TGA somewhere in the coding sequence. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So wait, the DNA is in the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So any TGA in the plus strand DNA would be UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. So the GADD45G might not be expressed properly because the stop codon is present.

But why is there a TGA in the construct? Because the construct is supposed to code for GADD45G with an HA tag. So perhaps during the construction, an error was introduced, adding a TGA somewhere, which introduces a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if a stop codon was present in the coding sequence, leading to a truncated protein, which might not function and might not be detected, leading to no overexpression.

But wait, another possibility: the sequence might have a frameshift or a mutation elsewhere. Alternatively, the HA tag's addition might have caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. But in this case, the HA tag's coding sequence is present but incorrect, leading to a frameshift. Alternatively, the HA tag is not correctly added, so the ribosome is translating the GADD45G, but the HA tag isn't present, leading to no affinity purification. But the problem is that the researcher can't overexpress the protein.

Wait, but the problem is that the transfection didn't overexpress the protein. So why no overexpression? Let's think about the options.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. But UAA is a stop codon, and all organisms have mechanisms to terminate translation at stop codons. So this is unlikely because the presence of a stop codon would terminate, but the issue would be that the mRNA has a stop codon, so the protein would be truncated.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis. So if the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, maybe the protease is cutting it. But the HA tag is a short sequence; maybe the lack of a linker leads to the protein being recognized for degradation. But I'm not sure if that's the reason for no overexpression. The construct would have the HA tag, but if the proteases are cleaving it, maybe the protein isn't detected, but the cells are producing it. So the Western blot might not show it.

Option A: The HA tag has a missense mutation. So the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation, leading to incorrect amino acids. So the HA antibody wouldn't recognize it, making purification impossible. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed, which could be a result of something else. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon, which would lead to no protein being made.

Wait, in the DNA sequence provided, I noticed that there's a TGA in the coding sequence. That would translate to UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation early, producing a truncated protein. So the GADD45G isn't expressed correctly, which could explain the lack of overexpression.

So why is there a TGA? It could have been introduced during the cloning process. For example, if the HA tag wasn't inserted correctly, or if there was a mutation during PCR or cloning that introduced a TGA.

Looking back at the options, option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early." So this would be the case if a stop codon was present in the coding sequence, which would cause the ribosome to stop before the end of the GADD45G sequence, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein, which the researcher wouldn't detect as overexpressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag wasn't added correctly, leading to a frameshift. Let's say the HA tag's DNA was inserted incorrectly, causing a frameshift that leads to a stop codon downstream. But in the given sequence, the HA tag's coding sequence doesn't appear. Wait, but the first two codons after ATG are TAC and CCC, which would be Y and P, which are the first two amino acids of the HA tag. So the HA tag was perhaps only partially inserted, leading to a frameshift. Let's see: the HA tag's DNA is about 30 nucleotides (10 codons). But the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG... So after the initial ATG, we have TAC (Y), CCC (P), then ATA (I), CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), etc.

Wait, the HA tag should be 10 amino acids, but the sequence here only has two correct before something goes wrong. So after the second codon (CCC, P), the third codon is ATA (Ile), which is not TAC (Y). So that's a mutation. So the HA tag insertion is incorrect, leading to a frameshift. Let me count: HA tag should be 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. If the HA was inserted with a deletion or insertion, that would shift the reading frame.

But looking at the initial part of the DNA:

Original HA tag should be:

TAC (Y) CCC (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) CAT (H) CAT (H) CAA (Q) TCA (S) TAC (Y) CTG (L).

But in the construct, it's:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

So the first three codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATA (I). The HA tag should have the third codon as TAC (Y), but here it's ATA (I). That's a point mutation in the third codon. So the HA tag has a missense mutation in the third amino acid. So the HA tag is YPY in the construct, but it should be YPY. Wait, no, the third codon is changed, so the third amino acid becomes Ile instead of Tyr. So the HA tag is YPY... but in the construct, it's YPI... which is a mutation. So that's a missense mutation in the HA tag. So the HA tag is altered, leading to incorrect epitopes. So the antibody against HA wouldn't recognize it, making purification difficult. But then the researcher would have trouble purifying the protein, but the overexpression might still happen.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the HA tag's mutation caused a problem beyond just recognition. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduced a stop codon.

Wait, but looking further, after the initial part, the rest of the sequence seems to code for GADD45G. So the initial HA tag is messed up, but the rest is correct. So the GADD45G gene is intact. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduced a stop codon. Let me see: the HA tag is 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. The given DNA sequence only shows the first 30 nucleotides as:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, that's 28 nucleotides, which is about 9 codons. Hmm, perhaps the HA was only partially inserted, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA tag was inserted without the correct reading frame, the rest of the GADD45G would be in a different frame, leading to a stop codon somewhere downstream.

Wait, the plus strand's sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. Then the next codons are TAC (Y), CCC (P), then the third codon is ATA (I). The HA tag's third codon should be TAC (Y), so here it's mutated to ATA. So the third codon is incorrect. So the HA tag is Y P I ... instead of Y P Y D... So that's a missense mutation in the HA tag.

But the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So if the HA tag is present but incorrect, perhaps the protein is expressed but can't be detected by the HA antibody. But the question is why the researcher can't overexpress the protein. If the construct is correct, the gene should be expressed, but perhaps the HA tag's mutation is causing a problem beyond just detection.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduced a stop codon. Wait, the third codon is Ile (ATA), which is fine, but if it's followed by CGA (R), which is the fourth codon. If the HA tag is inserted correctly, the next codon should be TAC (Y) for the third amino acid. But in the construct, it's ATA (I) followed by CGA (R). So perhaps the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift. Let's see: normally, the HA tag would add 30 nucleotides (10 codons). If, for example, an extra nucleotide was inserted, that would shift the reading frame. But in this case, the HA tag seems to be only partially present, so perhaps the reading frame is incorrect.

But looking at the entire plus strand sequence, the initial part is the start codon, then the HA tag (partially), and then the rest of the GADD45G. Let's check whether the entire rest of the sequence is in frame. Let me count the number of nucleotides from the start to see if it's a multiple of three.

The entire plus strand sequence is 1023 nucleotides long (counted by looking at the sequence—each line is about 60-70 nucleotides, and adding them up: let's see, 10 lines would be about 600, but I'm not exact, but the key is whether the length is a multiple of three. Wait, the sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. Let me count the total length.

The sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Counting the letters:

Each line is 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60... Wait, that's too tedious. Alternatively, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the entire ORF should end at that point. But the given sequence ends with TGA, so that's a stop. So the coding sequence ends early due to the TGA. So the GADD45G gene's coding sequence is truncated because of this stop codon.

So the presence of a TGA in the middle of the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early, leading to no full-length protein. So the researcher can't overexpress the protein because it's not being made properly; the mRNA has a premature stop codon, so the protein is not synthesized.

So why is there a TGA? It must be an artifact introduced during the cloning process. Let's say that when inserting the HA tag, a mutation occurred, introducing a TGA codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift leading to a stop codon.

Looking back at the options, option B is the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if the mRNA has a stop codon.

Alternatively, option A is a missense mutation in the HA tag. But that would affect the HA epitope but not necessarily the expression of the full-length protein. The researcher might not detect it via Western blot but would still express the protein. So the lack of overexpression is more likely due to a premature stop codon.

So the correct answer is either A or B. But the presence of TGA suggests that the mRNA has a stop codon, causing early termination.

Wait, the HA tag insertion is messed up, and that leads to a frameshift, causing a stop codon downstream. So the presence of TGA in the sequence is likely the result of a frameshift caused by incorrect insertion of the HA tag.

Another thought: the HA tag was inserted correctly but without a linker, which could cause proteolysis (option C). But if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, proteolysis would cleave off the tag, but the rest of the protein would still be expressed. So the researcher wouldn't see the full-length protein but might see a truncated version. But the question is about overexpression not happening, which suggests the protein isn't made at all.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's incorrect insertion (a missense) doesn't cause a stop codon, but the construct's overall expression is low. But the problem is that the construct's sequence includes a stop codon, so the ribosome stops early, leading to no full-length protein.

So the correct answer must be B: the ribosome terminated the translation early.


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence starts with the correct start codon (ATG) but contains a premature stop codon (TGA) downstream. This stop codon is likely introduced due to an error during the construction of the plasmid, such as a frameshift or a mutation during cloning. The presence of TGA in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein. This explains the lack of full-length GADD45G protein and, consequently, the failure to overexpress the protein.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.  
  While the HA tag sequence appears to have a mutation (e.g., the third codon is altered), this would primarily affect the recognition by HA-specific antibodies and not necessarily prevent protein expression. The issue here is the premature stop codon, not just the HA tag mutation.

- **Option B**: The ribosome terminated the translation early.  
  This is consistent with the presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated protein that is not functional or detectable as overexpressed.

- **Option C**: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.  
  While the absence of a linker could theoretically lead to proteolysis, the primary issue here is the premature stop codon, which prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized in the first place.

- **Option D**: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.  
  This is irrelevant because the premature stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA, and all organisms have mechanisms to recognize stop codons.

The most likely explanation for the lack of overexpression is the premature stop codon introduced into the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. 

**Answer: B**
