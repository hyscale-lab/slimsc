Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Let's see what I remember. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, wait, no, I think I misread that. Let me look again. Oh right, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some other terms? Or is it (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i? Hmm, the way it's written, maybe it's (a divided by the square root of (1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Or perhaps it's two separate terms: a/(sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, but the way it's written with the semicolon, maybe it's the real and imaginary parts. Wait, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, the question says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Hmm, but wave functions usually have their square modulus as the probability density. Oh wait, but wait, no, the wave function can be complex, and the probability density is the square of the absolute value, which is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

But the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found at x<1 or x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 and 3. Wait, that can't be right because the wave function here is given as a function of x, but the way it's written, it's a/(sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, which doesn't depend on x beyond 1 and 3. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, no, the wave function is only defined in a part of space where the particle can exist, between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but if x is between 1 and 3, then 1 + x is between 2 and 4. So the denominator is real and positive. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is a constant -0.5.

But the wave function being zero outside x=1 and x=3 would imply that the wave function must satisfy certain boundary conditions. For instance, when x approaches 1 from above, the wave function should be finite, and similarly when x approaches 3 from below.

Wait, but the given wave function isn't zero at x=1 or x=3. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is normalized between x=1 and x=3, such that the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 equals 1. Because, in quantum mechanics, the total probability must be 1.

So, the problem likely requires normalizing the wave function. Because when the wave function is normalized, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

Let me think about that. The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, no, perhaps ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Or maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) and then the imaginary part is -0.5. But I'm not sure. Let me read the question again.

The question says, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex number, with real part a/(sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + [ (-0.5) i ].

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because the imaginary part is a constant, not dependent on x. But okay, maybe that's the case.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. So in regions x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) =0. But for x between 1 and 3, ψ(x) is the given function. So that makes sense.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 +x )) - 0.5i. So for x >=1 and x<=3, ψ(x)= that. Elsewhere, zero.

Wait, but then when x approaches 3 from below, 1 +x is 4, so sqrt(4) is 2, so a/2. So the wave function is a/2 - 0.5i.

But for normalization, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + ( (-0.5) )^2 ].

So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

Breaking it into two terms: Integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

Integral of 0.25 dx is 0.25 x, evaluated from 1 to 3.

So putting it all together:

Integral from 1 to3 [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] + 0.25 (3 -1 ) = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

This must equal 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213, which is roughly 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial setup. Did I correctly compute the integral?

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = [ a/(sqrt(1+x)) ] - 0.5i. So |ψ(x)|² would be the square of the real part plus the square of the imaginary part, right? Because for a complex number a + bi, the modulus squared is a² + b².

So [a/(sqrt(1+x))]² + (0.5)^2.

Which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Yes, that's correct.

So integrating from 1 to3:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to3.

Which is a² (ln(3+1) - ln(1+1)) ) + 0.25*(3-1).

Which is a² ln(4/2) ) + 0.5.

Wait, 4/2 is 2, so ln(2).

So yes, same as before.

Thus, a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a²= 0.5/ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a≈0.849.

So the closest option is B) 0.85.

Alternatively, let me compute 0.5/ln(2).

Compute ln(2)=0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.72134752044.

Square root of that is sqrt(0.72134752044) ≈ 0.849.

So yes, 0.849 is approximately 0.85, so answer B.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we normalize the wave function. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). The total probability must equal 1, so we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:
1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2) \).
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25(x) \Big|_1^3 = 0.25(3-1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to \( 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), so the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \).

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + ( (-0.5) )^2 ].

So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

Breaking it into two terms: Integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

Integral of 0.25 dx is 0.25 x, evaluated from 1 to 3.

So putting it all together:

Integral from 1 to3 [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] + 0.25 (3 -1 ) = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

This must equal 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213, which is roughly 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be B.

Yes, that's correct.

Which is a² (ln(3+1) - ln(1+1)) ) + 0.25*(3-1).

Which is a² ln(4/2) ) + 0.5.

Wait, 4/2 is 2, so ln(2).

So yes, same as before.

Thus, a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a²= 0.5/ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a≈0.849.

So the closest option is B) 0.85.

Alternatively, let me compute 0.5/ln(2).

Compute ln(2)=0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.72134752044.

Square root of that is sqrt(0.72134752044) ≈ 0.849.

So yes, 0.849 is approximately 0.85, so answer B.
