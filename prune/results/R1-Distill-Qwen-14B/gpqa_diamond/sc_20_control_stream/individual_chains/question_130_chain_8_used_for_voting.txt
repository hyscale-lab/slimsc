Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, why does this absorption matter for the redshift?

So, when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs specific wavelengths, like the Lyman alpha. The observed wavelength of this absorption line depends on the redshift of the cloud relative to us. If the cloud is moving away (which it is, because of the expansion of the universe), the wavelength gets stretched, or redshifted.

The key point here is that to detect this absorption line using optical telescopes, the wavelength after redshift must be in the optical range. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it. So the redshifted Lyman alpha must fall into the optical wavelengths.

What's the Lyman alpha wavelength? It's 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers, right? Optical wavelengths are roughly from 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers. So the redshifted wavelength must be somewhere in that range. Let's figure out the minimum redshift needed to shift 0.1216 μm into 0.4 μm or higher.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. Wait, no, more accurately, the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So to find z, we rearrange: z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

If we want the observed wavelength to be just at the start of the optical, say 400 nm (0.4 μm), then let's plug in the numbers. λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So λ_obs is 400 nm. So z = 400 / 121.6 - 1.

Wait, let me compute that. 400 divided by 121.6 is approximately 3.3. So 3.3 minus 1 is 2.3. So z would be about 2.3. But wait, the options given are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. So I'm a bit off. Maybe I should be more precise.

Let me calculate 400 / 121.6 exactly. 121.6 times 3 is 364.8, which is less than 400. 121.6 * 3.3 = 399. The 3.3 gives 399, which is just under 400. So 3.3 would be 399, meaning to get 400, it's 3.305 or something. So z ≈ 2.305. So the redshift would need to be just over 2.3.

The question is asking for the lower limit, the minimum redshift. Because anything higher than that would also be detectable. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is right at the optical threshold, which is about 400 nm.

Looking at the options, the closest lower limit would be 2.3, but the options don't have that. Option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.3, and option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.3. Wait, but if the observed wavelength is longer than 400 nm, the redshift is higher. So for the lower limit, you need the minimal z that brings λ into optical. So if the minimal z is approximately 2.3, then the lower limit would be just over that. So any object with a higher z than 2.3 would be visible.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift for detection. So the minimal z is when λ_obs is 400 nm, which is z ≈2.3.

Looking at the options, the options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So 2.3 is close to option C, which is 2.4, but 2.4 is higher than 2.3. Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal z is around 2.3, so anything above that would be detectable. So the lower limit for detection would be z ≥2.3. So the minimal redshift is about 2.3. But the options don't have exactly that. So perhaps I should choose the next higher option, which is 2.4.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Another approach: the Lyman alpha is at 121.6 nm. Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (ultraviolet). So to bring 121.6 nm into 300 nm, what's the redshift?

z = (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 2.465. So that's a z of about 2.47. So if the cloud is at z=2.47, the Lyman alpha would be at 300 nm, which is just into the near-UV, but ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm because the atmosphere blocks it. Wait, no, actually, there are some windows in the atmosphere for UV, but ground-based optical telescopes are generally considered to observe from about 300 nm upwards. Or wait, maybe up to 300 nm is considered near-UV, and optical is 400 nm and above.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify the wavelength ranges.

The optical range is roughly 400-700 nm (visible light). Near-UV is about 300-400 nm. But ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm because the atmosphere absorbs those wavelengths. So for the Lyman alpha line (121.6 nm) to be observed in the near-UV, which is 300 nm, the redshift would need to be (300/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.465. So z≈2.47. So for the Lyman alpha to be observable from the ground, it must be redshifted to at least 300 nm, but optical telescopes can only go up to about 300 nm, perhaps? Or do I have that reversed?

Wait, no. Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. If the absorption is at 121.6 nm, but that's in the rest frame of the cloud. Then, the observed wavelength is longer. So for the absorption to be in the optical (so that it's detectable by optical telescopes), the observed wavelength must be in the optical range (400-700 nm).

Wait, but wait! No, no, the absorption is in the quasar's light. So if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's absorption would be at a redshifted wavelength. The cloud's own emission would be at a higher redshift, but the absorption is in the quasar's light. Wait, no, wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the quasar emits light. As this light passes through the hydrogen cloud, the cloud absorbs certain wavelengths. The cloud is between us and the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Wait, no, because the quasar is the background object, so the cloud is at a lower redshift. Or wait, no, if the cloud is in front of the quasar, then the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the absorption line we see is due to the cloud, which is at some z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher z_quasar.

Wait, but the question is about the cloud being detected. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption must be observed at a wavelength that is in the optical range. So the observed wavelength is λ = 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, but if the cloud is at z_cloud, then the absorption line we see is at 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud). Wait, no, no. Wait, the rest wavelength is 1216 A for the Lyman alpha line. So if the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is λ_obs = 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud).

But for this absorption line to be in the optical range (say, 4000 A to 7000 A, which is 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers), we need:

4000 A ≤ 1216 A (1 + z_cloud) ≤ 7000 A.

Solving for z_cloud.

So the lower limit would be when 1216 (1 + z_cloud) = 4000 A.

Let me compute that:

1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.290.

So z = about 2.29.

So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just a bit higher. Option D is 1.9, which is lower. So the lower limit is when z is at least approximately 2.29. So among the options, the next higher is option C (2.4), but the question is asking for the lower limit. So the minimal redshift is just above 2.29, so the lower limit is around 2.3. Since the options don't have 2.3, the next option is 2.4, so that's the minimal redshift that would bring the wavelength into the optical. Hence, the lower limit on redshift is 2.4.

Wait, but why did I calculate using 4000 A? Because 400 nm is 4000 A. So the observed wavelength needs to be at least 4000 A (400 nm) for optical telescopes to see it. So the minimal z is when λ_obs is 4000 A.

So 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000 → 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is z ≈ 2.29. So the minimal redshift is a bit over 2.29. So any cloud with z_cloud ≥ 2.29 would have its Lyman alpha absorption in the optical. So the lower limit is about 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29, so it's acceptable. But why is option D at 1.9? Let me see: if z=1.9, then λ_obs=1216*(2.9)=3526 A (352.6 nm), which is in the near-UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere blocks wavelengths below about 300 nm. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 352.6 nm is 3526 A, which is longer than 300 nm, so it's in the near-UV. But wait, I thought optical starts around 400 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 3526 A (352.6 nm), that's below 400 nm, which is the start of the optical. So ground-based telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere doesn't let through below about 300 nm, depending on the altitude and atmospheric conditions. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the atmosphere is opaque to most UV, but there are windows. The near-UV (say, 300-400 nm) is sometimes observed from high altitudes. So for an observed wavelength of 3526 A (352.6 nm), that's in the near-UV. So ground-based telescopes equipped with UV-capable instruments might observe that. But I think the question is considering optical telescopes, which typically don't go below about 300 nm. Or perhaps the question is considering that anything below 400 nm isn't considered optical. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's emission is redshifted such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical. So the quasar's emission is at a certain redshift, but the absorption line from the cloud is at a lower redshift.

Wait, no, that's not right. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the absorption line is at a wavelength longer than the quasar's own emission lines. Wait, no, the quasar's emission is at higher redshift than the cloud. So the absorption line is at a lower wavelength than the quasar's emission. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the quasar is at a higher redshift (z_q) than the cloud (z_cloud). The cloud is between us and the quasar. So the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which imprints absorption lines at a wavelength redshifted by the cloud's z.

So the absorption line we observe is at λ = 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud). So for that λ to be in the optical (say, 400 nm and above), we have 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 A.

So 1 + z_cloud >= 4000 / 1216 ≈3.29. So z_cloud >= 2.29.

So the minimal redshift of the cloud is about 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29. Among the options, the closest higher is 2.4 (option C). So the correct answer would be option C, 2.4.

Wait, but let me check again: when z_cloud is 2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 A (400 nm), which is in the optical. So any cloud with z >= 2.29 would have the Lyman-alpha absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the minimal redshift is just over 2.29. The options don't have that, so the next higher is 2.4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the lower limit as the point where the wavelength is in the optical range. So if the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption line would be in the near-UV, which can't be seen by optical telescopes. So the minimal z is when the observed wavelength is 4000 A.

So the correct answer is option C) 2.4.

Wait, but let me compute more precisely:

1216 * (1 + z) = 4000 → (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈3.29.

So z = 3.29 - 1 = 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is 2.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. The options don't have 2.29, but option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but since 2.4 is an option, that's the minimal z that brings the absorption line into the optical. Wait, no. No, because 2.4 is higher than 2.29, which would mean the absorption line is at a longer wavelength, which is still in the optical. So the minimal z is 2.29. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the next higher option, which is 2.4.

But another possibility: perhaps I'm confusing z of the quasar and the cloud. Let me think again. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. The cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For that to be in the optical (e.g., 400 nm), z_cloud needs to be at least about 2.29. So the minimal z_cloud is around 2.29. Hence, the correct answer would be the option closest to that, which is option C (2.4). But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so the absorption line would be at 1216*(2.9)=3526 A, which is 352.6 nm, which is in the near-UV. So optical telescopes wouldn't detect that.

So the conclusion is that the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, so the correct option is C) 2.4.

To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range (approximately 400–700 nm, or 4000–7000 Å). The relationship between the observed wavelength and the rest wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Rearranging for \(z\):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

For the Lyman alpha line (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\)) to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be at least \(4000 \, \text{Å}\) (the start of the optical range). Substituting these values:

\[
z = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift required is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the given options, the closest higher value is \(z = 2.4\), which ensures the Lyman alpha absorption line is redshifted into the optical range. Lower redshifts, such as \(z = 1.9\), would result in the absorption line being in the near-UV range (e.g., \(3526 \, \text{Å}\)), which is not detectable by optical ground-based telescopes due to atmospheric absorption.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(2.29\), and the correct answer is the next higher option, \(2.4\).
