Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're introducing a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine, but they can't overexpress the protein. Now, they're trying to figure out why the expression isn't happening.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand, which is the coding strand. Let me see the structure of this sequence. The first part is the ATG, which is the start codon. Then, after that, there's TAC, which is Tyrosine. Wait, but the hemagglutinin tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Oh, wait, the tag is added to the beginning of the protein. So the construct should start with the HA tag followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but the way the question describes, the HA sequence is introduced into the coding sequence at the N-terminus. So in the DNA, the HA tag would come before the GADD45G coding region. But looking at the sequence, does it start with the HA tag?

I'm a bit confused. The HA tag is a short peptide, right? So the DNA for the HA would come right after the start codon. Let me think about the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is typically something like YPYDVPDYA. So the mRNA would code for that, which would be the complementary DNA. Wait, wait, if I'm looking at the coding (plus) strand, the DNA would be the same as the mRNA but without the T/U difference. So the HA tag would have a specific DNA sequence.

Wait, let me think about the sequence given. The sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. Then TAC, which is Tyrosine. So the next codon is TAC, which is Y. The HA tag's first amino acid is Y, so that matches. Then CCATACGATGTT... Hmm. Wait, the HA tag is about 10 amino acids, so let me see the corresponding DNA.

The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's break that down into codons. Each amino acid is three nucleotides. So:

Y: TAC
P: CC
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCG
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

Wait, that's 9 codons. Let me write them in order:

TAC (Y)
CCC (P) Wait, wait, no. Let me get the correct codon for each.

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me check each amino acid's possible codons.

HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.

So:

Y: TAC or TAT
P: CCA, CCG, CCU (but DNA is TTA, TTG, etc. Wait no, wait in DNA it's the coding strand, so the DNA will be the same as mRNA, so for P, which is Proline, the codons are CCN (any N). So in DNA, the coding strand would have CCC or CCG.

So the first Y is TAC, then P is CCA, then Y again is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, then P is CCG, D is GAT, Y is TAC, and A is GCT.

So the HA tag DNA sequence would be:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, let me put that together without spaces: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence, what's after the ATG?

The sequence after ATG is TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, so the first part after ATG is TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACT... Hmm. Let me parse the start.

ATG is the start codon. Then TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), then GAT (D), GTT (V), then CCG (P), then ATC (I), TAC (Y), then GCT (A). Wait, that's the HA tag! So the first part is the HA tag, then the rest is the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but wait. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the construct should start with the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So in the DNA, the coding sequence would be: ATG [HA tag] [GADD45G sequence].

In the given sequence, after the ATG, we have TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT. That is the HA tag being correctly incorporated. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

The options say possible reasons. Let's look at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Hmm, if there's a mutation in the HA tag, perhaps it's not expressed. But looking at the sequence, the HA tag seems correct. Because the HA is YPYDVPDYA, which in DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, but wait. Let me check each part. The HA tag's DNA sequence is:

First codon: TAC (Y)
Second: CCA (P)
Third: TAC (Y)
Fourth: GAT (D)
Fifth: GTT (V)
Sixth: CCG (P)
Seventh: ATC (I) Wait, that's not right. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So after the fifth codon (V), the sixth should be P. So sixth is CCG (P), that's correct. Then seventh codon is D, which is GAT. Eighth is Y, TAC, ninth is A, GCT.

Wait, but in the given sequence, after the ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCG (P), ATC (I), TAC (Y), GCT (A). That's nine codons, which matches the HA tag. So the HA tag seems correctly incorporated. So Option A may not be the issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Why would that happen? If there's a stop codon upstream. Looking at the DNA sequence, after the HA tag and the GADD45G sequence, is there a stop codon before the end? The sequence ends with TGA. Wait, let me see. The last part is ...CGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but the construct is supposed to have the HA tag followed by the entire GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is correctly added, then the rest is GADD45G. So the entire GADD45G should be expressed. But if the construct has a stop codon in the middle, that's a problem.

Wait, in the given sequence, the end is ...CGAGTGA. Let me check.

Looking at the last part: ...GGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So the last part is ...CGAGTGA, which is the stop codon TGA, which is the third codon in that triplet.

Wait, the GADD45G gene's coding sequence typically doesn't end with a stop codon, because the transgene is supposed to be under a promoter and just the coding sequence, perhaps. But in this case, the construct includes a stop codon at the end, which is normal because the gene would have its own stop. Wait, but if the plasmid was correctly designed, the stop codon would be after the GADD45G sequence. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but the sequence after includes a premature stop codon.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is causing a problem. Let me think about the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame with the GADD45G. So the entire protein should be HA-GADD45G. So if the stop codon is correctly placed at the end, that's fine.

Wait, the given sequence includes the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence, and ends with TGA. So maybe that's correct. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing a problem in the ribosome. Like, perhaps the HA tag introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, looking again at the sequence. The HA tag is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT. So that's 9 codons. Then comes the GADD45G coding sequence. So after the HA, the next codon is AGA (R), then TCC (S), then AGT (S), etc.

Wait, no: the sequence after the HA is ATG (the start codon for GADD45G?), but wait, the HA is part of the same coding sequence. So the HA is part of the same ORF as GADD45G. So the HA starts at the ATG, then the HA tag is the first 9 codons, then the GADD45G follows.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the ORF. Let me check for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking through the sequence, after the HA tag, the GADD45G starts. Let me see if there's a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon before the end.

The sequence given ends with ...CGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So perhaps in the middle, there's another stop codon.

Hmm, let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the sequence. Let's scan through.

Looking for instances of TGA, TAA, TAG.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT AGA TCC AGT CCA GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCC TGG GAA GCG CTT GCA GGT GGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Wait, looking at the middle, I see 'TGA' occurs again. For example, partway through, the sequence has 'TGA' at positions: looking in the middle, around here:

Looking for 'TGA' in the sequence parts:

...GCCTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I see 'TGA' appears a few times. For example, looking at '...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGC...' - no TGA there. Let me check '...GCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Wait, the sequence has 'GAGTGA' towards the end, which is GAG TGA, so the TGA is a stop codon at the end. But earlier in the sequence, are there any other TGA?

Looking at the beginning: ATG TAC CCA ..., no TGA.

Then after the HA tag, it's AGA TCC AGT CCA GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCC TGG GAA GCG CTT GCA GGT GGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ... Oh wait, here I see GCA TGA. So that's the codon TGA after GCA. So that's a stop codon. So in the middle, there's a TGA, which would stop translation early.

Wait, this is a problem. Because if the GADD45G coding sequence includes a TGA codon in the middle, the ribosome would terminate translation prematurely, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Wait, the question is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. So if the construct has an internal stop codon, that would cause the protein to be shorter, or perhaps not expressed if the stop is in the HA region.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the beginning. The internal TGA would be in the GADD45G part. So the HA tag is correctly expressed, but then the GADD45G is truncated. So the overall protein may be present but not full-length, but the question says the overexpression isn't happening. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the TGA in the middle causes the ribosome to terminate early, so the HA tag isn't even expressed correctly. Or perhaps the construct isn't in frame, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, but the given sequence is in the same reading frame as the HA tag. Because the HA is 9 codons, then the GADD45G follows.

Wait, but the middle TGA would terminate translation, so the protein would be HA-tag plus some part of GADD45G, then stop. But the experimenters couldn't detect the overexpression, perhaps because the protein is not functional or the amount is too low. Or maybe the HA tag isn't present because the stop is before it.

Wait, no, the TGA is in the middle of the GADD45G part. So the HA would be expressed, then GADD45G starts but stops at TGA.

But the problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein. So maybe the presence of the early stop codon is causing the protein not to be made correctly, perhaps leading to degradation.

Wait, perhaps there's a premature stop codon in the HA tag region. Let me check the HA tag again.

The HA tag's DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, that's nine codons. The next codon is AGA (R), which is correct. But in the given sequence, after the HA, the next codon is AGA (R)... so no problem there.

Wait, but in the sequence provided, looking at the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT AGA TCC AGT CCA GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCC TGG GAA GCG CTT GCA GGT GGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ...

So the 9th codon after ATG is GCT, then the 10th is AGA (R), then TCC (S), etc.

Wait, the TGA is the 27th codon or something, in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. So the ribosome would stop there, making a shorter protein. But why isn't the protein expressed at all?

Wait, maybe the issue is that the TGA is in the wrong frame. No, because the HA is in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is causing a problem. For example, introducing a stop codon early in the HA.

Wait, let me check the HA tag codons again:

1. TAC (Y)
2. CCA (P)
3. TAC (Y)
4. GAT (D)
5. GTT (V)
6. CCG (P)
7. ATC (I)
8. TAC (Y)
9. GCT (A)

So the HA is correctly incorporated as 9 codons. Then the rest is GADD45G. But if there's a TGA in the middle of GADD45G, the protein would terminate there. So the HA would be present, but the GADD45G would be truncated. But the experiment is about GADD45G overexpression. So perhaps the construct is not making enough functional protein, hence not detectable.

But the question states that the researcher couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the expression is too low because the construct isn't working. So why isn't the construct working?

Another possibility is that the start codon is not in the right frame. Wait, the construct starts with ATG, which is correct. So that's not the issue.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Hmm. The HA tag is a short peptide, but without a linker, perhaps the protein is being degraded. But the HA tag is just a short sequence; I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon. All stop codons are recognized by the release factor, so if a stop codon exists, the ribosome stops. So if the DNA has a TAA, TAG, or TGA, that's a stop. So if the construct has a TGA (which is in the middle), the ribosome stops.

But why would the mouse not have a tRNA for UAA? Wait, because UAA is not a standard sense codon, but the ribosome doesn't need tRNA for stop codons. It uses release factors instead. So Option D is probably not the issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

That's because there's a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, like TGA.

So in the given DNA, the sequence has a TGA codon in the middle. So the ribosome would terminate there, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, but that would produce a shorter protein. So if the HA tag is expressed along with the beginning of GADD45G, but then stops, the overall protein might be expressed but not full-length. However, the researcher is trying to overexpress the full-length GADD45G (with HA tag), so perhaps the presence of the internal stop codon is causing the protein not to be expressed at all, or not enough to be detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the internal stop codon is causing the mRNA to be subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD targets mRNA with premature stop codons for degradation. So if the construct's mRNA has a premature stop codon, the mRNA might be degraded, leading to low or no protein expression.

In that case, the presence of the TGA in the middle would cause NMD, thus reducing the amount of protein expressed.

So the problem is that the construct has an internal stop codon, which is causing the mRNA to be degraded.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would explain the absence of the full-length protein, but why wouldn't any protein be expressed? If the stop is in the HA region, the HA wouldn't be expressed, but if it's in the GADD45G part, the HA would be expressed but the GADD45G would be truncated.

But in this case, the HA is correctly placed, and the stop is in the middle of GADD45G. So the HA would be expressed, but the GADD45G would be incomplete.

Wait, but the researcher is using the HA tag to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA is present but the GADD45G is missing, the purification might not work, leading to no protein detected.

But the problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein. So perhaps the presence of the internal stop is causing the mRNA to be unstable, so not much protein is made.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence is not correctly appended after the HA tag.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is causing a frameshift. Let me check the reading frame.

The HA tag is nine codons, so it's in a triplet frame. The GADD45G should follow in the same frame.

So if the HA is correctly in frame, then the rest should be as well.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence: does it have any in-frame stop codons in the HA region? No, because the HA is correctly in frame, as we saw.

But in the GADD45G region, there's a TGA. So that's a stop codon in the middle.

So why is the HA tag present but not the full-length GADD45G? Because the construct includes an internal stop codon.

In that case, the reason for the lack of overexpression is the presence of an internal stop codon, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early. So option B would be the cause.

But looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. Option C is about proteolysis due to a missing linker.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is added in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift.

Wait, no, the HA is correctly in frame, as per the sequence.

Wait, but wait a second. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So in the DNA construct, the HA is before the GADD45G. So the HA is part of the same ORF.

So if the HA is correctly in frame, the GADD45G should follow.

But the presence of a TGA in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, resulting in a truncated protein.

So the overall protein would be HA + part of GADD45G, but not the full length.

But the question says that the overexpression isn't happening. So perhaps the truncation is so severe that the protein is not functional, but it's still expressed. Or perhaps the presence of the stop codon leads to NMD, so the mRNA is degraded, leading to no protein.

So the problem is the presence of an internal stop codon in the construct, which the researcher didn't account for.

Looking at the options, which one relates to this?

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Yes, because the TGA is present, the ribosome stops early, so the protein isn't full-length. But why isn't the protein expressed at all? Maybe the truncated protein isn't detected with the antibody, or perhaps the HA tag isn't present because the stop is before it.

Wait, the stop is in the middle of GADD45G, so the HA is correctly expressed. So the protein would have the HA tag but not the full GADD45G.

But the question is about overexpression of GADD45G. So perhaps the construct isn't making enough of the full-length protein because the internal stop codon is causing the mRNA to be degraded.

In that case, the problem is that the mRNA has a premature stop codon, leading to NMD, so the mRNA isn't translated into a full-length protein.

So which option aligns with that?

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if the mRNA is translated, but the protein is truncated.

But if the mRNA is subject to NMD, the protein might not be made at all.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing a problem with the reading frame. Let me see: the HA is nine codons, so it's a multiple of three. So the frame is correct. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag has a stop codon within it. Let me check the HA tag's codons again.

HA tag is 9 codons: TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCG (P), ATC (I), TAC (Y), GCT (A).

None of these are stop codons. So the HA is correctly in frame and doesn't introduce a premature stop.

So the problem must be in the GADD45G part. The presence of a TGA in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated protein. So the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G is not.

Wait, but the HA is part of the same ORF, so the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G is only partially expressed.

So the construct isn't making the full-length protein, hence the overexpression isn't observed. The researcher is likely using an antibody against the HA tag to detect the protein. If the HA is present, why isn't the protein detected? Maybe because the HA is present but the GADD45G isn't, so the overall protein is not functional or not present in sufficient quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the HA tag messes with the GADD45G's structure, making it non-functional.

But the question states that the overexpression isn't happening, meaning the protein isn't being expressed at all.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the TGA is in the HA region. No, because the HA is correctly in frame and the TGA is in the GADD45G part.

Another angle: perhaps the stop codon is in the HA region. No, the HA codons don't have a stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is in the opposite orientation. No, because the construct's HA is at the N-terminus.

Wait, the problem is that the HA is followed by a stop codon. No, the stop is in the middle of GADD45G.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early because the tag includes a stop codon. But the HA doesn't have any stop codons in the given sequence.

Wait, let me recheck the HA codons. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So each codon is:

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCG
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

So none of these are stop codons. So that's not the issue.

So the only internal stop codon is in the GADD45G part, which is the TGA.

So the construct includes an internal TGA, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

So the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the ribosome is terminating translation early due to the presence of the TGA codon.

So the correct answer would be option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sequence lacks a linker, so the HA and GADD45G are not properly expressed. But that's option C.

Wait, the options are:

A) Missense mutation in HA

B) Ribosome stops early

C) No linker causing proteolysis

D) No tRNA for UAA

From all this, I think the issue is B: the presence of a TGA stop codon in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence causing the ribosome to terminate early, leading to no full-length protein being made. Therefore, the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with the HA determinant at the N-terminus. The provided DNA sequence starts with the ATG start codon, followed by the HA tag sequence and the GADD45G coding sequence. The issue is that the protein is not being overexpressed as expected.

### Key Analysis:
1. **HA Tag Sequence**:  
   The HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) is correctly incorporated into the DNA. The codons for the HA tag are in frame and do not introduce any stop codons. This rules out **Option A** (a missense mutation in the HA tag) as the cause.

2. **Internal Stop Codon**:  
   Scanning the DNA sequence reveals the presence of a TGA stop codon in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. This stop codon is positioned after the HA tag but before the end of the GADD45G sequence. The ribosome would terminate translation at this point, resulting in a truncated protein. This explains why the full-length protein is not being expressed, making **Option B** (the ribosome terminating early) a likely cause.

3. **Lack of Linker Sequence**:  
   The question does not provide evidence that the absence of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. While a linker can enhance protein stability, this is not the primary issue here, as the problem lies upstream in translation termination. This rules out **Option C**.

4. **tRNA for UAA**:  
   Stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. The presence of the TGA stop codon does not depend on the availability of a specific tRNA for UAA. This rules out **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue is the presence of an internal TGA stop codon in the GADD45G coding sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. This results in the production of a truncated protein, preventing the successful overexpression of the full-length GADD45G protein.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're introducing a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine, but they can't overexpress the protein. Now, they're trying to figure out why the expression isn't happening.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand, which is the coding strand. Let me see the structure of this sequence. The first part is the ATG, which is the start codon. Then, after that, there's TAC, which is Tyrosine. Wait, but the hemagglutinin tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Oh, wait, the tag is added to the beginning of the protein. So the construct should start with the HA tag followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but the way the question describes, the HA sequence is introduced into the coding sequence at the N-terminus. So in the DNA, the HA tag would come before the GADD45G coding region. But looking at the sequence, does it start with the HA tag?

I'm a bit confused. The HA tag is a short peptide, right? So the DNA for the HA would come right after the start codon. Let me think about the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is typically something like YPYDVPDYA. So the mRNA would code for that, which would be the complementary DNA. Wait, wait, if I'm looking at the coding (plus) strand, the DNA would be the same as the mRNA but without the T/U difference. So the HA tag would have a specific DNA sequence.

Wait, let me think about the sequence given. The sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. Then TAC, which is Tyrosine. So the next codon is TAC, which is Y. The HA tag's first amino acid is Y, so that matches. Then CCATACGATGTT... Hmm. Wait, the HA tag is about 10 amino acids, so let me see the corresponding DNA.

The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's break that down into codons. Each amino acid is three nucleotides. So:

Y: TAC
P: CC
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCG
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

Wait, that's 9 codons. Let me write them in order:

TAC (Y)
CCC (P) Wait, wait, no. Let me get the correct codon for each.

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me check each amino acid's possible codons.

HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.

So:

Y: TAC or TAT
P: CCA, CCG, CCU (but DNA is TTA, TTG, etc. Wait no, wait in DNA it's the coding strand, so the DNA will be the same as mRNA, so for P, which is Proline, the codons are CCN (any N). So in DNA, the coding strand would have CCC or CCG.

So the first Y is TAC, then P is CCA, then Y again is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, then P is CCG, D is GAT, Y is TAC, and A is GCT.

So the HA tag DNA sequence would be:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, let me put that together without spaces: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence, what's after the ATG?

The sequence after ATG is TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, so the first part after ATG is TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACT... Hmm. Let me parse the start.

ATG is the start codon. Then TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), then GAT (D), GTT (V), then CCG (P), then ATC (I), TAC (Y), then GCT (A). Wait, that's the HA tag! So the first part is the HA tag, then the rest is the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but wait. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the construct should start with the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So in the DNA, the coding sequence would be: ATG [HA tag] [GADD45G sequence].

In the given sequence, after the ATG, we have TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT. That is the HA tag being correctly incorporated. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

The options say possible reasons. Let's look at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Hmm, if there's a mutation in the HA tag, perhaps it's not expressed. But looking at the sequence, the HA tag seems correct. Because the HA is YPYDVPDYA, which in DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, but wait. Let me check each part. The HA tag's DNA sequence is:

First codon: TAC (Y)
Second: CCA (P)
Third: TAC (Y)
Fourth: GAT (D)
Fifth: GTT (V)
Sixth: CCG (P)
Seventh: ATC (I) Wait, that's not right. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So after the fifth codon (V), the sixth should be P. So sixth is CCG (P), that's correct. Then seventh codon is D, which is GAT. Eighth is Y, TAC, ninth is A, GCT.

Wait, but in the given sequence, after the ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCG (P), ATC (I), TAC (Y), GCT (A). That's nine codons, which matches the HA tag. So the HA tag seems correctly incorporated. So Option A may not be the issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Why would that happen? If there's a stop codon upstream. Looking at the DNA sequence, after the HA tag and the GADD45G sequence, is there a stop codon before the end? The sequence ends with TGA. Wait, let me see. The last part is ...CGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but the construct is supposed to have the HA tag followed by the entire GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is correctly added, then the rest is GADD45G. So the entire GADD45G should be expressed. But if the construct has a stop codon in the middle, that's a problem.

Wait, in the given sequence, the end is ...CGAGTGA. Let me check.

Looking at the last part: ...GGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So the last part is ...CGAGTGA, which is the stop codon TGA, which is the third codon in that triplet.

Wait, the GADD45G gene's coding sequence typically doesn't end with a stop codon, because the transgene is supposed to be under a promoter and just the coding sequence, perhaps. But in this case, the construct includes a stop codon at the end, which is normal because the gene would have its own stop. Wait, but if the plasmid was correctly designed, the stop codon would be after the GADD45G sequence. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but the sequence after includes a premature stop codon.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is causing a problem. Let me think about the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame with the GADD45G. So the entire protein should be HA-GADD45G. So if the stop codon is correctly placed at the end, that's fine.

Wait, the given sequence includes the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence, and ends with TGA. So maybe that's correct. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing a problem in the ribosome. Like, perhaps the HA tag introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, looking again at the sequence. The HA tag is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT. So that's 9 codons. Then comes the GADD45G coding sequence. So after the HA, the next codon is AGA (R), then TCC (S), then AGT (S), etc.

Wait, no: the sequence after the HA is ATG (the start codon for GADD45G?), but wait, the HA is part of the same coding sequence. So the HA is part of the same ORF as GADD45G. So the HA starts at the ATG, then the HA tag is the first 9 codons, then the GADD45G follows.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the ORF. Let me check for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking through the sequence, after the HA tag, the GADD45G starts. Let me see if there's a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon before the end.

The sequence given ends with ...CGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So perhaps in the middle, there's another stop codon.

Hmm, let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the sequence. Let's scan through.

Looking for instances of TGA, TAA, TAG.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT AGA TCC AGT CCA GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCC TGG GAA GCG CTT GCA GGT GGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Wait, looking at the middle, I see 'TGA' occurs again. For example, partway through, the sequence has 'TGA' at positions: looking in the middle, around here:

Looking for 'TGA' in the sequence parts:

...GCCTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I see 'TGA' appears a few times. For example, looking at '...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGC...' - no TGA there. Let me check '...GCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Wait, the sequence has 'GAGTGA' towards the end, which is GAG TGA, so the TGA is a stop codon at the end. But earlier in the sequence, are there any other TGA?

Looking at the beginning: ATG TAC CCA ..., no TGA.

Then after the HA tag, it's AGA TCC AGT CCA GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCC TGG GAA GCG CTT GCA GGT GGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ... Oh wait, here I see GCA TGA. So that's the codon TGA after GCA. So that's a stop codon. So in the middle, there's a TGA, which would stop translation early.

Wait, this is a problem. Because if the GADD45G coding sequence includes a TGA codon in the middle, the ribosome would terminate translation prematurely, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Wait, the question is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. So if the construct has an internal stop codon, that would cause the protein to be shorter, or perhaps not expressed if the stop is in the HA region.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the beginning. The internal TGA would be in the GADD45G part. So the HA tag is correctly expressed, but then the GADD45G is truncated. So the overall protein may be present but not full-length, but the question says the overexpression isn't happening. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the TGA in the middle causes the ribosome to terminate early, so the HA tag isn't even expressed correctly. Or perhaps the construct isn't in frame, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, but the given sequence is in the same reading frame as the HA tag. Because the HA is 9 codons, then the GADD45G follows.

Wait, but the middle TGA would terminate translation, so the protein would be HA-tag plus some part of GADD45G, then stop. But the experimenters couldn't detect the overexpression, perhaps because the protein is not functional or the amount is too low. Or maybe the HA tag isn't present because the stop is before it.

Wait, no, the TGA is in the middle of the GADD45G part. So the HA would be expressed, then GADD45G starts but stops at TGA.

But the problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein. So maybe the presence of the early stop codon is causing the protein not to be made correctly, perhaps leading to degradation.

Wait, perhaps there's a premature stop codon in the HA tag region. Let me check the HA tag again.

The HA tag's DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT.

Wait, that's nine codons. The next codon is AGA (R), which is correct. But in the given sequence, after the HA, the next codon is AGA (R)... so no problem there.

Wait, but in the sequence provided, looking at the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG ATC TAC GCT AGA TCC AGT CCA GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCC TGG GAA GCG CTT GCA GGT GGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ...

So the 9th codon after ATG is GCT, then the 10th is AGA (R), then TCC (S), etc.

Wait, the TGA is the 27th codon or something, in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. So the ribosome would stop there, making a shorter protein. But why isn't the protein expressed at all?

Wait, maybe the issue is that the TGA is in the wrong frame. No, because the HA is in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is causing a problem. For example, introducing a stop codon early in the HA.

Wait, let me check the HA tag codons again:

1. TAC (Y)
2. CCA (P)
3. TAC (Y)
4. GAT (D)
5. GTT (V)
6. CCG (P)
7. ATC (I)
8. TAC (Y)
9. GCT (A)

So the HA is correctly incorporated as 9 codons. Then the rest is GADD45G. But if there's a TGA in the middle of GADD45G, the protein would terminate there. So the HA would be present, but the GADD45G would be truncated. But the experiment is about GADD45G overexpression. So perhaps the construct is not making enough functional protein, hence not detectable.

But the question states that the researcher couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the expression is too low because the construct isn't working. So why isn't the construct working?

Another possibility is that the start codon is not in the right frame. Wait, the construct starts with ATG, which is correct. So that's not the issue.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Hmm. The HA tag is a short peptide, but without a linker, perhaps the protein is being degraded. But the HA tag is just a short sequence; I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon. All stop codons are recognized by the release factor, so if a stop codon exists, the ribosome stops. So if the DNA has a TAA, TAG, or TGA, that's a stop. So if the construct has a TGA (which is in the middle), the ribosome stops.

But why would the mouse not have a tRNA for UAA? Wait, because UAA is not a standard sense codon, but the ribosome doesn't need tRNA for stop codons. It uses release factors instead. So Option D is probably not the issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

That's because there's a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, like TGA.

So in the given DNA, the sequence has a TGA codon in the middle. So the ribosome would terminate there, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, but that would produce a shorter protein. So if the HA tag is expressed along with the beginning of GADD45G, but then stops, the overall protein might be expressed but not full-length. However, the researcher is trying to overexpress the full-length GADD45G (with HA tag), so perhaps the presence of the internal stop codon is causing the protein not to be expressed at all, or not enough to be detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the internal stop codon is causing the mRNA to be subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD targets mRNA with premature stop codons for degradation. So if the construct's mRNA has a premature stop codon, the mRNA might be degraded, leading to low or no protein expression.

In that case, the presence of the TGA in the middle would cause NMD, thus reducing the amount of protein expressed.

So the problem is that the construct has an internal stop codon, which is causing the mRNA to be degraded.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would explain the absence of the full-length protein, but why wouldn't any protein be expressed? If the stop is in the HA region, the HA wouldn't be expressed, but if it's in the GADD45G part, the HA would be expressed but the GADD45G would be truncated.

But in this case, the HA is correctly placed, and the stop is in the middle of GADD45G. So the HA would be expressed, but the GADD45G would be incomplete.

Wait, but the researcher is using the HA tag to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA is present but the GADD45G is missing, the purification might not work, leading to no protein detected.

But the problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein. So perhaps the presence of the internal stop is causing the mRNA to be unstable, so not much protein is made.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence is not correctly appended after the HA tag.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is causing a frameshift. Let me check the reading frame.

The HA tag is nine codons, so it's in a triplet frame. The GADD45G should follow in the same frame.

So if the HA is correctly in frame, then the rest should be as well.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence: does it have any in-frame stop codons in the HA region? No, because the HA is correctly in frame, as we saw.

But in the GADD45G region, there's a TGA. So that's a stop codon in the middle.

So why is the HA tag present but not the full-length GADD45G? Because the construct includes an internal stop codon.

In that case, the reason for the lack of overexpression is the presence of an internal stop codon, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early. So option B would be the cause.

But looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. Option C is about proteolysis due to a missing linker.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is added in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift.

Wait, no, the HA is correctly in frame, as per the sequence.

Wait, but wait a second. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So in the DNA construct, the HA is before the GADD45G. So the HA is part of the same ORF.

So if the HA is correctly in frame, the GADD45G should follow.

But the presence of a TGA in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, resulting in a truncated protein.

So the overall protein would be HA + part of GADD45G, but not the full length.

But the question says that the overexpression isn't happening. So perhaps the truncation is so severe that the protein is not functional, but it's still expressed. Or perhaps the presence of the stop codon leads to NMD, so the mRNA is degraded, leading to no protein.

So the problem is the presence of an internal stop codon in the construct, which the researcher didn't account for.

Looking at the options, which one relates to this?

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Yes, because the TGA is present, the ribosome stops early, so the protein isn't full-length. But why isn't the protein expressed at all? Maybe the truncated protein isn't detected with the antibody, or perhaps the HA tag isn't present because the stop is before it.

Wait, the stop is in the middle of GADD45G, so the HA is correctly expressed. So the protein would have the HA tag but not the full GADD45G.

But the question is about overexpression of GADD45G. So perhaps the construct isn't making enough of the full-length protein because the internal stop codon is causing the mRNA to be degraded.

In that case, the problem is that the mRNA has a premature stop codon, leading to NMD, so the mRNA isn't translated into a full-length protein.

So which option aligns with that?

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if the mRNA is translated, but the protein is truncated.

But if the mRNA is subject to NMD, the protein might not be made at all.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing a problem with the reading frame. Let me see: the HA is nine codons, so it's a multiple of three. So the frame is correct. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag has a stop codon within it. Let me check the HA tag's codons again.

HA tag is 9 codons: TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCG (P), ATC (I), TAC (Y), GCT (A).

None of these are stop codons. So the HA is correctly in frame and doesn't introduce a premature stop.

So the problem must be in the GADD45G part. The presence of a TGA in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated protein. So the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G is not.

Wait, but the HA is part of the same ORF, so the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G is only partially expressed.

So the construct isn't making the full-length protein, hence the overexpression isn't observed. The researcher is likely using an antibody against the HA tag to detect the protein. If the HA is present, why isn't the protein detected? Maybe because the HA is present but the GADD45G isn't, so the overall protein is not functional or not present in sufficient quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the HA tag messes with the GADD45G's structure, making it non-functional.

But the question states that the overexpression isn't happening, meaning the protein isn't being expressed at all.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the TGA is in the HA region. No, because the HA is correctly in frame and the TGA is in the GADD45G part.

Another angle: perhaps the stop codon is in the HA region. No, the HA codons don't have a stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is in the opposite orientation. No, because the construct's HA is at the N-terminus.

Wait, the problem is that the HA is followed by a stop codon. No, the stop is in the middle of GADD45G.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early because the tag includes a stop codon. But the HA doesn't have any stop codons in the given sequence.

Wait, let me recheck the HA codons. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So each codon is:

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCG
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

So none of these are stop codons. So that's not the issue.

So the only internal stop codon is in the GADD45G part, which is the TGA.

So the construct includes an internal TGA, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

So the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the ribosome is terminating translation early due to the presence of the TGA codon.

So the correct answer would be option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sequence lacks a linker, so the HA and GADD45G are not properly expressed. But that's option C.

Wait, the options are:

A) Missense mutation in HA

B) Ribosome stops early

C) No linker causing proteolysis

D) No tRNA for UAA

From all this, I think the issue is B: the presence of a TGA stop codon in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence causing the ribosome to terminate early, leading to no full-length protein being made. Therefore, the correct answer is B.


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with the HA determinant at the N-terminus. The provided DNA sequence starts with the ATG start codon, followed by the HA tag sequence and the GADD45G coding sequence. The issue is that the protein is not being overexpressed as expected.

### Key Analysis:
1. **HA Tag Sequence**:  
   The HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) is correctly incorporated into the DNA. The codons for the HA tag are in frame and do not introduce any stop codons. This rules out **Option A** (a missense mutation in the HA tag) as the cause.

2. **Internal Stop Codon**:  
   Scanning the DNA sequence reveals the presence of a TGA stop codon in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. This stop codon is positioned after the HA tag but before the end of the GADD45G sequence. The ribosome would terminate translation at this point, resulting in a truncated protein. This explains why the full-length protein is not being expressed, making **Option B** (the ribosome terminating early) a likely cause.

3. **Lack of Linker Sequence**:  
   The question does not provide evidence that the absence of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. While a linker can enhance protein stability, this is not the primary issue here, as the problem lies upstream in translation termination. This rules out **Option C**.

4. **tRNA for UAA**:  
   Stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. The presence of the TGA stop codon does not depend on the availability of a specific tRNA for UAA. This rules out **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue is the presence of an internal TGA stop codon in the GADD45G coding sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. This results in the production of a truncated protein, preventing the successful overexpression of the full-length GADD45G protein.

**Answer: B**
