Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. I'm a bit rusty on stability constants, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The given concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes, right? So each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. I remember that the stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex from its constituent ions.

The problem is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So we're looking for the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex.

First, I think I need to consider all possible complexes that can form. The complexes would be Co(SCN)_1^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3-, Co(SCN)_4^4-? Wait, no. Wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state. So the charges would adjust based on the number of SCN- (which is -1 each). So:

- Co^2+ + n SCN^- → Co(SCN)_n^(2−n+). Wait, no, let me think. Each SCN- is -1. So for n SCN-, the charge would be 2+ - n*1.

Wait, no, the complex would have charge 2+ - n*(−1) × (charge per SCN). Wait, SCN- is -1. So when you add n SCN-, each with -1 charge, the complex's charge is 2+ + (n)(-1) ?

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The formula of the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n*1}? Because each SCN- is -1. So n SCN- contribute a total of -n charge. The Co is +2, so the complex charge is 2+ - n. Hmm. So for example, n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (2-1=+1). n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (2-2=0). Wait, neutral? That can't be right because Co(II) with two SCN- would be neutral. Hmm. But the question says dithiocyanato, which I thought is two SCN- ligands, so that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}.

Wait, but in the options, the complexes are called dithiocyanato, so I'm focusing on the n=2 case. So the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^0 in the solution.

Stability constants β are given for each complex. β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, etc. So β1=9 is for [Co(SCN)]^+.

The problem is, when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of the species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. So the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, but in terms of the overall distribution, the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentrations.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (n=0,1,2,3,4) and then find the fraction for n=2.

But wait, let's think about the possible complexes. Since the Co is in +2 state, the possible complexes could be:

- [Co]^2+ (n=0)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4)

So there are five species in total, but not all may be possible. Wait, but in this problem, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, and the initial Co concentration is 0.01 M. But when calculating the distribution, we'll need to consider all possible complexes.

Wait, but the problem says the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, which includes all forms: free Co^2+, all the complexes. But the thiocyanate is in excess (0.1 M), so the formation of complexes is favored.

I think the key is to compute the distribution of each complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations.

The general approach is to model the system using the formation of each complex step by step, considering the formation constants. Alternatively, since there are multiple complexes, perhaps I can use the fraction of each species based on their β values and the concentrations.

Another approach is to consider that each step forms a complex, with β_n being the equilibrium constant for the nth step. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) can be considered as a series of reactions, each adding one SCN-. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is the product of the stepwise β's up to the nth step.

Wait, no, actually, the β given are for each complex. So β1 is for the first complex, which is [Co(SCN)]^+, and β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. Wait, no, wait. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, no, I think each β is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand. Or are they overall constants? Because the way the question states it, "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So I think each βn is the stepwise formation constant for the nth ligand.

Wait, no, more accurately, βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. Because βn = [complex]/([Co^(2−n)][SCN−]^n). So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), the βn is its stability constant.

So the way to calculate the fraction of each species is to compute their concentrations relative to all possible species.

So the fraction f_n of each complex is given by f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (Σ (β_m [SCN]^m)) ), but only for the possible m values.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that for each n, the concentration of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is equal to β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n. But the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

[Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2− = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Hmm, but this seems complicated because each term is interdependent. Alternatively, I can model the distribution using the formation constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula for the fraction of each complex. The fraction of each complex is the product of the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN- raised to the power of the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such products for all possible n.

But wait, the [Co^2+] is part of the denominator because each complex's concentration depends on it. Oh, because [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

Total Co = x + β1 [SCN]^1 x + β2 [SCN]^2 x + β3 [SCN]^3 x + β4 [SCN]^4 x = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So, factoring x out:

x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4) ) = c(Co).

Hmm, so x = c(Co) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4).

Once I have x, I can compute each [Co(SCN)_n] as βn [SCN]^n x.

Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c(Co) = (βn [SCN]^n x) / c(Co).

Substituting x from above, this becomes (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4).

So the fraction is (βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of β_m [SCN]^m for m=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, for m=0, the term is 1 (since β0 is 1, I suppose, as [Co^2+] is the free ion).

So the denominator is the sum over m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m, where β0 = 1.

So the fractions are calculated as (βn * [SCN]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of βm [SCN]^m).

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Calculate each term βm [SCN]^m for m=0,1,2,3,4.

Given β0 = 1 (since the free ion is the starting point), β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN] is 0.1 M.

So compute each term:

m=0: β0 * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

m=1: 9 * (0.1) = 0.9.

m=2:40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

m=3:63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

m=4:16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Wait, sum these up:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 → 2.3646.

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for m=2 (the dithiocyanato complex, n=2) is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646:

2.3646 × 0.169 is about 0.4 (because 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4). So 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is approximately 16.9%.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, I thought n=2 is the dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So this would be 16.9% of the total.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option D is 16.9%, which would be the fraction for n=2.

But wait, the possible complexes for Co(II) with thiocyanate would be:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16.

Wait, but the calculated fraction for n=2 is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the problem statement says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. So the pattern goes up to β3, then down at β4. So perhaps the highest fraction is at n=3.

Wait, but according to the calculations, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D. However, I'm a bit confused because the sum is dominated by the largest terms. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the denominator was 2.3646.

The term for m=0 (β0=1, [SCN]^0=1 → 1).

m=1: 9*0.1=0.9 → 1.9.

m=2: 40*0.01=0.4 → 2.3.

m=3:63 *0.001=0.063 →2.363.

m=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016 →2.3646.

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

For each m, the fraction is (βm [SCN]^m) / 2.3646.

So:

m=0: 1/2.3646 ≈0.423.

m=1:0.9/2.3646≈0.381.

m=2:0.4/2.3646≈0.169.

m=3:0.063/2.3646≈0.0266.

m=4:0.0016/2.3646≈0.000675.

Wait, so the fractions are about 42.3% (m=0), 38.1% (m=1), 16.9% (m=2), ~2.66% (m=3), and ~0.0675% (m=4).

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So according to this, it's about 16.9%, which is option D.

But the sum of all fractions should add up to 100%. Let me check the sum:

42.3 +38.1 =80.4.

+16.9 →97.3.

+2.66 →99.96.

+0.0675 →99.96 + 0.0675≈99.9975%, which is about 100%, considering rounding. So that makes sense.

But wait, wait. The fraction for m=2 is 16.9%, which is option D. But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which corresponds to m=1. So that's [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So the answer should be 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options are:

A) 42.3% → m=0.

B)25.6% → not in the options.

C)38.1% → m=1.

D)16.9% → m=2.

So the correct answer is D)16.9%.

But wait, why is the fraction for m=1 (n=1) 38.1%? That's the largest after m=0. But the question is about n=2, so D is the answer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the β values. Because in the calculation, the denominator includes all β terms, including for m=3 and m=4, but their contributions are small. So the distribution is highest for m=0, then m=1, then m=2, then m=3, and least for m=4.

Wait, but according to the fractions, the highest is m=0 (42.3%), then m=1 (38.1%), which would be the monomeric complex. So the answer for n=2 is 16.9%, option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D)16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻. The stability constants are provided as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the concentrations are [Co(II)] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
\]

Here, β₀ = 1 (for the free Co²⁺ ion), and the denominator is the sum of all terms for \( m = 0 \) to \( m = 4 \). The terms are calculated as follows:

- For \( m = 0 \): \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- For \( m = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- For \( m = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- For \( m = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- For \( m = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0, \( n = 2 \)) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
