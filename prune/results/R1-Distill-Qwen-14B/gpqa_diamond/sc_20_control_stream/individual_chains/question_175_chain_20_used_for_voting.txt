Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It oscillates, so it must radiate energy. The wavelength of this radiation is lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle from the z-axis.

The question asks for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the type of dipole or higher-order moment involved. Since it's a spheroid, maybe it's an electric dipole or quadrupole? Or perhaps a magnetic dipole? But wait, the problem says it's an oscillating charge distribution, so probably an electric dipole.

Electric dipole radiation has a specific angular dependence. The power radiated by an electric dipole is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, right? And the pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle, I think, depends on the angle theta.

The dipole radiation pattern is such that the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis (theta = 90 degrees), and it falls off as 1/(sin^4 theta) or something like that? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the angular dependence for a dipole. In dipole radiation, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by an expression proportional to (1/(4π ε0 c^2)) * (p''^2) * sin^2 theta, but wait, no, that's the expression for the intensity, maybe. Let me think again.

Wait, the intensity (power per unit area) for dipole radiation is proportional to sin^2(theta), but wait, isn't it actually proportional to sin^2(theta) in the case of a magnetic dipole? Or is it the opposite? Wait, no, wait. For an electric dipole, the far-field intensity (like the E-field) falls off as 1/r, but the intensity (which is E squared over impedance) would fall as 1/r². But that's the overall scaling. The angular dependence, I think for electric dipole is proportional to 1/(sin^4 theta) or something else. Wait, maybe it's more precise to think about the radiation pattern.

Wait, the radiation pattern for an electric dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees. The intensity in the far field is proportional to (sin^2 theta), right? No, wait, wait. Let me think about it correctly.

The electric dipole's far field E is given by E = (1/(4πε₀ c² r)) * (p * sin theta / (r)) * e^{i(kr - ωt)} multiplied by some terms. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the intensity. The intensity is proportional to E², so it's proportional to (p''^2) * (sin^2 theta) / r^4, I think. Oh wait, no, because the dipole's far field is E ~ (p sin theta) / r², so E² would be proportional to (p² sin² theta)/r^4. So the intensity (which is power per unit area) would depend on sin^2 theta, but that's the per unit solid angle consideration.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity multiplied by the area element. Wait, actually, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity (which is power per area) multiplied by the area per steradian. The area element in spherical coordinates is r² sin theta dtheta dphi. But for a given r, which is very large, the intensity is E²/(2μ₀ c) or something like that. But for the purpose of finding the fraction, the r dependence will cancel out because we're comparing at the same r.

Wait, the maximum power per unit solid angle occurs at theta where sin theta is maximum. For an electric dipole, the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, where sin theta is 1. So the maximum intensity is at theta=pi/2.

So, the function f(theta) would have a maximum at 90 degrees.

The power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2 theta. So, for any angle theta, the power is proportional to sin^2 theta.

Wait, no, wait. The dipole radiation pattern. I think I might be mixing electric and magnetic dipoles. Let me see. Electric dipole radiation has a pattern that peaks at 90 degrees, while a magnetic dipole (like a loop) has a pattern that peaks at 0 and 180 degrees.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Wait, for an electric dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole axis (theta=90). For a magnetic dipole, maximum along the axis (theta=0 and 180). So, back to the problem. The problem says it's an oscillating charge distribution, so it's an electric dipole.

So, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for an electric dipole is proportional to sin^2 theta. So, the maximum is when sin theta is 1, which is theta=90 degrees.

So, the maximum power A is the value at theta=90, which is f(theta=90) = 1 (since it's the maximum). Then, the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees would be [f(theta=30)/f(theta=90)] = [sin^2(30)]/[sin^2(90)] = [ (1/2)^2 ] / 1 = 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4. Wait, so the first part is 1/4.

Now, the second part: the form of f as a function of lambda. So, f is the power per unit solid angle, which is a function of lambda and theta.

In the radiation, the power per unit solid angle would depend on the square of the amplitude of the dipole moment's acceleration? Or more precisely, the second derivative of the dipole moment. Because Poynting vector depends on the time derivative.

But let's think about the scaling with lambda. The maximum power radiated (A) would depend on the square of the oscillation frequency, since the radiation from a dipole is proportional to (ω^4) and (dipole moment p)^2.

Wait, the power radiated by an electric dipole is given by P = ( ( (μ₀ p₀^2 ω^4 )/(12π ε₀ c^3 )) ) * sin^2 theta, where p₀ is the amplitude of the dipole moment. But wait, I'm not exactly remembering the formula correctly.

Wait, the average power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is P_avg = (1/(12π ε₀ c^3)) * (d^2 p/dt^2)^2. Assuming the oscillation is harmonic, d^2 p/dt^2 = -p ω² sin(ω t), so the square is p^2 ω^4 sin²(ω t). The average over time would be p^2 ω^4 / 2.

Wait, so P_avg = (p^2 ω^4 )/(24 π ε₀ c^3 )).

Wait, but that's the total power. The power per unit solid angle (which is f) would be P_avg multiplied by sin^2 theta, I think.

Wait, no. Wait, the total power is the integral over all solid angles of the power per unit solid angle. So, the total power A is the integral of f(θ) over all angles. So,

A = ∫ f(θ) sinθ dθ dφ.

But for a dipole, f(θ) is proportional to sin^2θ, so:

A = ∫ [k sin^2θ] sinθ dθ dφ = k ∫ sin^3θ dθ ∫ dφ.

The phi integral is 2π. The theta integral is from 0 to pi: ∫ sin^3θ dθ = 4/3.

So, A = k * (4/3) * 2π. But the point is, the maximum value of f is at theta=90 degrees, which is f_max = k * (sin^2 90) )= k.

So, the function f(theta) is (P_avg / A) ) * sin^2 theta. Wait, no: because the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So, the maximum value of f is at theta=90, and that's equal to (P_avg) * (sin^2 90) / (something). Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently.

Alternatively, the function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, which in the case of a dipole is ( (p^2 ω^4)/(something) ) * sin^2 theta.

But the problem says that the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So, we need to find how f depends on lambda.

The wavelength lambda is related to the frequency ω by lambda = 2π c / ω. So, ω = 2π c / lambda.

So, ω^4 is proportional to (1/lambda^4), because omega is proportional to 1/lambda.

Therefore, f(theta) = (some constants) * (1/lambda^4) * sin^2 theta.

So, the function f is proportional to lambda^-4.

Wait, but wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So, let's think about dimensional analysis.

Power is energy per time. So, per unit solid angle, it's power per steradian.

But the function f depends on lambda and theta. So, the form is f(theta) = B * lambda^a * sin^2(theta). Or perhaps f is proportional to (some terms) multiplied by lambda^a.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (ω^4) p^2. So, and since ω = c/(lambda/2π) ), so ω = 2π c/lambda. So, ω^4 is (2π c)^4 / lambda^4. So, f(theta) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * sin^2 theta.

So, the function f is proportional to lambda^(-4) multiplied by sin^2 theta. Therefore, the form of f is lambda^-4.

So, putting it all together: the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30 is 1/4, and the form of f is lambda^-4.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 1/4, lambda^-4.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. The charge distribution radiates energy at a wavelength \(\lambda\), and the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   The charge distribution is oscillating, so it radiates electromagnetic energy. For an electric dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\). The maximum power radiated occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin^2\theta = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2\theta = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength \(\lambda\)**:  
   The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency. Since \(\omega = \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda}\), \(\omega^4 \propto \lambda^{-4}\). Thus, the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), which represents the power per unit solid angle, is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the above analysis, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\), and the form of \(f\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). This matches **Option C**.

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\), and the function \(f\) scales as \(\lambda^{-4}\).
