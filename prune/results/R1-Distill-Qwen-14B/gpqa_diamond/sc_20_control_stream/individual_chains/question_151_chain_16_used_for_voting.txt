Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about calculating the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's probably a vector in three-dimensional space. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector in a Hilbert space, typically represented as a column vector. So the state vector here is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write that down. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait, so P looks like this:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Let me quickly check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's see: the (1,2) element is 1/√2, and the (2,1) is also 1/√2. The (1,3) is 0 and (3,1) is 0. The (2,3) is 1/√2 and (3,2) is 1/√2. So yes, P is symmetric, which implies it's Hermitian. So that's good; it's a valid observable.

The question asks for the probability of measuring 0. Wait, but what are the possible outcomes of measuring P? The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the matrix P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P to see what possible values we can get, and then find the probability of getting 0.

Alternatively, sometimes in quantum mechanics, the observable might be a projection operator. Wait, but looking at P, does it look like a projection matrix? Let's think. For a projection matrix, say onto a subspace, it should be idempotent, meaning P^2 = P. Let's test that. Hmm, considering the structure of P, perhaps it's a projection onto some subspace. Because the diagonal elements are zero except none. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to compute the eigenvalues.

So, to find the eigenvalues of P, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix P - λI:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. The determinant can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) 
- (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
+ 0 * det(...)

So the first term is -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ (λ² - (1/2)).

The second term is - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ] = - (1/√2) * ( -λ/√2 ) = - (1/√2)(-λ/(√2)) ) = ( λ )/(2 )

The third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2 ) = 0

Let me expand this:

-λ^3 + (λ/2 ) + (λ/2 ) = 0

Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly. The determinant is:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ) + 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding. Let me re-calculate the determinant step by step.

The minor for the (1,1) element is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ, 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) )= λ² - (1/2).

So the first term is (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Wait no, wait: the first term is -λ multiplied by (λ² - 1/2), which is -λ³ + (λ * 1/2). Hmm, wait, no:

Wait, no. The first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ * 1/2) ? No, wait. Wait, the first term is computed as (element) * (-1)^(i+j) * minor. Wait, in the expansion, the sign alternates. So for a 3x3 matrix, the expansion along the first row is:

sum_{j=1 to 3} [ (-1)^(1+j) * element (1,j) * det(minor) ]

So for element (1,1), the sign is (+) because 1+1=2, even. So it's (+1) * (-λ) * det(minor). Then element (1,2): sign is (-) because 1+2=3, odd. So it's (-1)*(1/√2)*det(minor). Element (1,3): sign is (+), but the element is zero.

So the determinant is:

( (-λ) * det(minor11) ) 
- (1/√2) * det(minor12)
+ 0

So minor11 is the 2x2 matrix for the elements not in row 1, column 1:

[ -λ, 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Which has determinant λ² - (1/2).

So first term is (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Now the minor12 is for element (1,2): the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2:

[ 1/√2, 1/√2 ]
[ 0, -λ ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) )= -λ / √2.

So the second term is - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2 ) = - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2 ) = (λ ) / (2 ).

Putting it all together, the determinant equation is:

(-λ^3 + (λ/2 )) + (λ/2 ) = 0

So combining terms:

-λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor out λ:

λ (-λ² + 1) ) = 0

So the eigenvalues are λ=0, and then the equation becomes -λ²+1=0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, wait. Let me see: the equation is λ (-λ^2 + 1) )=0 → λ=0, or -λ² +1=0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is about the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 and compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector, then square its magnitude to get the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps P can be diagonalized, and the probability is the sum of the squares of the components in the eigenbasis.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is since P is a projection operator. Because in quantum mechanics, sometimes observables are projection matrices. Let me check: for a projection matrix, P² = P. Let's see if that's true here.

Compute P squared. Let me compute P^2.

P is:

Row 1: [0, a, 0], where a=1/√2

Row 2: [a, 0, a]

Row3: [0, a, 0]

So P squared would be P × P.

Let me compute the (1,1) element: Row 1 of P · Column 1 of P.

(0)(0) + a*(a) + 0*0 = a² = (1/2)

Similarly, (1,2) element: Row 1 · Column 2.

0*(a) + a*(0) + 0*(a) = 0.

(1,3): Row1·Column3 = 0*0 + a*(a) + 0*0 = a² = 1/2.

Now, let's compute (2,1) element: Row 2 · Column 1.

a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

(2,2): Row2 · Column2.

a*(a) + 0*0 + a*(a) = a² + a² = 2a² = 1.

(2,3): Row2 · Column3.

a*0 + 0*(a) +a*0 = 0.

(3,1): Row3 · Column1.

0*0 +a*a +0*0 = a²=1/2.

(3,2): Row3 · Column2.

0*a +a*0 +0*a=0.

(3,3): Row3 · Column3.

0*0 +a*a +0*0 = a²=1/2.

So P squared is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Which is not equal to P. So P is not a projection operator. So that approach might not help directly.

So back to finding the eigenvectors for λ=0.

The eigenvalue equation is (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So we can write the system of equations from (P |v> ) = 0.

Let me write down the equations.

Looking at the P matrix:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) )= 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Row3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero. From row 2, v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

So any vector like [a, 0, -a]^T is an eigenvector for λ=0, where a is a scalar.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional (since there are two parameters, but v2=0 and v3=-v1, so it's a line).

So the eigenvectors can be written as a [1, 0, -1]^T multiplied by a scalar.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [1,0,-1]^T scaled by 1/sqrt(2), because the norm squared is (1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 )= 2 → so normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].

So the eigenvector |v> for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

We need to find the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector |v>.

The projection is given by ( |v> <v| ) |ψ> .

The inner product <v|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · [-1, 2, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) ( -1 + 0 -1 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) (-2) )= -2/sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product: | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but that can't be possible because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, wait what's the issue here.

Wait, no. Because the eigenvector |v> is normalized, so the inner product is the amplitude, and the probability is the square of |amplitude|.

Wait, but if I compute the inner product as <v|ψ>, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Calculating the dot product: 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

So <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2) )= -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2). The probability is |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot to normalize |ψ>?

Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized (the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components is 1). Let me check the state vector.

The given state is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute its norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized.

So the actual state should be |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Ah! So I forgot to normalize the state vector. That's where I went wrong.

So the correct state is |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, recalculate the inner product <v|ψ>.

v is [1, 0, -1 ] / sqrt(2).

So <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]

Dot product:

(1)(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1)(1/sqrt(6)) ) 

= (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(6)) ) 

= (-2)/sqrt(6).

So <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2)/sqrt(6) )= (-2) / sqrt(12) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The probability is |<v|ψ>|^2 = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1/3.

So the correct answer should be C.

The problem involves calculating the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \) for a given quantum state. The state vector is \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \), and the observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
To find the possible outcomes of measuring \( P \), we determine its eigenvalues by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( \lambda \), we get:

\[
\lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

Thus, the possible outcomes are \( 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvalue equation \( P |v\rangle = 0 \) gives the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(v_1 + v_3) = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From these, \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_3 = -v_1 \). The eigenvector is therefore of the form \( |v\rangle = a[1, 0, -1]^T \), where \( a \) is a scalar. Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[1, 0, -1]^T.
\]

### Step 3: Projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v\rangle \)
The state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}[-1, 2, 1]^T.
\]

The projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v\rangle \) is given by the inner product:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[1, 0, -1] \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}[-1, 2, 1].
\]

Calculating the dot product:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot (-1 + 0 - 1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-2}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the magnitude of this inner product:

\[
P(0) = |\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
