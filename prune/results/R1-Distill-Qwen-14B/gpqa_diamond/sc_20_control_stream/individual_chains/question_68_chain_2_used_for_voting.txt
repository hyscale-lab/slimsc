Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian should involve the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So when the field is in the Z direction, the Hamiltonian would be proportional to Sz, right? And when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy.

But wait, the initial state is with the field along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with the field, so it's in the eigenstate of Sz. That makes sense because when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by Sz.

So initially, the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. Then, when the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. That changes the basis of the system. Now the states are eigenstates of Sy.

But how does this affect the expectation value of Sz? Oh, right, because when you change the Hamiltonian, the state doesn't change immediately, but the expectation values can oscillate over time due to the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian.

I think I should model this using time-dependent quantum mechanics. The system is initially in an eigenstate of Sz, but after the field changes, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian, and we'll look at how <Sz> changes over time.

Let me write down the Hamiltonian before and after. Initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. Wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma * Sz, and the energy is -mu·B. So in the Z direction, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B = -gamma B Sz. But wait, I might have the sign wrong. The energy is usually written as H = -mu·B. But in some treatments, the Hamiltonian is written as H = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction of the field. Hmm, but let me make sure. Oh, I think the correct expression is H = -μ·B, so if μ = γ S (or γ Sz in the initial case), then H_initial = -γ B Sz.

Wait, but when the field is along Z, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. So the initial state is |+z> or |-z>? Well, since the field is in +Z, and the particle's moment is aligned, the spin is up along Z, so the state is |+z>.

Then, the field is turned off and the new field is along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, because mu is the vector, so H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues s times the Pauli matrices. For spin 1/2, S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but in this case, I think the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma B (S · n).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as H = -gamma B Sy. Because the field is along Y direction, so the dot product becomes Sy.

So the system starts in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field changes, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Now, the state will evolve under this H.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but in this case, since we're dealing with spin-1/2, ħ is often taken as 1 in these units, so perhaps H is in units of energy, and time is scaled accordingly. So maybe H is written as H = -omega Sy, where omega is gamma B.

Wait, let me think. Let me calculate the energy levels. The eigenvalues of Sy for spin-1/2 are ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues -gamma B (± ħ/2) = ± (-gamma B ħ / 2). Wait, actually, the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2 times some factor. Wait, no, Sy is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B * (ħ/2)(+1) and -gamma B * (ħ/2)(-1) ). So that's ± (gamma B ħ/2) but multiplied by -1.

Wait, that's not right. Let me redo that. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So H = -gamma B Sy, so its eigenvalues are -gamma B * (+ħ/2) and -gamma B * (-ħ/2) ). So H has eigenvalues -gamma B ħ/2 and +gamma B ħ/2.

But wait, when the system is in an eigenstate of Sy, the energy is fixed, but when it's in a superposition, the state will evolve with time.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. So we can express this state in terms of the eigenstates of Sy.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

I remember that |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me write that correctly. The eigenstates for Sy are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me compute that. Let me write |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

Substituting the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = a [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + b [ (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Grouping terms:

= (a + b) |+z> / sqrt(2) + (a - b) |-z> / sqrt(2)

Since |+z> is orthogonal to |-z>, the coefficients must match.

So, for |+z>:

Coefficient of |+z> is (a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1

Coefficient of |-z> is (a - b)/sqrt(2) = 0

From the second equation, (a - b) = 0 → a = b.

Substituting into the first equation: (a + a)/sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a = sqrt(2) → a = sqrt(2)/2.

But wait, that can't be right because sqrt(2)/2 is about 0.707, which squared would be 0.5. Let me compute:

If a = b, then (a + a)/sqrt(2) → (2a)/sqrt(2) = a * sqrt(2) = 1 → a = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, correct. Because 2a / sqrt(2) = a * sqrt(2).

So a = 1/sqrt(2), b = 1/sqrt(2).

Thus, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, substituting a=1/sqrt(2) and b=1/sqrt(2), then:

|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) |-y>

Which is correct, because when you add |+y> and |-y>, each has equal parts |+z> and |-z>, so their sum would have more |+z> contribution.

Wait, let's see:

( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )

Wait, because |+y> is (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2).

So, adding them and multiplying by 1/sqrt(2):

[ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

= [ 2|+z> ] / 2 → |+z>

Yes, that's correct. So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Now, when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) and E_minus = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute H |+y>.

H |+y> = (-gamma B Sy) |+y> = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) ) |+y> → because Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly for |-y>, H |-y> = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) ) |-y> → (gamma B ħ/2) |-y>.

So the energy eigenvalues are E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_minus = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the signs. Let's think again.

The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is H = -mu · B. So when the field is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.

So H = -gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± (ħ/2) * 1 (since Sy = (ħ/2) sigma_y). So Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, and |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>? Wait, no, the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>, and H |-y> = -gamma B (-ħ/2) |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_minus = gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy levels are symmetrically placed around zero.

Now, the initial state is |psi(0)> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So when time evolves, each component will pick up a phase factor based on its energy. So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = (e^(-i E_plus t / ħ ) |+y> + e^(-i E_minus t / ħ ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_plus and E_minus:

= ( e^(-i [ -gamma B (ħ/2) ] t / ħ ) |+y> + e^(-i [ gamma B (ħ/2) ] t / ħ ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Simplify the exponents:

The exponent for the first term is (-i) * (-gamma B (ħ/2) t ) / ħ = i gamma B (t/2 )

Similarly, the second term's exponent is (-i) * (gamma B (ħ/2) t ) / ħ = (-i) gamma B (t/2 )

So the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of the spin.

Sz is represented by the Pauli matrix sigma_z multiplied by ħ/2.

So the expectation value <Sz> is ( ħ/2 ) times the expectation value of sigma_z in state |psi(t)>.

Let me compute the expectation value <sigma_z>:

⟨ psi(t) | sigma_z | psi(t) ⟩

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

sigma_z can be written in the basis of |+y> and |-y> as a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the expansion of |psi(t)>.

But let me think: What is sigma_z when expressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion of sigma_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express |psi(t)> in the Sz basis and then compute the expectation.

Wait, |+y> and |-y> can be written as combinations of |+z> and |-z>.

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So |psi(t)> is:

[ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify this:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) )

sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so denominator is 2.

Expanding the numerator:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |-z> ] / 2

Factor out the expressions:

The first term's coefficient is (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) = 2 cosθ, where θ = gamma B t/2.

The second term's coefficient is (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) = 2i sinθ.

So:

= [ 2 cosθ |+z> + 2i sinθ |-z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cosθ |+z> + i sinθ |-z>

So |psi(t)> = cosθ |+z> + i sinθ |-z>, where θ = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of sigma_z is:

⟨ sigma_z ⟩ = |+z|² (1) ) + |i sinθ|^2 ( -1 ) + cross terms.

Wait, no, because sigma_z |+z> = |+z>, sigma_z |-z> = -| -z>.

Wait, more accurately, for a state alpha |+z> + beta |-z>, the expectation value is |alpha|^2 (1) + |beta|^2 (-1) + (alpha beta* + beta alpha*) (0), because the cross terms involve off-diagonal elements which are zero for sigma_z.

So in our case:

alpha = cosθ, beta = i sinθ.

Compute |alpha|^2 = cos²θ,

|beta|^2 = |i sinθ|^2 = sin²θ,

So <sigma_z> = cos²θ * 1 + sin²θ * (-1) = cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ).

So expectation value of sigma_z is cos(2θ).

But theta is gamma B t/2. So 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, <sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t).

But we're looking for the expectation value of Sz, which is (ħ/2) times <sigma_z> → (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but the question says mu = gamma Sz, so the magnetic moment mu_z is gamma * Sz. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so S is in units of spin operators. Hmm, perhaps I should make sure.

Wait, the question states mu = gamma * S_z. So mu_z = gamma * S_z. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says "magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz)".

So mu is equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma Sz. So mu_z is gamma S_z.

But the question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment, which would be <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

Since <S_z> is (ħ/2) times <sigma_z>, because S_z = (ħ/2) sigma_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

But earlier we found <sigma_z> = cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).

Wait, wait, in the calculation above, theta was gamma B t/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t. So <sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t).

So <mu_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question says mu equals gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) <sigma_z> = (gamma ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the units. Let's think again.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator S has components S_x, S_y, S_z, each with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the expectation value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>, which is gamma * ( ħ/2 ) <sigma_z>.

In the calculation above, <sigma_z> is cos( gamma B t ), because <sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t).

So <mu_z> = (gamma * ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, in the problem statement, the options are given in terms of gamma B, so perhaps there's a simplification here.

Wait, but earlier I had:

<sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t )

So <mu_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, in the time evolution, the phase involved gamma B. So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait, the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma*B.

So the answer should be option B, gamma*B.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So in cos(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B divided by 2π. Hmm, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, let me think. The time dependence in <mu_z> is proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is gamma*B, which is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, is to be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field switches to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$, as the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, as:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\pm \hbar/2$, so the energy eigenvalues of $H$ are:
   \[
   E_+ = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2}, \quad E_- = \gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2}.
   \]
   The state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle\right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. To compute $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, the state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is expressed in the $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$ basis:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\theta)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\theta)|-z\rangle,
   \]
   where $\theta = \gamma B t / 2$. The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) = \cos(2\theta).
   \]
   Substituting $\theta = \gamma B t / 2$, we find:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the expectation value of $\mu_z$ oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \gamma \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the coefficient of $t$ in the cosine term, which is $\gamma B$. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian should involve the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So when the field is in the Z direction, the Hamiltonian would be proportional to Sz, right? And when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy.

But wait, the initial state is with the field along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with the field, so it's in the eigenstate of Sz. That makes sense because when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by Sz.

So initially, the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. Then, when the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. That changes the basis of the system. Now the states are eigenstates of Sy.

But how does this affect the expectation value of Sz? Oh, right, because when you change the Hamiltonian, the state doesn't change immediately, but the expectation values can oscillate over time due to the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian.

I think I should model this using time-dependent quantum mechanics. The system is initially in an eigenstate of Sz, but after the field changes, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian, and we'll look at how <Sz> changes over time.

Let me write down the Hamiltonian before and after. Initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. Wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma * Sz, and the energy is -mu·B. So in the Z direction, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B = -gamma B Sz. But wait, I might have the sign wrong. The energy is usually written as H = -mu·B. But in some treatments, the Hamiltonian is written as H = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction of the field. Hmm, but let me make sure. Oh, I think the correct expression is H = -μ·B, so if μ = γ S (or γ Sz in the initial case), then H_initial = -γ B Sz.

Wait, but when the field is along Z, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. So the initial state is |+z> or |-z>? Well, since the field is in +Z, and the particle's moment is aligned, the spin is up along Z, so the state is |+z>.

Then, the field is turned off and the new field is along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, because mu is the vector, so H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues s times the Pauli matrices. For spin 1/2, S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but in this case, I think the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma B (S · n).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as H = -gamma B Sy. Because the field is along Y direction, so the dot product becomes Sy.

So the system starts in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field changes, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Now, the state will evolve under this H.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but in this case, since we're dealing with spin-1/2, ħ is often taken as 1 in these units, so perhaps H is in units of energy, and time is scaled accordingly. So maybe H is written as H = -omega Sy, where omega is gamma B.

Wait, let me think. Let me calculate the energy levels. The eigenvalues of Sy for spin-1/2 are ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues -gamma B (± ħ/2) = ± (-gamma B ħ / 2). Wait, actually, the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2 times some factor. Wait, no, Sy is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B * (ħ/2)(+1) and -gamma B * (ħ/2)(-1) ). So that's ± (gamma B ħ/2) but multiplied by -1.

Wait, that's not right. Let me redo that. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So H = -gamma B Sy, so its eigenvalues are -gamma B * (+ħ/2) and -gamma B * (-ħ/2) ). So H has eigenvalues -gamma B ħ/2 and +gamma B ħ/2.

But wait, when the system is in an eigenstate of Sy, the energy is fixed, but when it's in a superposition, the state will evolve with time.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. So we can express this state in terms of the eigenstates of Sy.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

I remember that |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me write that correctly. The eigenstates for Sy are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me compute that. Let me write |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

Substituting the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = a [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + b [ (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Grouping terms:

= (a + b) |+z> / sqrt(2) + (a - b) |-z> / sqrt(2)

Since |+z> is orthogonal to |-z>, the coefficients must match.

So, for |+z>:

Coefficient of |+z> is (a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1

Coefficient of |-z> is (a - b)/sqrt(2) = 0

From the second equation, (a - b) = 0 → a = b.

Substituting into the first equation: (a + a)/sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a = sqrt(2) → a = sqrt(2)/2.

But wait, that can't be right because sqrt(2)/2 is about 0.707, which squared would be 0.5. Let me compute:

If a = b, then (a + a)/sqrt(2) → (2a)/sqrt(2) = a * sqrt(2) = 1 → a = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, correct. Because 2a / sqrt(2) = a * sqrt(2).

So a = 1/sqrt(2), b = 1/sqrt(2).

Thus, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, substituting a=1/sqrt(2) and b=1/sqrt(2), then:

|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) |-y>

Which is correct, because when you add |+y> and |-y>, each has equal parts |+z> and |-z>, so their sum would have more |+z> contribution.

Wait, let's see:

( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )

Wait, because |+y> is (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2).

So, adding them and multiplying by 1/sqrt(2):

[ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

= [ 2|+z> ] / 2 → |+z>

Yes, that's correct. So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Now, when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) and E_minus = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute H |+y>.

H |+y> = (-gamma B Sy) |+y> = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) ) |+y> → because Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly for |-y>, H |-y> = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) ) |-y> → (gamma B ħ/2) |-y>.

So the energy eigenvalues are E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_minus = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the signs. Let's think again.

The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is H = -mu · B. So when the field is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.

So H = -gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± (ħ/2) * 1 (since Sy = (ħ/2) sigma_y). So Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, and |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>? Wait, no, the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>, and H |-y> = -gamma B (-ħ/2) |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_minus = gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy levels are symmetrically placed around zero.

Now, the initial state is |psi(0)> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So when time evolves, each component will pick up a phase factor based on its energy. So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = (e^(-i E_plus t / ħ ) |+y> + e^(-i E_minus t / ħ ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_plus and E_minus:

= ( e^(-i [ -gamma B (ħ/2) ] t / ħ ) |+y> + e^(-i [ gamma B (ħ/2) ] t / ħ ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Simplify the exponents:

The exponent for the first term is (-i) * (-gamma B (ħ/2) t ) / ħ = i gamma B (t/2 )

Similarly, the second term's exponent is (-i) * (gamma B (ħ/2) t ) / ħ = (-i) gamma B (t/2 )

So the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of the spin.

Sz is represented by the Pauli matrix sigma_z multiplied by ħ/2.

So the expectation value <Sz> is ( ħ/2 ) times the expectation value of sigma_z in state |psi(t)>.

Let me compute the expectation value <sigma_z>:

⟨ psi(t) | sigma_z | psi(t) ⟩

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

sigma_z can be written in the basis of |+y> and |-y> as a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the expansion of |psi(t)>.

But let me think: What is sigma_z when expressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion of sigma_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express |psi(t)> in the Sz basis and then compute the expectation.

Wait, |+y> and |-y> can be written as combinations of |+z> and |-z>.

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So |psi(t)> is:

[ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify this:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) )

sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so denominator is 2.

Expanding the numerator:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |-z> ] / 2

Factor out the expressions:

The first term's coefficient is (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) = 2 cosθ, where θ = gamma B t/2.

The second term's coefficient is (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) = 2i sinθ.

So:

= [ 2 cosθ |+z> + 2i sinθ |-z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cosθ |+z> + i sinθ |-z>

So |psi(t)> = cosθ |+z> + i sinθ |-z>, where θ = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of sigma_z is:

⟨ sigma_z ⟩ = |+z|² (1) ) + |i sinθ|^2 ( -1 ) + cross terms.

Wait, no, because sigma_z |+z> = |+z>, sigma_z |-z> = -| -z>.

Wait, more accurately, for a state alpha |+z> + beta |-z>, the expectation value is |alpha|^2 (1) + |beta|^2 (-1) + (alpha beta* + beta alpha*) (0), because the cross terms involve off-diagonal elements which are zero for sigma_z.

So in our case:

alpha = cosθ, beta = i sinθ.

Compute |alpha|^2 = cos²θ,

|beta|^2 = |i sinθ|^2 = sin²θ,

So <sigma_z> = cos²θ * 1 + sin²θ * (-1) = cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ).

So expectation value of sigma_z is cos(2θ).

But theta is gamma B t/2. So 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, <sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t).

But we're looking for the expectation value of Sz, which is (ħ/2) times <sigma_z> → (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but the question says mu = gamma Sz, so the magnetic moment mu_z is gamma * Sz. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so S is in units of spin operators. Hmm, perhaps I should make sure.

Wait, the question states mu = gamma * S_z. So mu_z = gamma * S_z. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says "magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz)".

So mu is equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma Sz. So mu_z is gamma S_z.

But the question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment, which would be <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

Since <S_z> is (ħ/2) times <sigma_z>, because S_z = (ħ/2) sigma_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

But earlier we found <sigma_z> = cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).

Wait, wait, in the calculation above, theta was gamma B t/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t. So <sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t).

So <mu_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question says mu equals gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) <sigma_z> = (gamma ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the units. Let's think again.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator S has components S_x, S_y, S_z, each with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the expectation value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>, which is gamma * ( ħ/2 ) <sigma_z>.

In the calculation above, <sigma_z> is cos( gamma B t ), because <sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t).

So <mu_z> = (gamma * ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, in the problem statement, the options are given in terms of gamma B, so perhaps there's a simplification here.

Wait, but earlier I had:

<sigma_z> = cos(gamma B t )

So <mu_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, in the time evolution, the phase involved gamma B. So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait, the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma*B.

So the answer should be option B, gamma*B.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So in cos(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B divided by 2π. Hmm, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, let me think. The time dependence in <mu_z> is proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is gamma*B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, is to be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field switches to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$, as the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, as:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\pm \hbar/2$, so the energy eigenvalues of $H$ are:
   \[
   E_+ = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2}, \quad E_- = \gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2}.
   \]
   The state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle\right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. To compute $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, the state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is expressed in the $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$ basis:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\theta)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\theta)|-z\rangle,
   \]
   where $\theta = \gamma B t / 2$. The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) = \cos(2\theta).
   \]
   Substituting $\theta = \gamma B t / 2$, we find:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the expectation value of $\mu_z$ oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \gamma \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the coefficient of $t$ in the cosine term, which is $\gamma B$. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.
