Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data. Let's see what I can remember and how to approach this.

First, let me read the question carefully. The chemist found a white solid, and there's some spectral info provided. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%). Then there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, molecular ion peaks usually correspond to the molecular weight. But then the other peak is higher. Could that be a chlorine isotope? Because Cl has a significant natural abundance of its isotopes. Chlorine-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%. So if the molecular formula includes a Cl, the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z corresponding to Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Wait, so let's think about the molecular weights of the options. Let's compute each.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5=5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. So total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. So M+ would be around 156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, which fits. But why is there a peak at 158? Oh, because Cl has two isotopes. So the molecular ion would split into M and M+2. So for a molecule with one Cl, the M peak would be at 156 (Cl-35) and M+2 would be 158 (Cl-37). The abundance would be 75% and 25%, but the question says 100% and 32%. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because (the M peak is 100% and M+2 is about 32%? That would imply that Cl is present, but the ratios don't match exactly.)

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and another peak at 158, which is 32% of that. So 158 is M+2, which would be 156 + 2 = 158. So that supports the presence of a chlorine atom. Because Cl-37 is about 24.2% abundant. So in a molecule with one Cl, the M would be 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37) would be 24.2% of the M peak. But in the data, the M peak is 100% at 156, and the M+2 is 32% which is higher than 24.2%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula has two Cl atoms? Let's check.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A? Wait, no. Benzoic acid has COOH. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as A? Wait, no. Let me count: 4-chloro would be Cl attached to benzene, benzoic acid is benzene ring with COOH. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is again 12*7=84 +5=5 +35.5=35.5 +16*2=32. Total 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So same as before. The M+ would be 156 and M+2 at 158. So the abundance for M+ would be 75% (Cl-35) and M+2 25% (Cl-37). So the question has 32% for 158. Hmm, that's not matching exactly, but maybe it's close enough, or maybe the question is approximate.

Wait, the mass spec data shows 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. So M is 100% (156), M+2 is 32% of M. Wait, that would be 32% of the 156 peak? Or is it the height? Because in mass spectrometry, the ratio is typically M+2 / M = (abundance of Cl-37)/(abundance of Cl-35) * (M/(M+2)), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the peaks. Let me calculate the expected ratio for one Cl atom.

Cl has about 75% Cl-35 and 24.2% Cl-37. So in the mass spectrum, the ratio of M+2 to M would be approximately (24.2/75) * (1/(1+24.2/75)). Wait, maybe it's better to think that for each Cl atom, the M peak is 75% and M+2 is 24.2%. So the ratio of M+2 to M would be 24.2 / 75 ≈ 0.323, which is about 32.3%. So in the data, the M+2 is 32% as a peak. That fits well with the presence of one Cl atom. So the molecular weight is 156.5, but in the question it's 156 for M. So that makes sense because the molecular ion can round to the nearest integer. So the molecular formula must have one Cl. So looking at the options, all options except C) have Cl except D?

Wait, no. Let's check each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure: benzene ring with Cl at position 3, hydroxyl (OH) at position 2, and aldehyde (CHO) at position 1? Wait, no, benzaldehyde is usually in position 1. So perhaps positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So that's possible.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure: ClCO-O-phenyl. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-. So the structure would be OCl-CO-O-phenyl? Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-benzene. So the formula would be C6H5O2Cl. Wait, C6H5ClCOO-? Wait, no, chloroformate is O=C(OCl)O-phenyl? No, I think it's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2Cl. Wait, same as benzoic acid?

Wait, let's compute the molecular weight for each option.

Option A: C7H5ClO2. So 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. So total 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So M+ would be 156, M+2 158. Fits the data.

Option B: Same as A? 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2, same formula as A? Wait, no. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Wait, no. Wait, benzene ring (C6H5) plus COOH (COOH is -C(O)OH). So C7H6O2. But when you substitute a Cl for a H on the benzene, it becomes C6H5ClCOOH? No, wait. Let me think. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH, which is C7H6O2. If you have 4-chlorobenzoic acid, it's C6H4ClCOOH, which is C7H5ClO2. So same formula as A. So molecular weight same as A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula is C6H5O2Cl (since it's O=C(OCl)-O-Ph? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So for R = phenyl (C6H5), the formula is C6H5O2Cl. So same formula as A and B. So molecular weight same. So M would be 156. So all three options (A, B, C) have the same molecular weight, so the mass spec data doesn't help distinguish between them. Hmm, but then what about the other data.

Wait, the other option is D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So structure is Cl in position 2 of the benzoic acid ring. The formula would be C7H5ClO2, same as others. So same molecular weight. So the mass spec doesn't help, because all options have same molecular weight and same Cl. So need to look at other data.

Now, looking at IR data: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which suggests O-H stretching. Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So what kind of carbonyl gives 1720?

In carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1 but can be broader due to hydrogen bonding. Wait, but in the IR, the strong sharp peak is at 1720. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or acid chloride. Wait, acid chloride has a higher carbonyl stretch, around 1800 cm^-1. So 1720 would fit with an ester or maybe a ketone, but the presence of O-H suggests it's either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde, or maybe an alcohol.

Wait, but let me see. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H stretch would be broad, which is what the IR shows. Wait, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is typical for O-H stretch in carboxylic acids or alcohols. But 3500-2700 is a big range. Maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H (except maybe if it's something like a hemiacetal, but that's not the case here). So, wait, the broad peak is probably from O-H. Then the 1720 would be the carbonyl.

So, for option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a benzaldehyde group, which is an aldehyde. Aldehydes typically have a strong, sharp peak around 1720 cm^-1. But wait, the O-H in an aldehyde would be... no, wait, no. Aldehydes don't have O-H bonds. Unless it's an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group, like in A. So in this case, the compound is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group and a Cl. So the O-H would be from the hydroxyl (phenolic or aldehyde?), but wait, no: the hydroxyl is on the benzene ring, so it's a phenol group. So that would be a phenolic O-H, which is broad. So the IR would have a broad peak for the phenolic O-H, and the aldehyde's C=O would be around 1720. That fits the data.

But wait, let's think about other options. Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That would have a COOH group. The O-H in COOH is broad, and the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1, perhaps a bit lower. But the data says 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Also, benzoic acid might have a lower carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe in the solid state, the carbonyl could be a bit higher.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl would be around 1720, which fits. The O-H? Wait, no, chloroformate doesn't have an O-H. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. So if it's phenyl chloroformate, which is O=C(OCl)-O-Ph, then no O-H groups. So why the broad peak? Unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the IR is showing an O-H somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an aliphatic O-H. But phenyl chloroformate is an acyl chloride derivative, which doesn't have O-H. So perhaps the IR data doesn't fit option C.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, but the Cl is in position 2. So the IR would have a broad O-H from the COOH group and a carbonyl around 1700. But the data says 1720, which is higher.

Wait, but then what about the 1H NMR data?

The NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

So, in the NMR, a singlet at 11 ppm. That's a high chemical shift. What gives that? Phenolic O-H? Or an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, it's 11.0 ppm, which is higher. Wait, but also, the singlet could be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Actually, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, as singlets. But wait, in DMSO, the CDCl3 is not used for carboxylic acids because they are usually deprotonated under such conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is in a different solvent, or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: an exchangeable proton like an acidic OH. Let's think about the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So it has a hydroxyl group (phenolic) and an aldehyde group. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But the singlet at 11 ppm is even higher. So maybe it's the phenolic O-H? But phenolic O-H protons are usually broad, not sharp. Wait, but the NMR peak is labeled as (s, 1H), which is a singlet. Phenolic protons are usually broad due to exchange, but perhaps in this case, it's deuterated or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But 11 ppm is higher than average for aldehydes. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's think about the NMR peaks.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH would have a proton at around 11-12 ppm, as a singlet. The aromatic protons would be in the 7-8 ppm region. The d, 2H and another d, 2H suggest a para-substituted ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are each split into doublets, integrating to 2H each. So if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (if substituent is at 4), but wait, wait: benzoic acid is at position 1, and Cl is at position 4. So the ring would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the neighboring protons would be at positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to Cl, and positions 3 and 5, which are meta. Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally.

Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. So the COOH is at position 1, the Cl is at position 4. So the ring is 1 (COOH), 4 (Cl). So the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. The protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, perhaps. But the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe it's a para-substituted ring where the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the H in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, each as a doublet, and the H in positions 3 and 5 would be another set, but perhaps not present because of substitution. Wait, but in this case, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons: the two ortho (positions 2 and 6) to COOH, and the two meta (positions 3 and 5) to Cl.

Wait, perhaps the NMR is showing two doublets: one for the H ortho to COOH and another for H meta to Cl. Let me think about the coupling. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the H in position 2 would be adjacent to H in position 6. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the H in positions 2 and 6 are each split into doublets by their neighboring H. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are at 1 and 4. The H in positions 2 and 6 are adjacent (ortho) to substituent at 1. Wait, perhaps the H in positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, each as a doublet because they are next to another H. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 4. So the substituents are across from each other (para). So the H at position 2 is next to substituent 1 (COOH), and the H at position 6 is also next to substituent 1. Similarly, the substituent at 4 (Cl) affects H at position 3 and 5.

In such a case, the H at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and their chemical shifts would be similar. Each would couple with the H at position 3 (if any). Wait, no, position 3 is meta to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4.

Wait, perhaps the NMR is showing two sets of doublets: one for H ortho to substituent 1 (COOH), and another for H ortho to substituent 4 (Cl). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 1 (COOH) and another at position 4 (Cl), making the ring have symmetrical H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is showing a coupling pattern that suggests a para-substituted ring. The two doublets each integrate to 2H, so it's likely that the substituents are para to each other.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which could be the COOH proton. Then the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, making the ring have two sets of two equivalent H's each.

Let me think about option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would be Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. So the ring substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Therefore, the H's in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH and would be deshielded, maybe around 8.02 ppm. The H's in positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl and perhaps around 7.72 ppm. So each of these pairs would be as doublets because of coupling with adjacent H's.

In that case, the NMR would have a singlet at 11.0 ppm (COOH proton), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (H2 and H6), and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (H3 and H5). That seems to fit the data.

Now, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents at 2 (Cl) and 1 (COOH). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent. In this case, the ring would have H's at positions 3,4,5,6. The H at position 3 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. The H at position 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the splitting. Maybe the NMR would show more complex splitting, but perhaps there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data for option B fits better.

Wait, what about option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So substituents at position 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the structure would be 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. The aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me imagine the benzene ring: position 1 is CHO, position 2 is OH, position 3 is Cl. So the substituents are adjacent to each other. The remaining positions are 4,5,6. So H at 4 would be adjacent to H5 and H3 (Cl), and H at 6 would be adjacent to H5 and H1 (CHO). Hmm, the splitting would be more complex. Also, the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but the 11.0 ppm is higher. Plus, the aldehyde would be a singlet, but perhaps if there's a coupling, but aldehyde protons are usually not split much.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the aromatic ring is para to the O-CO-OCl group? Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituent is an O-CO-Cl group attached to the benzene ring. So the ring would have substituent at position 1: O-CO-Cl. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,4,5,6. But the substituent is a strong de-shielding group, so the protons ortho and para to it would be downfield. However, the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H. That suggests that the ring has substituents that cause the remaining H's to split into two sets of two. If the substituent is at position 1, then the H's at 2 and 6 would be ortho, and H's at 3 and 5 would be meta, and H4 would be para. So in this case, the NMR would show a triplet of doublets or something more complex, but the data shows two doublets each of 2H. So perhaps it doesn't fit.

Wait, but let me think again. If the substituent is O-CO-Cl, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, the H's ortho and para to it would be deshielded. In this case, the H's ortho (2 and 6) would have a higher chemical shift, perhaps around 8 ppm, and the H's para (4) would have a higher shift, and the meta H's (3 and 5) would be in a different region. But the data shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests that the substituent is in a position that creates two sets of equivalent H's, each with two H's. That would happen if the substituent is at position 1, making the H's at 2 and 6 equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 equivalent. But then H4 would be a singlet, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the substituent is at position 4, so making the ring have symmetry. Wait, but in that case, the H's would be in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data doesn't support option C, because it doesn't have an O-H group, but the IR shows a broad O-H stretch, which C doesn't have. So that probably rules out option C.

So, back to the options. Option B seems to fit the NMR data. Let me recap: the NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the COOH proton. Then two doublets, each 2H, which would correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents. The IR has a broad O-H from the COOH and a sharp C=O peak, which matches benzoic acid. The mass spec with M=156 and M+2=158 fits a molecule with one Cl.

Wait, but what about option A? If it's 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet. But that's at 11.0, which is higher than usual for an aldehyde. Also, the aromatic protons would be in specific positions. Let me think: the structure would be CHO at position 1, OH at 2, Cl at position 3. Then the H's at 4,5,6 would be present. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which might not fit this arrangement. Because the substituents are not para to each other, but meta. So the aromatic protons might not split into two doublets. So perhaps the NMR data doesn't fit option A.

So, based on the NMR, the 11 ppm singlet is likely a COOH proton. So that points to option B or D.

Wait, the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720, which for benzoic acid is a bit high. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700 cm^-1. But in the data, it's 1720, which is higher. So maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has a higher carbonyl. Or maybe a ketone, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, another option: if the compound is an acid chloride. Then the carbonyl would be higher, around 1800 cm^-1. But in the data, it's 1720, which is lower than that. So maybe it's a different group.

Wait, going back. The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is O-H. So it's either a carboxylic acid, a phenol, or an alcohol. For a phenol, the O-H is less acidic than carboxylic acid, so the O-H peak in IR is usually broader and perhaps at a lower frequency. But the data shows a broad peak in that range, so both possibilities are there.

If it's a phenol (option A), then the carbonyl would be from the aldehyde group, which is around 1720 cm^-1, which fits. So in that case, the NMR would have the phenol O-H as a broad peak (but in the question, the NMR doesn't show any broad peaks, only sharp ones). Wait, but the NMR data doesn't mention any broad peaks, only singlet and doublets. So perhaps the O-H is exchanging and not observed in the NMR, or it's deuterated. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde's proton is at 11 ppm, but that's high for an aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option's spectral data.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

- Mass: M=156, M+2=158. Fits.
- IR: Broad O-H (phenol), and aldehyde C=O at ~1720. Fits.
- NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) → could be aldehyde? No, aldehyde is usually 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, the phenolic O-H is deprotonated? Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, no. Alternatively, it's the aldehyde. But 11 ppm is high. Alternatively, maybe it's the phenol O-H, but that would be a broad peak, which isn't indicated here.
- The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, perhaps. But considering substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), the H's at 4,5,6 would have varying environments.

Wait, maybe the H's at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, giving a doublet. But I'm not confident.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: same as above.
- IR: Broad O-H (carboxylic acid), C=O at ~1720. Fits.
- NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, COOH proton). Aromatic H's as two doublets. Fits. So this seems to match well.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass same.
- IR: same as B.
- NMR: The substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the aromatic H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But how would they split? H3 and H6 would be adjacent to substituent 2 (Cl), and H4 and H5 would be adjacent to substituent 1 (COOH). So perhaps H3 and H6 would be a doublet each, but the integration would be 1H each, but the data shows each as 2H. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's some symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the NMR of 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

The structure would be Cl at position 2, COOH at 1. So positions 3 and 6 would have H's. Wait, no, benzene is a ring. Position 1: COOH. Position 2: Cl. So the H's are at positions 3,4,5,6. H3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2), H4 is meta to Cl and adjacent to H5, H5 is adjacent to COOH, and H6 is adjacent to H5 and H1 (COOH). Hmm, this seems more complicated. The aromatic protons might not split into two doublets of 2H each.

Therefore, perhaps option B's NMR data fits better.

Putting it all together: the molecular ion and M+2 fit a molecule with one Cl. The IR has O-H (broad) and C=O (1720). The NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH), and two doublets of 2H each (aromatic protons). So option B fits all data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest the presence of one chlorine atom, as the isotopic abundance of chlorine-37 (~24.2%) matches the relative intensity of the M+2 peak. The molecular weight of the compound is therefore approximately 156 g/mol.

The **IR spectrum** shows a broad peak in the range **3500–2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests the compound contains either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde group.

The **¹H NMR spectrum** provides the following data:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: This is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, as it is typically deshielded and appears as a singlet.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, where the two sets of protons are equivalent and split into doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Contains a hydroxyl group (phenolic O-H) and an aldehyde group.  
   - The aldehyde proton typically appears around 9–10 ppm, but the singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton.  
   - The aromatic protons would not split into two doublets of 2H each due to the meta arrangement of substituents.  
   - **Does not fit the NMR data.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine substituent on the benzene ring.  
   - The singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the carboxylic acid proton.  
   - The broad O-H stretch in the IR corresponds to the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carbonyl stretch.  
   - The two doublets in the NMR (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm) correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - **Fits all spectral data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph).  
   - The IR would show a carbonyl stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹, but there is no O-H group to account for the broad peak in the IR spectrum.  
   - The NMR would not show a singlet at 11.0 ppm, as phenyl chloroformate lacks a carboxylic acid proton.  
   - **Does not fit the IR or NMR data.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine substituent on the benzene ring.  
   - The singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the carboxylic acid proton.  
   - However, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons, inconsistent with the two doublets observed in the NMR.  
   - **Does not fit the NMR data.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data (mass spectrometry, IR, and NMR) are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**, the M+2 peak at **m/z = 158**, the broad O-H stretch in the IR, the sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, and the NMR data all align with this structure.

**Answer: B**
