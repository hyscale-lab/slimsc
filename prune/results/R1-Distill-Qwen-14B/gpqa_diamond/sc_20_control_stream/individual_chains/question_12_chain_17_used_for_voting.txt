Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. So, Pi(+) is at rest initially. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Oh right, because the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

The masses given are the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are really light, almost massless. So I can probably treat the neutrino as having zero mass. That should simplify things.

So the problem is about finding the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino after the decay. But wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy is going to be really high because it's massless. Hmm, but let me think about the energy conservation here.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi(+) because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon has rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV, and its total energy is the sum of its rest mass and kinetic energy. The neutrino's total energy would just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

So energy conservation equation: Energy of Pi(+) = Energy of muon + Energy of neutrino.

So, 139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + K_mu) + K_nu.

But I also have to use the momentum conservation. Since Pi is at rest, the momenta of mu and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude.

The energy of each particle is related to their momentum and mass. For the muon, the total energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² → but since we're working in units where c=1, it's just sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²). Similarly, for the neutrino, since mass is zero, energy is just p_nu.

Because p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), let's call this common value p.

So, the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and the neutrino's energy is p.

So substituting back into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

Hmm, that's a tricky equation to solve for p. Let me write it down:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p + p².

So,

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

The p² terms cancel out:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

Moving terms around:

2 *139.6 p = 139.6² - 105.7².

Let me compute each term numerically.

139.6 squared: Let's see,

140^2 = 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, but wait, 139.6 is in MeV, so (139.6)^2 = (139.6)^2. Let me compute that accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

Let's compute 140 *140 = 19600.

But since it's 139.6, that's 140 *140 minus (0.4 *140 *2) minus (0.4)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 139.6 *139.6.

Hmm, 139.6 * 139.6 = ?

Let me think:

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100² is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

So,

2 *139.6 p = (19488.16) - (11172.49) = 8315.67 MeV².

Therefore, p = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6).

2 *139.6= 279.2.

So p= 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 279.2: 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me calculate:

279.2 × 29 ≈ 279*30=8370, but 29 is 279.2 ×29=8096.8. Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, 279.2 × 29.8 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376, minus 0.2 *279.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16.

Hmm, so 279.2 ×29.8 ≈8320.16. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less. So p≈29.8 - (8320.16 -8315.67)/(279.2).

The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49. So 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So p≈29.8 -0.016≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units here: since the rest masses are in MeV/c², and p is in MeV/c. So p = 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is just p, which is approximately 29.784 MeV.

The energy of the muon is sqrt(p² + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute that.

29.784^2 ≈ 887.1 (since 30^2=900, so 29.784 is a bit less, about 887.1).

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So adding: 887.1 + 11172.49 = 12059.59.

Square root of 12059.59: sqrt(12059.59) ≈ let's see, 110^2=12100, so it's about 109.8 (since 109.8^2= (110-0.2)^2=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04), which is close to 12059.59.

So sqrt(12059.59) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So the muon's total energy is approximately 109.8 MeV.

But its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7=4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again. Because when I computed sqrt(887.1 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.59)= approximately 109.807 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.807 -105.7=4.107 MeV.

And the neutrino's KE is p, which is ~29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations to make sure.

Wait, when I computed 2*139.6*p = 139.6² -105.7² = 19488.16 - 11172.49=8315.67.

So p=8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do that division again. 279.2 × 29=8096.8. 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So 29 + 0.783=29.783. So p≈29.783 MeV/c.

So neutrino KE is 29.783 MeV.

Muon's total energy: sqrt(29.783^2 + 105.7^2) = sqrt(887.09+11172.49)=sqrt(12059.58)=109.807 MeV.

So, K_mu = 109.807-105.7=4.107 MeV. So round to two decimal places, 4.11 MeV.

The options have option D as 4.12 and 29.8, which is very close. So that's the answer.

The problem involves finding the kinetic energies of the muon (mu(+)) and the neutrino (nu) in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is treated as massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest mass energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (\(E_\nu = p_\nu\)).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is stationary, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p\), the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
139.6^2 = (\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 + 2p\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2p\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]
Substituting numerical values:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
2p\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Dividing:
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**: Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   K_\nu = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**: The total energy of the muon is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   29.784^2 = 887.1, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.1 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.59} = 109.807 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.807 - 105.7 = 4.107 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV**  
**B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV**  
**C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV**  
**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. So, Pi(+) is at rest initially. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Oh right, because the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

The masses given are the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are really light, almost massless. So I can probably treat the neutrino as having zero mass. That should simplify things.

So the problem is about finding the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino after the decay. But wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy is going to be really high because it's massless. Hmm, but let me think about the energy conservation here.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi(+) because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon has rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV, and its total energy is the sum of its rest mass and kinetic energy. The neutrino's total energy would just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

So energy conservation equation: Energy of Pi(+) = Energy of muon + Energy of neutrino.

So, 139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + K_mu) + K_nu.

But I also have to use the momentum conservation. Since Pi is at rest, the momenta of mu and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude.

The energy of each particle is related to their momentum and mass. For the muon, the total energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² → but since we're working in units where c=1, it's just sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²). Similarly, for the neutrino, since mass is zero, energy is just p_nu.

Because p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), let's call this common value p.

So, the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and the neutrino's energy is p.

So substituting back into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

Hmm, that's a tricky equation to solve for p. Let me write it down:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p + p².

So,

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

The p² terms cancel out:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

Moving terms around:

2 *139.6 p = 139.6² - 105.7².

Let me compute each term numerically.

139.6 squared: Let's see,

140^2 = 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, but wait, 139.6 is in MeV, so (139.6)^2 = (139.6)^2. Let me compute that accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

Let's compute 140 *140 = 19600.

But since it's 139.6, that's 140 *140 minus (0.4 *140 *2) minus (0.4)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 139.6 *139.6.

Hmm, 139.6 * 139.6 = ?

Let me think:

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100² is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

So,

2 *139.6 p = (19488.16) - (11172.49) = 8315.67 MeV².

Therefore, p = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6).

2 *139.6= 279.2.

So p= 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 279.2: 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me calculate:

279.2 × 29 ≈ 279*30=8370, but 29 is 279.2 ×29=8096.8. Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, 279.2 × 29.8 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376, minus 0.2 *279.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16.

Hmm, so 279.2 ×29.8 ≈8320.16. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less. So p≈29.8 - (8320.16 -8315.67)/(279.2).

The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49. So 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So p≈29.8 -0.016≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units here: since the rest masses are in MeV/c², and p is in MeV/c. So p = 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is just p, which is approximately 29.784 MeV.

The energy of the muon is sqrt(p² + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute that.

29.784^2 ≈ 887.1 (since 30^2=900, so 29.784 is a bit less, about 887.1).

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So adding: 887.1 + 11172.49 = 12059.59.

Square root of 12059.59: sqrt(12059.59) ≈ let's see, 110^2=12100, so it's about 109.8 (since 109.8^2= (110-0.2)^2=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04), which is close to 12059.59.

So sqrt(12059.59) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So the muon's total energy is approximately 109.8 MeV.

But its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7=4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again. Because when I computed sqrt(887.1 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.59)= approximately 109.807 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.807 -105.7=4.107 MeV.

And the neutrino's KE is p, which is ~29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations to make sure.

Wait, when I computed 2*139.6*p = 139.6² -105.7² = 19488.16 - 11172.49=8315.67.

So p=8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do that division again. 279.2 × 29=8096.8. 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So 29 + 0.783=29.783. So p≈29.783 MeV/c.

So neutrino KE is 29.783 MeV.

Muon's total energy: sqrt(29.783^2 + 105.7^2) = sqrt(887.09+11172.49)=sqrt(12059.58)=109.807 MeV.

So, K_mu = 109.807-105.7=4.107 MeV. So round to two decimal places, 4.11 MeV.

The options have option D as 4.12 and 29.8, which is very close. So that's the answer.


The problem involves finding the kinetic energies of the muon (mu(+)) and the neutrino (nu) in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is treated as massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest mass energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (\(E_\nu = p_\nu\)).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is stationary, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p\), the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
139.6^2 = (\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 + 2p\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2p\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]
Substituting numerical values:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
2p\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Dividing:
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**: Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   K_\nu = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**: The total energy of the muon is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   29.784^2 = 887.1, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.1 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.59} = 109.807 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.807 - 105.7 = 4.107 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV**  
**B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV**  
**C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV**  
**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
