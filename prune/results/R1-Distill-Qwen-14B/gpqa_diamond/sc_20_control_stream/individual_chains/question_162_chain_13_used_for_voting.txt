Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's see if I can work through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because the differentials are dx² and dy². So it's a metric on a 2D surface. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere... I remember a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But I'm not sure if this metric describes a pseudosphere.

Let me think about the general form of metrics. Pseudospheres are often described in isothermal coordinates, right? So maybe this is an isothermal metric. Isothermal coordinates have metrics that look like λ²(dx² + dy²), where λ is a function of x and y. Here, the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So maybe λ² = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So λ would be sqrt(32/(4 - r²)), if I use polar coordinates where r² = x² + y².

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So that's 4 - r². So the domain of this metric is defined where 4 - r² > 0, so r² < 4. So r < 2. So the radius here is up to 2. But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given might have Gaussian curvature that's constant. To find the area, I might need to compute the Gaussian curvature and see if it's negative.

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = f(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²) can be found using the formula involving the Laplacian of ln(f). Wait, right, the formula is K = - (1/(2 f²)) * Δ(ln f), where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D. Or maybe I'm mixing up the signs. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is that for a metric ds² = e^{2λ(x,y)} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{-2λ} ( (λ_xx + λ_yy) ), where λ_xx is the second derivative with respect to x, and same for y. So in this case, since f(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)), I can write it as f = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²). Or maybe it's better to work with λ = (1/2) ln(f²), so f squared is 32/(4 - r²).

So f² = 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) = (1/2) [ln(32) - ln(4 - r²)] = (1/2) [ln32 - ln(4 - r²)].

Wait, actually, let me compute K. Because to find the area, perhaps I don't need the curvature but just the area element. Alternatively, if it's a pseudosphere, which has a specific area, maybe I can figure it out from the metric.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is 4π, I think. No, wait, a sphere of radius a has area 4πa². A pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic sphere, but I'm not sure about its area. Wait, maybe for a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is infinite? Because hyperbolic spaces are unbounded. But wait, a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Oh, right, the tractricoid, which is topologically a sphere, has finite area.

Wait, but the metric here might be that of a pseudosphere. Let me check the Gaussian curvature. For a pseudosphere, the curvature is a negative constant. So let's compute K.

Given ds² = f² (dx² + dy²), then K = (-1/f²) * [ (f_x)_x + (f_y)_y ) ].

Alternatively, using the formula for K in terms of the metric:

K = [ - (f_x x f_y y) + (f_x y)² ) ] / f^4.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me consider f(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

So first, I need to compute the derivatives of ln f. Because the formula for K is K = - (1/(2 f²)) * [ ( (f_x)/f )_x + ( (f_y)/f )_y ) ].

Wait, so ln f = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

So the first derivative of ln f with respect to x is (1/2) [ (0)/(32/(4 - r²)) ) * ( derivative of denominator ) ]? Wait, no, better to compute it directly.

ln f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - x² - y²).

So, the partial derivative of ln f with respect to x is:

(1/2) * [ (0)/(32) ) - ( (-2x) / (4 - x² - y²) ) ) ] ?

Wait, no, more accurately:

d(ln f)/dx = (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2x) ) / (4 - x² - y²) ) ].

So that's (1/2) * ( 2x / (4 - x² - y²) ) ) = x / (4 - x² - y²).

Similarly, the second derivative would involve the derivative of that expression.

So (d² ln f)/(dx²) = [ (4 - x² - y²) * 1 - x*( -2x ) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Which simplifies to [ (4 - x² - y²) + 2x² ] / denominator squared.

So numerator becomes 4 + x² - y².

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to y is:

(d² ln f)/(dy²) = [ (4 - x² - y²) *1 - x*(0) - y*(-2y) ] / denominator squared.

So that's [ (4 - x² - y²) + 2y² ] / denominator squared.

So numerator is 4 - x² + y².

Wait, but in any case, adding the two second derivatives:

d² ln f / dx² + d² ln f / dy² = [ (4 + x² - y²) + (4 - x² + y²) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. The numerators add:

(4 + x² - y²) + (4 - x² + y²) = 4 +4 + (x² -x²) + (-y² + y²) = 8.

So the sum is 8 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So (d² ln f)/(dx²) + (d² ln f)/(dy²) = 8/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Then, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - [ (d² ln f)/(dx²) + (d² ln f)/(dy²) ) ] / (2 f² )

Wait, no, another formula I've seen is K = - (1/(2 f²)) [ (f_x)^2 + (f_y)^2 ) ].

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = [ - (f_xx f_yy + f_xy^2 ) + (f_x^2 + f_y^2) ] / (2 f^4). Hmm, getting confused. Maybe let me look up the formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates.

Wait, I remember that for isothermal coordinates, the Gaussian curvature simplifies. Isothermal coordinates are those where ds² = λ²(dx² + dy²). Then, the Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - (1/λ²) * ( (λ_xx + λ_yy) ).

So in this case, λ is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)), so λ² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So 1/λ² is (4 - x² - y²)/32.

The Laplacian of λ is λ_xx + λ_yy.

So, let's compute λ first. λ = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Compute λ_x: the derivative of sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) with respect to x.

That's (1/(2*sqrt(...))) ) * [ (0 * (4 - r²)) - 32 * (-2x) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ].

Wait, perhaps better to compute λ = (32)^(1/2) * (4 - r²)^(-1/2), where r² = x² + y².

So λ = sqrt(32) * (4 - r²)^(-1/2).

So λ_x = sqrt(32) * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2x) ) 

= sqrt(32) * (x) (4 - r²)^(-3/2 )

Similarly, λ_xx = derivative of that.

Let me compute the derivatives step by step.

λ = sqrt(32) * (4 - r²)^(-1/2).

So λ_r = sqrt(32) * (-1/2) * (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r) )

= sqrt(32) * r (4 - r²)^(-3/2 )

Wait, because r is sqrt(x² + y²), so ∂r/∂x = x/r, ∂r/∂y = y/r.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in polar coordinates, considering the metric's symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the metric is spherically symmetric, so in polar coordinates (r, φ), with x = r cos φ, y = r sin φ, the metric would be ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) [ dr² + r² dφ² ].

Wait, that would be the metric in polar coordinates. So the area element is sqrt(-det g) dr dφ, or, since the metric is diagonal, just (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dφ.

Wait, the area would be the integral of the area element over the region. So the area A is ∫∫ (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dφ. But what are the limits? Since 4 - r² must be positive, r² <4, so r goes from 0 to 2. φ goes from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dφ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r², then du = -2 r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * ( - du/(2) ) from u=4 to u=0.

So flipping the limits, it's ∫ from 0 to4 [32/(u)] (du/2) ) → (32/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

Which is 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4. But wait, as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches -infty. So integrating from 0 to4 would give 16 [ ln4 - (-infty) ) ] which is infinite.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the area would be infinite. But the options include option D which is +infty. So perhaps the area is infinite. But I thought a pseudosphere has finite area.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area. Because in the metric given, the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element go to infinity. So the integral becomes divergent. That would mean the area is infinite.

But the question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, maybe the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. Because if the area is infinite, that wouldn't make sense for a pseudosphere, which should have finite area.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the area element.

Wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt( det g ), but since g is diagonal, it's just g_rr g_φφ. So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dφ.

Yes, that's correct.

So integrating from r=0 to 2: ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr.

But let's compute it step by step.

Integral of r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me let u =4 - r², du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So integral becomes ∫ [1/u ] * (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0):

At r=2, u=0: ln(0) is -infty.

So the integral is [ (-1/2) (ln u ) ] evaluated from 4 (u=4) to 0 (u=0).

So [ (-1/2)(-infty) ) - (-1/2)(ln4) ) ] → (infty) + (1/2 ln4).

Which is infinity.

So the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere of radius 2. A pseudosphere should have finite area. So perhaps the given metric isn't of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the area is finite because the metric is defined only in a certain region.

Wait, but the integral is diverging, so the area is infinite, which would make the answer D) +infty.

But wait, the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So if r <2, the denominator is positive. But wait, could this be a metric on a surface that's compact, like a sphere? Because if the area is infinite, that would suggest it's not compact. But a sphere is compact, so the area would be finite.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is conformally flat but has a singularity at r=2, making the area infinite beyond that point.

Wait, but the question is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Maybe the pseudosphere of radius 2 is just the surface at r=2, but that's a circle, so its area would be... no, pseudosphere is a 2D surface, so its area would be finite.

Alternatively, perhaps because the metric coefficient becomes infinite at r=2, the area up to r=2 is infinite.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me review the options. The options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So, the area can't be zero, because that would imply no space. Option B and C are expressions in x and y, which don't make sense because the area should be a number, not dependent on position.

So we're left with A, which is 0, or D, which is infinity.

But from the integral, the area is infinite, so the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere with finite area.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature and see if it's constant. Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature.

Earlier, we started calculating the Gaussian curvature K. Let me proceed.

Given λ = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)), so λ squared is 32/(4 - r²).

Then, K = - (1/λ²) [ λ_rr + (λ_r / r) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in polar coordinates. So in polar coordinates, the Laplacian of ln λ is:

∇² ln λ = (1/r) d/dr ( r d(ln λ)/dr )

Because in 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is (1/r) d/dr (r f_r) + (1/r²) d² f/dφ². But since the function is radially symmetric, the φ derivative is zero.

So f(r) = ln λ = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

So f_r = (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2r) / (4 - r²) ) ] = (r)/(4 - r²).

Then, ∇² f = (1/r) d/dr ( r * (r)/(4 - r²) )

= (1/r) d/dr [ r² / (4 - r²) ) ]

Let me compute that derivative.

Let me let u = r², denominator = 4 - u.

So derivative inside is d/dr [ u / (4 - u) ) ].

Using quotient rule: [ (4 - u) * (du/dr) ) - u * (-du/dr) ] / (4 - u)^2.

du/dr = 2r.

So numerator becomes (4 - u) 2r + u 2r = 2r (4 - u + u ) = 2r *4 =8r.

Denominator is (4 - u)^2.

So the derivative is 8r/(4 - u)^2.

So ∇² f = (1/r) * [8r/(4 - u)^2 ] ) = 8/(4 - u)^2.

But u is r², so 4 - u =4 -r².

Thus, ∇² f =8/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, since K = - (1/λ²) * ∇² f.

And λ² is 32/(4 - r²).

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Simplify:

(4 - r²) cancels except for in the denominator, so (4 - r²)^2 in denominator.

So,

K = - [ 8 (4 - r²) ) / (32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ) ]

= - [8 / (32 (4 - r²) ) ]

Simplify 8/32 → 1/4.

So K= - [ 1/(4(4 - r²)) ) ].

Wait, so the Gaussian curvature K is not a constant. It varies with r. That seems odd because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So this metric doesn't describe a pseudosphere. Hmm, but the question says to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the metric provided isn't the pseudosphere, but the question is based on a different assumption.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed ∇² f, I had f = ln λ, and computed ∇² f =8/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, K= - (1/λ²) * ∇² f.

λ² is 32/(4 - r²).

So,

K= - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ]

= - [8 (4 - r²) ) / (32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

The (4 - r²) in the numerator and denominator cancels once, leaving (4 - r²) in the denominator.

So,

= - [8 / (32 (4 - r²) ) ]

= - [1/(4 (4 - r²)) ) ]

Which is -1/(16 -4 r²) ?

Wait, no, 4*(4 - r^2) is 16 -4 r^2? No, wait, 4*(4 - r²) is 16 -4 r²? No, 4*(4 - r²)= 16 -4 r²? Wait, 4*(4) is 16, 4*(-r²) is -4 r². So, yes.

Wait, but this doesn't look right because a pseudosphere should have constant negative curvature. So maybe this is not a pseudosphere, but another surface. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is that of a sphere. Because when radius is 2, and if curvature is positive, the area would be finite. But according to the earlier integral, the area is infinite. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. But the given metric's area is infinite because the integral diverges. So the answer is D) +infty.

But wait, the pseudosphere has a finite area. So maybe the question is expecting me to recognize that the area is 4π r^2, but for r=2, that would be 4π*(4)=16π. But that's a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Hmm, but that's not one of the options, except option B and C are expressions, not numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the given metric may not be a pseudosphere. But the question states: What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? So maybe the metric given isn't relevant. But the options suggest that the correct answer is either 4π(x² + y²), etc., which don't make sense, or zero or infinity.

Wait, but perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere. Because the metric resembles the metric for a sphere in 3D, but perhaps in 2D it's a different case.

Wait, another approach: The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me note that 4 - x² - y² = (2)^2 - r², where r is the radial coordinate.

If I make a substitution: let’s define a new variable z = (x^2 + y^2)/4. Then 4 - r² =4(1 - z), so 1 - z = (4 - r²)/4 → z =1 - (4 - r²)/4 = (r²)/4.

Wait, I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conformal metric with f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 -r²)).

Wait, maybe the area can be calculated as 4π, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere's area is 4π, regardless of radius. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is usually given as 4π, same as a unit sphere. But I'm not entirely sure. But if that's the case, and the radius is 2, perhaps the area would scale with the square of the radius. So 4π*(2)^2 =16π. But that doesn't match any of the options given.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4π(x² + y²), which can't be the area because it's position dependent. Similarly, option C is 4π(x² - y²), which is also position dependent. So these can't be correct.

Option A is zero, which is unlikely. Option D is infinity.

So based on the integral I did earlier, the area is infinite, which suggests the correct answer is D.

But then why the question refers to a pseudosphere? Because a pseudosphere should have finite area.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the metric. Perhaps it's not covering the entire pseudosphere, but only a portion, leading to infinite area. Or maybe the metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about it differently. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its area is finite. So perhaps the given metric does not represent a pseudosphere, but a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

But the question is about the pseudosphere, not the hyperbolic plane.

Alternatively, the given metric might represent a portion of the pseudosphere, but the area is finite. But the integral suggests it's infinite.

Wait, perhaps the metric is for a sphere embedded in a higher dimension, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the area is calculated differently. Wait, the metric is ds² = (32/(4 -x² -y²))(dx² + dy²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dφ.

So integrating from r=0 to r=2:

Area = ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dφ.

As we saw earlier, the inner integral is divergent.

So the area is infinite, so the answer is D) +infty.

But then the question is about a pseudosphere, which has finite area. So perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, but the question is correct in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should just choose D as the answer. The area is infinite.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To determine this, we analyze the metric and compute the area element.

### Step 1: Area Element
The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \( f(x, y) = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}} \). The area element in such a metric is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos \phi, y = r \sin \phi \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\phi.
\]

### Step 2: Limits of Integration
The domain of the metric is restricted by the condition \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \), which implies \( r < 2 \). Thus, the limits of integration are \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \) and \( \phi = 0 \) to \( \phi = 2\pi \).

### Step 3: Computing the Area
The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\phi.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) and \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln |u| \), so:

\[
16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to infinity. This indicates that the area is infinite.

### Step 4: Interpretation
The metric describes a surface with a singularity at \( r = 2 \), causing the area to diverge. While a pseudosphere (a surface of constant negative curvature) typically has finite area, the given metric does not correspond to a pseudosphere. Instead, it describes a surface with infinite area, likely due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

### Step 5: Analysis of Options
- **Option A (\( 0 \))**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \))**: Incorrect, as the area should be a constant, not dependent on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \))**: Incorrect, for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct, as shown by the divergent integral.

### Final Answer
The area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \). 

**Answer: D**
