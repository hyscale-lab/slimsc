Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the answers. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts: part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B asks which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A, and between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for part B.

First, let me tackle part A: which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in the same molecule through a different arrangement. For example, in enols and ketones. The necessary condition for tautomerism is the presence of adjacent carbonyl groups or the possibility of forming a conjugated system after the proton shift.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone, right? So the structure is like O=C6H4=O, but the carbonyls are in para positions. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but regardless, it's two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene. So, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Because for tautomerism, you need an adjacent proton that can shift. If the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, in benzoquinone, the oxygen atoms are double-bonded to carbon. So perhaps it's not in a position to have adjacent H's that can shift. Alternatively, maybe that's not the right point.

Wait, benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but wait, no, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So each O is double-bonded to a carbon, and those carbons are attached to the benzene. So each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two benzene carbons and an oxygen. So the structure is O=C-O? No, wait, no. Benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is on the benzene. So the structure is benzene with two ketone groups opposite each other (para).

Can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually involves a keto-enol tautomerism, where the proton moves from an oxygen to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, each attached to two other ring carbons. So each carbonyl is part of the ring, so the adjacent carbons are in the ring. So maybe there's no H adjacent to the carbonyl to shift because the carbons are all part of the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait, maybe benzoquinone is just two carbonyl groups on benzene, so each is in a position where they can't have a hydrogen adjacent. For example, in a cyclohexane, if you have two ketones opposite each other (like in cyclohexane-1,3-dione), that molecule can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but does it?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3-dione has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. So, the structure is O=C-C-C-O=C. So, those two carbonyls are separated by one carbon. Oh wait, no, 1,3 would be two carbons apart. So, maybe in such a case, the molecule can undergo tautomerism. Because in 1,3-dione, the protons adjacent to each carbonyl are on the same carbon, so perhaps a tautomerism is possible, leading to an enol form.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are on opposite positions of the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is on a benzene carbon, each attached to two other benzene carbons. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached (as in C6H4), so I don't think benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism because there's no H adjacent to the carbonyl groups to shift.

Wait, but wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound. The benzene ring is fully conjugated, so the carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring. So, in that case, maybe the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the adjacent positions don't have H's.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: that's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3, and 5, so every other carbon. So, the structure would have O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C, all in a ring. So, each carbonyl group is separated by CH groups. So, in this case, each carbonyl is adjacent to two CH groups. So, perhaps the molecule can undergo tautomerism because each carbonyl is next to a CH, which has H's that can shift.

Wait, but can a compound with three ketone groups undergo tautomerism? Let me think. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that can shift from one atom (like O) to another, causing the structure to change. Alternatively, in the keto-enol form, the H moves from the oxygen to an adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in tricyclic compounds, perhaps the H's on the adjacent carbons can shift. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group? Or CH groups?

Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. 1,3,5-trione—so every alternate carbon is a carbonyl. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C? No, that can't be right because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon connected to two others in the ring. So, each carbonyl is attached to two CH groups. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH groups (which have H's). So, perhaps the H's on those CH groups can shift, leading to tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the trione can't undergo tautomerism because the structure is too rigid. Hmm.

Wait, benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C6H6O3). So, for part A, which doesn't show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the adjacent carbons don't have H's, then the cyclohexane trione would. So, the correct A would be that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism? Or the opposite?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Tautomerism is possible when there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon, which is bonded to two other benzene carbons. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which typically doesn't have H's attached because benzene is sp² hybridized and each carbon is bonded to one H (if it's mono-substituted), but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's part of the ring, so the adjacent carbons are each attached to two substituents (the ring carbons). Wait, no, each ring carbon in benzene is attached to one substituent (the ring), so in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected to two other ring carbons. So, the adjacent carbons would each have two substituents (the ring carbons) and perhaps one H. Wait, but in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon connected to two other ring carbons, so each has one H attached.

Wait, so each carbonyl is O=C-C6H3-O=C. So, each carbonyl carbon is attached to two other ring carbons (CH groups) and an O. So, in that case, each of those CH groups has H's adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the H is on the adjacent CH, can it shift? Let me imagine: the H is on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in benzoquinone, the structure is O=C–C–C–O=C (in the ring). So, each of the adjacent carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) have H's. So, maybe the H can shift from the adjacent carbon to the oxygen, leading to a tautomer.

Wait, but in that case, the H is on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, when it shifts, it would form an enol. But wait, I thought that tautomerism usually involves moving between keto and enol forms. So, in the case of benzoquinone, could that happen?

Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, the H's are in positions that can't easily shift because of the ring's conjugation. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider which of the two (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) can or cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: It's a conjugated di-ketone. I think para-benzoquinone is more stable, but does it undergo tautomerism? I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't because the H's are in a conjugated system that makes tautomerism difficult.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this is a cyclic triketone. Each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each of those CH2 groups has H's that can shift, allowing for tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but if the question is asking for which one does NOT show tautomerism, then A would be the one that doesn't. So, if benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the H's are in positions that don't allow for the necessary conjugation. I'm a bit stuck on this part.

Moving on to part B: which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism.

The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I think its structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So, the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, and the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon of the propanoate.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So, methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that's a chiral center. The carbon attached to the OH, the COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Let me see: the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(CH3)(OH)

Wait, no, the structure is more like: 

CH3
|
C(OH)-COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) has an OH, a COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)
|
CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 (from the third carbon? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first CH3),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the carbon from the COOCH3.

Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

- first carbon (CH3),

- OH,

- third carbon (COOCH3),

- and another hydrogen? No, because in propanoate, the chain is three carbons. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Let me draw it:

The second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- first carbon: CH3,

- third carbon: COOCH3,

- an OH,

- and another H (since it's CH(OH) in the middle).

Wait, no, that's possible. So, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, the central carbon (second) has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that's a chiral center. So, this compound can have enantiomers, so it shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait: in the ester methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me count the substituents.

The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from the right),

- and another CH2 group? No, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),

2. OH,

3. COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

4. and another H.

Wait, no: the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's CH2(OH) in this context? Wait, no, if it's CH(OH), that implies a CH with an OH, so the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, wait, the third carbon is COOCH3, which is a carbonyl group. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, that would make four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H, which are all different. So, yes, the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond between the two middle carbons, leading to a cis configuration. So, fumarate would have the two ester groups on the same side (cis), while maleate would have them trans.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. Let me confirm: maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, with the double bond in the cis configuration. Then, when it's esterified, the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2CCHCHCOOCH3? Wait, no, wait: dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond. No, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, fumarate would be (CH3O)2C-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3

So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Therefore, this molecule has a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. No, wait, because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is the cis isomer, so its diethyl ester is cis, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, but if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, that would make the molecule achiral. Because it would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule could be symmetrical.

But wait, dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is not symmetrical. Because, imagine looking at the double bond: if the two COOCH3 groups are trans (opposite), then the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Wait, let me imagine: if one ester is on the top of the double bond, and the other is on the bottom, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, it would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait: when you have a double bond with two identical groups on opposite sides, the molecule is achiral. For example, 1,2-dichloroethylene is symmetric and thus not chiral. So, if dimethyl fumarate has the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer. If the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3

In this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about the structure again. If the two ester groups are on the same side (cis), then the molecule would be chiral because there's no plane of symmetry, allowing for enantiomers. But if they're trans, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Wait, but wait: dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer, right? Because fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, in the ester, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetric, hence not chiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but then what about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Earlier, I thought it has a chiral center, so it would show optical isomerism.

So, part B is asking which of the two (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would, because it has a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't, because it's symmetric.

Wait, but wait: I might have made a mistake in the analysis of dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Thus, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think is that the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But in reality, I think dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound. Wait, is that possible?

A meso compound has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two stereocenters but is achiral.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the two ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to the molecule being a meso compound, hence achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Therefore, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, putting it together:

A) The compound that doesn't show tautomerism is either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, earlier I was confused about whether benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Let me think again. Benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are each connected to two ring carbons and one H. So, each of those adjacent carbons has an H that could potentially shift.

But in practice, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm trying to recall. I think that tautomerism in aromatic compounds is less common because the aromatic system is conjugated, making such shifts less favorable. But in some cases, like with phthalic anhydride, tautomerism is possible, but I'm not sure about benzoquinone.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism. Wait, no, because each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, so the H's are available.

Wait, maybe I should look up whether benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. But since I can't look it up, I have to rely on reasoning.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 group has H's that can shift, leading to enol forms. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, on the other hand, has the two carbonyl groups on the ring, each with adjacent H's. So, perhaps it can also undergo tautomerism. But wait, the ring's conjugation might make such shifts difficult. Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring, so the H's are not in a position to shift easily.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the necessary H isn't present. Wait, no, each carbonyl in benzoquinone is attached to a carbon that has an H, so tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but if both compounds can undergo tautomerism, then the question is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps neither can, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. But earlier reasoning suggested it does.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up tautomerism with keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by a CH2 group, so perhaps each can undergo enolization. But in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated into the benzene ring, making it more like a quinone structure. Quinones are known to undergo enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait, quinones are typically involved in electron transfer reactions, but do they undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, I think that para-benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, known as the quinonoid form. But in some contexts, such as in aromatic compounds, tautomerism can lead to resonance structures, but perhaps that's not the same as enol tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

But the question is asking which does NOT show tautomerism.

If I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, from earlier analysis, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate that shows optical isomerism. So, the only options where part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are options A and B.

So, in the options, part A is either cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione or benzoquinone.

I think I should go back to part A. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, then A is the one that doesn't, which would be benzoquinone.

Alternatively, if benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

If I have to choose, I think cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism because each carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, allowing H shifts, whereas benzoquinone's carbonyls are conjugated into the ring, making tautomerism difficult or impossible.

Thus, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (the one that doesn't show tautomerism).

Wait, no, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism, then the compound that doesn't is benzoquinone.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think differently.

If the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism, and I think that benzoquinone doesn't, then A is benzoquinone.

Then, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier, I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.

Wait, but option B's part A is benzoquinone, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if A is benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism), then the correct option is option B.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so the correct part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Thus, part A is benzoquinone, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves between atoms, typically involving adjacent carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring in a para configuration. The carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons are bonded to the ring, making it difficult for a proton to shift. Thus, benzoquinone does not readily undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring, with each carbonyl adjacent to a CH₂ group. The protons on these CH₂ groups can shift, allowing tautomerism to occur. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with a trans configuration. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, creating a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the answers. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts: part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B asks which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A, and between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for part B.

First, let me tackle part A: which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in the same molecule through a different arrangement. For example, in enols and ketones. The necessary condition for tautomerism is the presence of adjacent carbonyl groups or the possibility of forming a conjugated system after the proton shift.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone, right? So the structure is like O=C6H4=O, but the carbonyls are in para positions. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but regardless, it's two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene. So, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Because for tautomerism, you need an adjacent proton that can shift. If the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, in benzoquinone, the oxygen atoms are double-bonded to carbon. So perhaps it's not in a position to have adjacent H's that can shift. Alternatively, maybe that's not the right point.

Wait, benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but wait, no, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So each O is double-bonded to a carbon, and those carbons are attached to the benzene. So each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two benzene carbons and an oxygen. So the structure is O=C-O? No, wait, no. Benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is on the benzene. So the structure is benzene with two ketone groups opposite each other (para).

Can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually involves a keto-enol tautomerism, where the proton moves from an oxygen to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, each attached to two other ring carbons. So each carbonyl is part of the ring, so the adjacent carbons are in the ring. So maybe there's no H adjacent to the carbonyl to shift because the carbons are all part of the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait, maybe benzoquinone is just two carbonyl groups on benzene, so each is in a position where they can't have a hydrogen adjacent. For example, in a cyclohexane, if you have two ketones opposite each other (like in cyclohexane-1,3-dione), that molecule can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but does it?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3-dione has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. So, the structure is O=C-C-C-O=C. So, those two carbonyls are separated by one carbon. Oh wait, no, 1,3 would be two carbons apart. So, maybe in such a case, the molecule can undergo tautomerism. Because in 1,3-dione, the protons adjacent to each carbonyl are on the same carbon, so perhaps a tautomerism is possible, leading to an enol form.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are on opposite positions of the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is on a benzene carbon, each attached to two other benzene carbons. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached (as in C6H4), so I don't think benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism because there's no H adjacent to the carbonyl groups to shift.

Wait, but wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound. The benzene ring is fully conjugated, so the carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring. So, in that case, maybe the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the adjacent positions don't have H's.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: that's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3, and 5, so every other carbon. So, the structure would have O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C, all in a ring. So, each carbonyl group is separated by CH groups. So, in this case, each carbonyl is adjacent to two CH groups. So, perhaps the molecule can undergo tautomerism because each carbonyl is next to a CH, which has H's that can shift.

Wait, but can a compound with three ketone groups undergo tautomerism? Let me think. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that can shift from one atom (like O) to another, causing the structure to change. Alternatively, in the keto-enol form, the H moves from the oxygen to an adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in tricyclic compounds, perhaps the H's on the adjacent carbons can shift. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group? Or CH groups?

Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. 1,3,5-trione—so every alternate carbon is a carbonyl. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C? No, that can't be right because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon connected to two others in the ring. So, each carbonyl is attached to two CH groups. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH groups (which have H's). So, perhaps the H's on those CH groups can shift, leading to tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the trione can't undergo tautomerism because the structure is too rigid. Hmm.

Wait, benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C6H6O3). So, for part A, which doesn't show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the adjacent carbons don't have H's, then the cyclohexane trione would. So, the correct A would be that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism? Or the opposite?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Tautomerism is possible when there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon, which is bonded to two other benzene carbons. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which typically doesn't have H's attached because benzene is sp² hybridized and each carbon is bonded to one H (if it's mono-substituted), but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's part of the ring, so the adjacent carbons are each attached to two substituents (the ring carbons). Wait, no, each ring carbon in benzene is attached to one substituent (the ring), so in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected to two other ring carbons. So, the adjacent carbons would each have two substituents (the ring carbons) and perhaps one H. Wait, but in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon connected to two other ring carbons, so each has one H attached.

Wait, so each carbonyl is O=C-C6H3-O=C. So, each carbonyl carbon is attached to two other ring carbons (CH groups) and an O. So, in that case, each of those CH groups has H's adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the H is on the adjacent CH, can it shift? Let me imagine: the H is on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in benzoquinone, the structure is O=C–C–C–O=C (in the ring). So, each of the adjacent carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) have H's. So, maybe the H can shift from the adjacent carbon to the oxygen, leading to a tautomer.

Wait, but in that case, the H is on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, when it shifts, it would form an enol. But wait, I thought that tautomerism usually involves moving between keto and enol forms. So, in the case of benzoquinone, could that happen?

Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, the H's are in positions that can't easily shift because of the ring's conjugation. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider which of the two (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) can or cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: It's a conjugated di-ketone. I think para-benzoquinone is more stable, but does it undergo tautomerism? I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't because the H's are in a conjugated system that makes tautomerism difficult.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this is a cyclic triketone. Each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each of those CH2 groups has H's that can shift, allowing for tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but if the question is asking for which one does NOT show tautomerism, then A would be the one that doesn't. So, if benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the H's are in positions that don't allow for the necessary conjugation. I'm a bit stuck on this part.

Moving on to part B: which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism.

The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I think its structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So, the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, and the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon of the propanoate.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So, methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that's a chiral center. The carbon attached to the OH, the COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Let me see: the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(CH3)(OH)

Wait, no, the structure is more like: 

CH3
|
C(OH)-COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) has an OH, a COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)
|
CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 (from the third carbon? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first CH3),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the carbon from the COOCH3.

Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

- first carbon (CH3),

- OH,

- third carbon (COOCH3),

- and another hydrogen? No, because in propanoate, the chain is three carbons. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Let me draw it:

The second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- first carbon: CH3,

- third carbon: COOCH3,

- an OH,

- and another H (since it's CH(OH) in the middle).

Wait, no, that's possible. So, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, the central carbon (second) has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that's a chiral center. So, this compound can have enantiomers, so it shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait: in the ester methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me count the substituents.

The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from the right),

- and another CH2 group? No, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),

2. OH,

3. COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

4. and another H.

Wait, no: the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's CH2(OH) in this context? Wait, no, if it's CH(OH), that implies a CH with an OH, so the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, wait, the third carbon is COOCH3, which is a carbonyl group. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, that would make four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H, which are all different. So, yes, the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond between the two middle carbons, leading to a cis configuration. So, fumarate would have the two ester groups on the same side (cis), while maleate would have them trans.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. Let me confirm: maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, with the double bond in the cis configuration. Then, when it's esterified, the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2CCHCHCOOCH3? Wait, no, wait: dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond. No, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, fumarate would be (CH3O)2C-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3

So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Therefore, this molecule has a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. No, wait, because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is the cis isomer, so its diethyl ester is cis, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, but if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, that would make the molecule achiral. Because it would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule could be symmetrical.

But wait, dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is not symmetrical. Because, imagine looking at the double bond: if the two COOCH3 groups are trans (opposite), then the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Wait, let me imagine: if one ester is on the top of the double bond, and the other is on the bottom, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, it would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait: when you have a double bond with two identical groups on opposite sides, the molecule is achiral. For example, 1,2-dichloroethylene is symmetric and thus not chiral. So, if dimethyl fumarate has the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer. If the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3

In this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about the structure again. If the two ester groups are on the same side (cis), then the molecule would be chiral because there's no plane of symmetry, allowing for enantiomers. But if they're trans, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Wait, but wait: dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer, right? Because fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, in the ester, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetric, hence not chiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but then what about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Earlier, I thought it has a chiral center, so it would show optical isomerism.

So, part B is asking which of the two (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would, because it has a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't, because it's symmetric.

Wait, but wait: I might have made a mistake in the analysis of dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Thus, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think is that the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But in reality, I think dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound. Wait, is that possible?

A meso compound has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two stereocenters but is achiral.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the two ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to the molecule being a meso compound, hence achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Therefore, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, putting it together:

A) The compound that doesn't show tautomerism is either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, earlier I was confused about whether benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Let me think again. Benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are each connected to two ring carbons and one H. So, each of those adjacent carbons has an H that could potentially shift.

But in practice, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm trying to recall. I think that tautomerism in aromatic compounds is less common because the aromatic system is conjugated, making such shifts less favorable. But in some cases, like with phthalic anhydride, tautomerism is possible, but I'm not sure about benzoquinone.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism. Wait, no, because each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, so the H's are available.

Wait, maybe I should look up whether benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. But since I can't look it up, I have to rely on reasoning.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 group has H's that can shift, leading to enol forms. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, on the other hand, has the two carbonyl groups on the ring, each with adjacent H's. So, perhaps it can also undergo tautomerism. But wait, the ring's conjugation might make such shifts difficult. Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring, so the H's are not in a position to shift easily.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the necessary H isn't present. Wait, no, each carbonyl in benzoquinone is attached to a carbon that has an H, so tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but if both compounds can undergo tautomerism, then the question is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps neither can, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. But earlier reasoning suggested it does.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up tautomerism with keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by a CH2 group, so perhaps each can undergo enolization. But in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated into the benzene ring, making it more like a quinone structure. Quinones are known to undergo enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait, quinones are typically involved in electron transfer reactions, but do they undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, I think that para-benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, known as the quinonoid form. But in some contexts, such as in aromatic compounds, tautomerism can lead to resonance structures, but perhaps that's not the same as enol tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

But the question is asking which does NOT show tautomerism.

If I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, from earlier analysis, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate that shows optical isomerism. So, the only options where part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are options A and B.

So, in the options, part A is either cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione or benzoquinone.

I think I should go back to part A. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, then A is the one that doesn't, which would be benzoquinone.

Alternatively, if benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

If I have to choose, I think cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism because each carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, allowing H shifts, whereas benzoquinone's carbonyls are conjugated into the ring, making tautomerism difficult or impossible.

Thus, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (the one that doesn't show tautomerism).

Wait, no, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism, then the compound that doesn't is benzoquinone.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think differently.

If the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism, and I think that benzoquinone doesn't, then A is benzoquinone.

Then, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier, I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.

Wait, but option B's part A is benzoquinone, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if A is benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism), then the correct option is option B.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so the correct part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Thus, part A is benzoquinone, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves between atoms, typically involving adjacent carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring in a para configuration. The carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons are bonded to the ring, making it difficult for a proton to shift. Thus, benzoquinone does not readily undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring, with each carbonyl adjacent to a CH₂ group. The protons on these CH₂ groups can shift, allowing tautomerism to occur. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with a trans configuration. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, creating a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B
