Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. We're supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem says mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu is proportional to Sz. Sz is the spin component in the z-direction, which for spin-1/2 can be ± ħ/2. But I'm not sure if the units are important here; maybe since gamma is given, the actual values will work out.

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle is aligned, so its magnetic moment is in the same direction. So the spin must be up in the z-direction. Then, the field is switched to +Y. So the magnetic field changes direction, but remains the same magnitude.

Wait, how does the magnetic moment evolve when the field changes? I think when the field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction. So the magnetic moment will start to precess around the Y-axis, which would cause its components in other directions (like Z) to oscillate.

I remember that the oscillation frequency in such cases is related to the energy difference between the spin states. For a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, the energy is U = -mu · B. For spin-1/2, when the field is along a particular axis, the energy levels are split into two: one with +mu and one with -mu.

But in this problem, the field is initially along Z, then switched to Y. So after the switch, the magnetic field is along Y. The system will precess around Y, leading to oscillations in the z-component of the magnetic moment.

Wait, let me think about the Hamiltonian here. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. Oh wait, wait: mu = gamma S, so H = -mu · B. Since the magnetic field is along Y, n would be in Y direction. So H = -gamma B (S_y component? Or wait, S · B direction. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no: H is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the field. So mu = gamma S, so H = - mu · B. If B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S is a vector operator. So in terms of spin matrices, S_y is the Pauli matrix times ħ/2. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact form, but perhaps that's getting too detailed for this problem.

The key thing is that when the magnetic field is along Y, the energy levels depend on S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energies are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) * (1/2?) Wait, let me think. Wait, S is in units of ħ, so for spin-1/2, S_y can be ± ħ/2. So H would have eigenvalues E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2).

Wait, wait: The magnetic moment mu = gamma S, so when B is along Y, the energy is U = - mu · B = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along Y, then U = -gamma B S_y.

The energy levels for the spin-up and spin-down states about Y would be E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), but I think I might be missing a factor. Wait, S has eigenvalues (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energies are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) * something. Wait, maybe it's E = -gamma B (S_y), but S_y is ħ/2 * sigma_y. Hmm, perhaps the exact expression is E = -gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y). But energy levels would be E = ± gamma B (ħ/2) * (something). Wait, perhaps I should focus on the energy difference.

The energy difference between the two states is Delta E = E_up - E_down. But wait, when the field is along Y, the spin-up state along Y would have higher energy if the magnetic moment is aligned. Wait, no: energy is U = -mu · B. So if mu is in the same direction as B, U is negative, which is lower energy. So when the field is along Y, the state with S_y = +ħ/2 (so mu_y = gamma (ħ/2)) would have energy U = -gamma B (ħ/2). The other state would have U = +gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference between them is Delta E = (+gamma B (ħ/2) ) - (-gamma B (ħ/2)) ) = gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference is 2 * (gamma B ħ/2) )? Let me compute that again. The two energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). So the difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = -gamma B ħ. Hmm, but the magnitude is gamma B ħ.

Wait, but wait, the frequency of oscillation is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. Because E = h f, so f = E/h. So the transition frequency would be (Delta E) / h = (gamma B ħ) / h. But ħ is h/(2π), so substituting, that gives (gamma B (h/(2π)) ) / h ) = gamma B / (2π) * (1/(h) ) * h )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here.

Alternatively, the Larmor frequency is given by the energy difference divided by ħ. Because E = ħ omega, so omega = (Delta E) / ħ.

So the energy difference is Delta E = 2 * (gamma B * (ħ/2)) ) = gamma B ħ. So omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm. So when the field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y, making the z-component oscillate.

The time evolution of a spin in a magnetic field can be found using the Hamiltonian. The spin state will precess around the field direction, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of the spin components.

In the case where the field is along Y, the spin precesses about the Y-axis. So the expectation value of Sz (the z-component of spin) will oscillate sinusoidally with some frequency.

What's the frequency of this oscillation? I think it's related to the energy splitting, which depends on the field strength and gamma.

Wait, the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), so the energy difference is gamma B ħ. So the angular frequency (omega) is given by omega = (energy difference) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency should be gamma B.

But wait, the options include gamma*B, option B. So why isn't the frequency just gamma B, which is option B?

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting, which would give omega = gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when the spin is in a magnetic field along Y, the precession angular frequency about Y is determined by the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ). So H = -gamma B S_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

The exponential becomes exp( i (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y t / ħ ) ) = exp( i (gamma B/2 ) sigma_y t ). Because ħ cancels out.

Wait, so sigma_y is the Pauli matrix. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for the eigenstates along Y. So the time evolution operator can be written as exp( i (gamma B/2 ) t sigma_y ).

But to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin. The initial state was aligned along +Z, so S_z = +1/2 ħ, so initial state is |+z>.

But after the field is turned on along Y, the state will start precessing. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate with time.

The time evolution of the expectation value of S_z can be found using the time-dependent state. Let me think about this.

The state at time t is |psi(t)> = exp( -i H t / ħ ) |+z> .

But H is proportional to S_y, so the exponential will cause rotation about the Y-axis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write H as proportional to sigma_y. Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

H = -gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y )

So H = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So the exponential is exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y/2 ) t ).

So the operator is rotation around Y by angle theta = (gamma B t). Because the rotation operator is exp( -i theta sigma_y /2 ), so here theta is (gamma B t), and the operator is exp( i gamma B t sigma_y / 2 ). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong. Maybe it's exp( -i theta sigma_y /2 ), so theta here would be (gamma B t) * (-1), but the exponential's argument is i times something. Hmm, maybe I should look at the general form of the rotation operator.

The rotation operator around Y by angle phi is R_y(phi) = exp( -i phi S_y / ħ ) = exp( -i phi sigma_y /2 ).

So in this case, H is proportional to S_y, and the time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B S_y t ) / ħ ). Because H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, let's compute this:

H = - gamma B S_y.

So H t / ħ = ( - gamma B S_y t ) / ħ.

So the exponential becomes exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ ).

But S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so substituting:

exp( i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t sigma_y / 2 ).

Which is the same as exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) sigma_y ).

The rotation operator around Y is R_y(theta) = exp( -i theta sigma_y / 2 ), so this is equivalent to R_y(-gamma B t).

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up with the signs. Alternatively, perhaps the time evolution under H leads to a precession about Y with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

So the state |psi(t)> is R_y(omega t) |+z>.

So the initial state is |+z>, and the rotation about Y by angle omega t will cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate.

The expectation value of S_z at time t is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Expressed in terms of the rotation, the expectation value will be the component of S_z after rotation about Y by angle theta=omega t.

The expectation value of S_z in the rotated state can be found using the rotation matrices. For spin-1/2, the rotation of a state about Y by angle theta will change its z-component.

The expectation value of S_z after rotation about Y by theta is S_z cos(theta) + S_x sin(theta) * something? Wait, perhaps it's better to express the state after rotation.

The initial state is |+z> which is (1,0) in the computational basis. Rotating around Y by theta would mix the x and z components.

Wait, let me think in terms of the rotation matrix. The rotation matrix around Y by angle theta is:

R_y(theta) = [
[ cos(theta/2), -sin(theta/2) ],
[ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]
]

So applying this to the initial state |+z> = (1,0), we get:

R_y(theta) |+z> = [ cos(theta/2), -sin(theta/2) ]^T.

The expectation value of S_z is then [ <psi| S_z |psi> ].

S_z is represented by the Pauli matrix sigma_z multiplied by ħ/2. So sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The state after rotation is ( cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ).

So the expectation value is ( (cos(theta/2))² * (1) ) + ( (sin(theta/2))² * (-1) ) ) * ħ/2.

Because:

<psi| S_z |psi> = (ħ/2) [ (cos(theta/2))² - (sin(theta/2))² ) ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) cos(theta).

Because cos^2 x - sin^2 x = cos(2x).

Wait, but wait:

Wait, (cos(a))^2 - (sin(a))^2 = cos(2a).

So in our case, a is theta/2, so 2a is theta.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(theta).

But theta is the rotation angle. What is theta in terms of the parameters?

In our case, the rotation is from the time evolution, which is theta = gamma B t.

Wait, earlier we found that theta = gamma B t because the time evolution operator was R_y(theta) with theta = gamma B t.

Wait, no, because when H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution is exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ ). And S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so substituting:

exp( i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t /2 ) sigma_y )

So the rotation angle is theta = gamma B t.

So the expectation value <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(theta) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but wait, if theta is gamma B t, then the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so the average mu_z is gamma <S_z>.

So <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So the oscillation is cos(gamma B t), meaning the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but wait: earlier when I thought about the energy difference, I thought the oscillation frequency was gamma B. So this seems consistent.

But let me recheck the options. Option B is gamma*B.

So the answer should be option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment, **μ_z**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator: **μ = γS**.  
   - When the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle is aligned, and its spin is in the +Z direction.  
   - After the field is switched to +Y, the particle's spin precesses around the Y-axis due to the new magnetic field.

2. **Hamiltonian**:  
   - The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is **H = -μ · B**.  
   - Since the field is along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes **H = -γB S_y**, where **S_y** is the y-component of the spin operator.

3. **Energy Levels**:  
   - The eigenvalues of **S_y** for a spin-1/2 particle are **±ħ/2**.  
   - The corresponding energy levels are **E = ±γB(ħ/2)**.  
   - The energy difference between the two states is **ΔE = γBħ**.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   - The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant:  
     \[
     f = \frac{\Delta E}{h} = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{h}.
     \]
   - Using the relation **ħ = h/(2π)**, this simplifies to **f = γB**.

5. **Expectation Value of μ_z**:  
   - The z-component of the magnetic moment, **μ_z**, oscillates sinusoidally due to the precession around the Y-axis.  
   - The oscillation frequency of **μ_z** matches the energy splitting frequency, which is **γB**.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is **γB**, corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu is proportional to Sz. Sz is the spin component in the z-direction, which for spin-1/2 can be ± ħ/2. But I'm not sure if the units are important here; maybe since gamma is given, the actual values will work out.

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle is aligned, so its magnetic moment is in the same direction. So the spin must be up in the z-direction. Then, the field is switched to +Y. So the magnetic field changes direction, but remains the same magnitude.

Wait, how does the magnetic moment evolve when the field changes? I think when the field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction. So the magnetic moment will start to precess around the Y-axis, which would cause its components in other directions (like Z) to oscillate.

I remember that the oscillation frequency in such cases is related to the energy difference between the spin states. For a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, the energy is U = -mu · B. For spin-1/2, when the field is along a particular axis, the energy levels are split into two: one with +mu and one with -mu.

But in this problem, the field is initially along Z, then switched to Y. So after the switch, the magnetic field is along Y. The system will precess around Y, leading to oscillations in the z-component of the magnetic moment.

Wait, let me think about the Hamiltonian here. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. Oh wait, wait: mu = gamma S, so H = -mu · B. Since the magnetic field is along Y, n would be in Y direction. So H = -gamma B (S_y component? Or wait, S · B direction. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no: H is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the field. So mu = gamma S, so H = - mu · B. If B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S is a vector operator. So in terms of spin matrices, S_y is the Pauli matrix times ħ/2. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact form, but perhaps that's getting too detailed for this problem.

The key thing is that when the magnetic field is along Y, the energy levels depend on S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energies are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) * (1/2?) Wait, let me think. Wait, S is in units of ħ, so for spin-1/2, S_y can be ± ħ/2. So H would have eigenvalues E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2).

Wait, wait: The magnetic moment mu = gamma S, so when B is along Y, the energy is U = - mu · B = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along Y, then U = -gamma B S_y.

The energy levels for the spin-up and spin-down states about Y would be E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), but I think I might be missing a factor. Wait, S has eigenvalues (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energies are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) * something. Wait, maybe it's E = -gamma B (S_y), but S_y is ħ/2 * sigma_y. Hmm, perhaps the exact expression is E = -gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y). But energy levels would be E = ± gamma B (ħ/2) * (something). Wait, perhaps I should focus on the energy difference.

The energy difference between the two states is Delta E = E_up - E_down. But wait, when the field is along Y, the spin-up state along Y would have higher energy if the magnetic moment is aligned. Wait, no: energy is U = -mu · B. So if mu is in the same direction as B, U is negative, which is lower energy. So when the field is along Y, the state with S_y = +ħ/2 (so mu_y = gamma (ħ/2)) would have energy U = -gamma B (ħ/2). The other state would have U = +gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference between them is Delta E = (+gamma B (ħ/2) ) - (-gamma B (ħ/2)) ) = gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference is 2 * (gamma B ħ/2) )? Let me compute that again. The two energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). So the difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = -gamma B ħ. Hmm, but the magnitude is gamma B ħ.

Wait, but wait, the frequency of oscillation is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. Because E = h f, so f = E/h. So the transition frequency would be (Delta E) / h = (gamma B ħ) / h. But ħ is h/(2π), so substituting, that gives (gamma B (h/(2π)) ) / h ) = gamma B / (2π) * (1/(h) ) * h )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here.

Alternatively, the Larmor frequency is given by the energy difference divided by ħ. Because E = ħ omega, so omega = (Delta E) / ħ.

So the energy difference is Delta E = 2 * (gamma B * (ħ/2)) ) = gamma B ħ. So omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm. So when the field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y, making the z-component oscillate.

The time evolution of a spin in a magnetic field can be found using the Hamiltonian. The spin state will precess around the field direction, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of the spin components.

In the case where the field is along Y, the spin precesses about the Y-axis. So the expectation value of Sz (the z-component of spin) will oscillate sinusoidally with some frequency.

What's the frequency of this oscillation? I think it's related to the energy splitting, which depends on the field strength and gamma.

Wait, the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), so the energy difference is gamma B ħ. So the angular frequency (omega) is given by omega = (energy difference) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency should be gamma B.

But wait, the options include gamma*B, option B. So why isn't the frequency just gamma B, which is option B?

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting, which would give omega = gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when the spin is in a magnetic field along Y, the precession angular frequency about Y is determined by the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ). So H = -gamma B S_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

The exponential becomes exp( i (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y t / ħ ) ) = exp( i (gamma B/2 ) sigma_y t ). Because ħ cancels out.

Wait, so sigma_y is the Pauli matrix. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for the eigenstates along Y. So the time evolution operator can be written as exp( i (gamma B/2 ) t sigma_y ).

But to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin. The initial state was aligned along +Z, so S_z = +1/2 ħ, so initial state is |+z>.

But after the field is turned on along Y, the state will start precessing. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate with time.

The time evolution of the expectation value of S_z can be found using the time-dependent state. Let me think about this.

The state at time t is |psi(t)> = exp( -i H t / ħ ) |+z> .

But H is proportional to S_y, so the exponential will cause rotation about the Y-axis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write H as proportional to sigma_y. Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

H = -gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y )

So H = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So the exponential is exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y/2 ) t ).

So the operator is rotation around Y by angle theta = (gamma B t). Because the rotation operator is exp( -i theta sigma_y /2 ), so here theta is (gamma B t), and the operator is exp( i gamma B t sigma_y / 2 ). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong. Maybe it's exp( -i theta sigma_y /2 ), so theta here would be (gamma B t) * (-1), but the exponential's argument is i times something. Hmm, maybe I should look at the general form of the rotation operator.

The rotation operator around Y by angle phi is R_y(phi) = exp( -i phi S_y / ħ ) = exp( -i phi sigma_y /2 ).

So in this case, H is proportional to S_y, and the time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B S_y t ) / ħ ). Because H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, let's compute this:

H = - gamma B S_y.

So H t / ħ = ( - gamma B S_y t ) / ħ.

So the exponential becomes exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ ).

But S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so substituting:

exp( i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t sigma_y / 2 ).

Which is the same as exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) sigma_y ).

The rotation operator around Y is R_y(theta) = exp( -i theta sigma_y / 2 ), so this is equivalent to R_y(-gamma B t).

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up with the signs. Alternatively, perhaps the time evolution under H leads to a precession about Y with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

So the state |psi(t)> is R_y(omega t) |+z>.

So the initial state is |+z>, and the rotation about Y by angle omega t will cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate.

The expectation value of S_z at time t is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Expressed in terms of the rotation, the expectation value will be the component of S_z after rotation about Y by angle theta=omega t.

The expectation value of S_z in the rotated state can be found using the rotation matrices. For spin-1/2, the rotation of a state about Y by angle theta will change its z-component.

The expectation value of S_z after rotation about Y by theta is S_z cos(theta) + S_x sin(theta) * something? Wait, perhaps it's better to express the state after rotation.

The initial state is |+z> which is (1,0) in the computational basis. Rotating around Y by theta would mix the x and z components.

Wait, let me think in terms of the rotation matrix. The rotation matrix around Y by angle theta is:

R_y(theta) = [
[ cos(theta/2), -sin(theta/2) ],
[ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]
]

So applying this to the initial state |+z> = (1,0), we get:

R_y(theta) |+z> = [ cos(theta/2), -sin(theta/2) ]^T.

The expectation value of S_z is then [ <psi| S_z |psi> ].

S_z is represented by the Pauli matrix sigma_z multiplied by ħ/2. So sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The state after rotation is ( cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ).

So the expectation value is ( (cos(theta/2))² * (1) ) + ( (sin(theta/2))² * (-1) ) ) * ħ/2.

Because:

<psi| S_z |psi> = (ħ/2) [ (cos(theta/2))² - (sin(theta/2))² ) ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) cos(theta).

Because cos^2 x - sin^2 x = cos(2x).

Wait, but wait:

Wait, (cos(a))^2 - (sin(a))^2 = cos(2a).

So in our case, a is theta/2, so 2a is theta.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(theta).

But theta is the rotation angle. What is theta in terms of the parameters?

In our case, the rotation is from the time evolution, which is theta = gamma B t.

Wait, earlier we found that theta = gamma B t because the time evolution operator was R_y(theta) with theta = gamma B t.

Wait, no, because when H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution is exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ ). And S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so substituting:

exp( i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t /2 ) sigma_y )

So the rotation angle is theta = gamma B t.

So the expectation value <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(theta) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but wait, if theta is gamma B t, then the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so the average mu_z is gamma <S_z>.

So <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So the oscillation is cos(gamma B t), meaning the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but wait: earlier when I thought about the energy difference, I thought the oscillation frequency was gamma B. So this seems consistent.

But let me recheck the options. Option B is gamma*B.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment, **μ_z**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator: **μ = γS**.  
   - When the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle is aligned, and its spin is in the +Z direction.  
   - After the field is switched to +Y, the particle's spin precesses around the Y-axis due to the new magnetic field.

2. **Hamiltonian**:  
   - The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is **H = -μ · B**.  
   - Since the field is along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes **H = -γB S_y**, where **S_y** is the y-component of the spin operator.

3. **Energy Levels**:  
   - The eigenvalues of **S_y** for a spin-1/2 particle are **±ħ/2**.  
   - The corresponding energy levels are **E = ±γB(ħ/2)**.  
   - The energy difference between the two states is **ΔE = γBħ**.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   - The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant:  
     \[
     f = \frac{\Delta E}{h} = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{h}.
     \]
   - Using the relation **ħ = h/(2π)**, this simplifies to **f = γB**.

5. **Expectation Value of μ_z**:  
   - The z-component of the magnetic moment, **μ_z**, oscillates sinusoidally due to the precession around the Y-axis.  
   - The oscillation frequency of **μ_z** matches the energy splitting frequency, which is **γB**.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is **γB**, corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B
